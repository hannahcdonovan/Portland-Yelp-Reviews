0,"WOW. Street & Co is certainly the spot for romantics! It's cozy, and I love that the kitchen has an open concept. It feels like you have your own personal chefs for the night. 

We ordered the Lobster Diavolo, which comes with a whole lobster split in half, tons of clams, mussels, a sprinkle of squid all served on top of a bed of pasta with flavorful, spicy tomato sauce. IT WAS AH-MAZING. I can't even. When I moved to Maine, THIS WAS EXACTLY what I was looking for when I envisioned seafood galore! 

Also, they serve unlimited butter and bread!"
1,"We ordered oysters while waiting for dinner, which were served quickly and were fresh and delicious. The bread and butter, and our appetizers of yellowfin tuna and artic char Pate were also great (also the char has a slight bitter taste, fyi). 

All of this made us so excited for dinner. We ordered blackened char and the scallops pernod. And when they came out, our eyes were bright and our mouths were watering. But then we tasted the food and it was just overpowering with saltiness. Everything was wayyyy or a bit too salty. We scraped all the seasoning off the artic char and it was still too salty. Not to mention the greens. A bummer, since we were so excited to visit this spot from out of town. 

The service was also great. We were just disappointed by the main event. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing...

We told them and they took one of our entrees off the tab. Wow. What a great restaurant and great servers. We'll definitely try again."
2,"If you're visiting Portland, you absolutely have to come here. If you aren't able to snag a reservation, make sure to show up early - around 4:45 - to get a table or seat at the bar which is full service. 

Their oysters come with the most amazing mignonette sauce you'll ever have and the lobster fra diavolo for two is incredible. HUGE portion - a whole lobster, baby octopus, calamari, mussels, and clams on top of linguine. 

You'll definitely be walking away happy and with leftovers!"
3,"Great oysters selection and phenomenal grilled lobster over linguini.
Highly recommend this restaurant!"
4,"Absolutely fabulous meal! Was able to snag a reservation while visiting Portland on OpenTable and so glad we did! Cozy little place, with great service, good wine and amazing food! We had the grilled lobster linguine which was to die for, and also the scallops. The lobster linguine definitely took the cake. Scallops were so so. Overall though, would highly recommend and will be back when in Portland."
5,"Great atmosphere, service and food! The Lobster Diavolo is probably the best pasta dish that I have ever had. The local Bangs Island Mussels and grilled octopus were amazing! This is a place that I would really like to bring our out of town guests to. My wife and I loved it and will definitely be back!"
6,"This review is from Thursday, Oct 18, 2018.

How fortunate we were to have this restaurant in walking distance of our hotel.  The valet recommended this location and show did my cell recommendations.  We couldn't find a park, so we drove our car back to the hotel and took a walk.  This place was packed.  The people we were in line behind, said they had reservations, we did not.  We were seated in the bar area and spoke to a couple who currently reside in Colorado, but stated that they have been to this restaurant many times because they love it.  He went on to state that he got reservations the moment they were opened up. Ok.  This place should be good.  Long lines, reservations and a wonderful aroma.

We ended up waiting about thirty minutes for our table, but it was so worth it.  Our order was put in right away and we nibbled on some of their bread while we waited for our meal.

The Grilled Lobster on Linguine, Butter and Garlic was superb.  This meal was well worth the $39.95.  Please see the picture showing how I devoured it.  My dinner mate opted for the ahi tuna with broccolini in a pesto sauce and some roasted red potatoes.  I don't do raw fish (just slightly cooked on the outside and raw in the inside), so I can't say how her fish tasted (she really enjoyed it), but the broccolini was delicious.  It just had a hint of pesto and lemon.  Very tasty.  

Here's What I Think...I want to go back to Maine, just so I can enjoy this meal again."
7,"We almost decided to go somewhere else when we found out the wait for 4 was a hour on Sunday night, but I'm so glad we decided trust Yelp this time! They had their lobster diavalo since the pictures from others looks so epic, and I can confirm it is indeed epic! The pasta was super tasty, the seafood in it had so much flavor, and if was massive! Definitely the thing to order for a hungry group. 
We also got the garlic shrimp pasta, which was heavenly and tasted amazing, definitely recommended. The pasta with scallops and affredo sauce was not too good though, it's on the heavy side with way too much cream and cheese, but that's what it is supposed to be so can't complain there, should have gotten their pan seared scallop dish instead."
8,"When in Maine... one must eat lobster!?! This restaurant is hidden away in a cobblestone alleyway. The lines are quite long, and it took us an hour to get in for dinner without a reservation. It was worth it. Inside, it looks like a food cellar in colonial times with all the vegetables hanging from the celings.

For the food, I split a bunch of dishes with my friends since the serving sizes are quite large. The lobster bread pudding for an appetizer was so rich and definitely a pleasant surprise. Typically, I thought bread puddings were supposed to be sweet desserts. This was really well balanced and there are chunks of lobster that, combined with the vegetables, cheese, and bread pudding, made for a really good mouth feel that was packed with flavor.

The main dish was the lobster diavolo for 2. Technically, I probably could have eaten this type of dish in Boston at some place supposedly called Giacomo's. I'll have to update my review when I actually go there to compare. The sauce is really good, which is a tomato based sauce that probably has white wine and herbs. It has all the juices of the mussels, lobsters, clams, and calamari. There is so much pasta beneath the seafood. If you have the stomach for it, make sure to order extra bread to dip into the sauce! To be honest, for normal people, this dish could probably be split with 3-4 people.

Our other friends got some pastas and we ended up trading some of our dish to get theirs. One was the Scallops in Pernod and Cream pasta, and it comes inside the pan they cook it in?!? The white sauce is really delicious, and the scallops are tender and quite big. I think I stole a lot of those..heheh. The other pasta was the Shrimp with Butter and Garlic linguine. This dish was also quite good, but I didn't have time to eat much because it disappeared so fast. It's very buttery, and the shrimps were pretty fresh. Again, the sauce is so good on all of these pastas that you just have to soak it up in bread, gluten-free critics and low carb diets be damned.

Somehow we made room for dessert. On our way to the tables, I could see the pies sitting out in the kitchen and they looked so good. Maine is probably famous for blueberries, but I decided to get a pecan pie, They heat it up in the oven and you can get it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Really decadent way to close out the probably 100000 calorie meal we just consumed. 

The service here is excellent, and they even give you warm towels with lemon if you eat any of the lobsters since it can get messy cracking open the shells."
9,"Follow the wisdom of the crowds here and just get the Lobster Fra Diavolo for two. Trust me.

The other dishes are solid and don't quite justify the price point, but all that is forgiven again by how excellent the Fra Diavolo is both in price and in quality.

But oh yeah, don't skip dessert. The bourbon pecan pie was one of the most balanced takes on the sweet I've had to date- not overly sweet or gloopy. Do yourself a favor and add a scoop of ice cream to round it all out."
10,"Went in January and there were only two reservation options open: first seating or last. We decided on an early dinner and headed over. It was right next to or hotel so we arrived before they started seating. The bartender was very friendly. He talked about a new cocktail he was working on that wasn't on the menu yet. It sounded good so we acted as guinea pigs for him- it was good, very good.

The dining room has a nice cozy feel. We were seated next to a group of guys who were discussing plans for opening a summer camp and it was a great conversation to eavesdrop on.

For appetizers we had grilled octopus and a simple salad. Both were excellent. I had blackened char for my entree and my wife had lobster with linguine. My fish was cooked perfectly and the side of potatoes and broccolini were great. Hers came with an entire split, grilled lobster and once we shucked that bad boy it was delicious in the garlicky sauce. Made good leftovers for when we got home too!

All and all this might have been the food highlight of our trip to Portland (maybe a tie with central provisions). 

The wine and beer menu presented a lot of options. We both loved a Greek white that was available that I cannot remember how to spell."
11,"Brought my boyfriend here for his graduation celebration dinner! Was disappointed with the food as it was incredibly bland this time around. 

I probably will try a new seafood restaurant the next time I come through Portland. 

Ordered the following and pictured below:
Mussels
Goat cheese
Swordfish
Goat cheese salad"
12,"Excellent mussels and bread.  Small cocktails and salty potato leek soup.  Nice atmosphere although a bit packed in. I had octopus and it was sorta greasy and the salad was just okay.  A lot of people were getting the Lobster diavolo it looked pretty good but messy to eat.  Also saw the clams and linguini in white sauce and that looked awesome.  With so much fresh seafood and restaurants in Portland, I won't be going back here.  Sorry no pictures"
13,"Lobster Diavolo. 
WOW. 
It was a bit pricey... but so worth it. Split between 2 people, we were left super full and satisfied. 
The bread they also give in the beginning is really good. I always make the mistake of eating too much of it.. but worth it.
The seafood pasta with lobster on top was amazing. They did not skimp out on the seafood. So many mussels and clams. All the seafood tasted fresh too. My only complaint is that the some parts of the lobster meat was watery/mushy. 

Also, it's $70 for this dish FYI (not $50 as it says on yelp haha)

But you should still do it. 

If i'm back in portland, i'm so down to have this again."
14,"To get: Lobster Diavolo 

It was impossible to get a reservation online so I was super excited when we were seated right after we walked in! My boyfriend and I shared the Lobster Diavolo and it was so large that we had dinner for the next day (though, we may also have been full from the 1.5 bread loaves we consumed). The flavor was good and it had a little bit of everything- pasta and all kinds of fish! Our waitress was very kind and the atmosphere was perfect- much like their other restaurants. Would love to come back and enjoy more seafood..."
15,"Phenomenal!

Walking into the restaurant from the cobblestone streets was in itself delightful! My boyfriend's buddy recommended this place to us when we took a weekend get-a-away together. Unfortunately, it was back in November and I can not list what my boyfriend and I ordered because we both ordered the specials of the night! (See pictures below)

I can vouch that both meals were absolutely delicious! My fish was cooked perfectly! So creamy, super moist, and its meaty texture satisfied my appetite.

The service was exceptional. Our waitress made sure we had everything we needed and could not have been more helpful in listing all the ingredients so we were aware of what was in the food. There were so many great options it was hard to choose from.

Fresh catches of seafood from Maine with local fresh grown produce. What more can you ask for!"
16,I can't think of a single issue to not go 5 stars!  Made our reservation more than a month out and were pretty seated in the packed place as soon as we walked in.  I had the grilled octopus to start and it was amazing! Save some bread to mop up all the goodies on the plate.  My wife's scallops were cooked to perfection and my shrimp and capers in a red sauce over linguine was about as perfect as can be.   Great wine selection.  My friend had the apple pie/crisp with ice cream and i stole a few bites and it was what was need on a cold night.
17,"This is an absolute must if you are anywhere near the state of Maine. Street & co is some of the best seafood you can find anywhere- period.  My absolute favorite is the scallops in Pernod which is pictured. 

You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't make a point of eating here.  I've been going to Portland for summers for about 15 years and Street & Co. continues to be my favorite restaurant."
18,"This is my 6th time back here... so that's telling you how good this place is!! It's definitely a MUST try place if you ever visit Portland, Maine. We had to skip lunch in order to make this dinner worth it. We got the lobster diavolo (for two), grilled octopus, fresh tuna, and oysters. Everything tasted so delicious and we got our seafood cravings fixed. We will be coming back to try their popular scallops and other dishes on the menu soon :)"
19,"I made my reservation almost 6 weeks in advance and that should be indication enough that this is a must try.

Based on the reviews and pictures, I had to have the lobster diavolo and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Even my husband who prefers not to have seafood or pasta couldn't get enough of it. The dish was well worth the price as it was loaded with fresh seafood and that lobster on top was phenomenal. Buttery soft, super flavorful and just cooked perfectly. Loaded with clams, mussels and calamari and more pasta than you could ever need, we were full for days. There was enough food for us to even take it home and have another two meals out of it, and we eat a lot. 

The ambiance was great, the open kitchen is super fun and everyone was friendly. The next time i'm back in Portland I will definitely be back here again. The rest of the menu looked delicious and there was so much I wanted to try."
20,"I had the opportunity to dine here while on a business trip this week. The grilled octopus was out standing, the best I have ever had.  The spicy swordfish dolmas were packed with flavor.  The service was impeccable and extremely fast given the time of night. 

The kitchen is a clean impressive operation. They are efficient and the food is as beautiful as it is tasty. Thanks folk. 

For an after dinner liquid snack stop by Mash Tun  next door.   For a wonderful atmosphere and craft beer selection."
21,"So we planned a trip to portland and I made a reservation 2 months in advance for this place. It's a little hole in the wall in my opinion because I walked past it twice before finding it with google maps. It wasn't that busy since we went a few minutes after they opened so we got seated and ordered pretty quickly.

Our server was easy going and we already knew what we wanted since we looked at their menu online the previous day.

The portions matched the price and we actually had leftovers that night. Which is surprising since we ate everything we ordered at other restaurants. Our server was also nice enough to pack a doggy bag for us that night. Then there's the water boy.... do they have a water boy? He came over a few times to make sure our glasses were always full. 

We left with full bellies and it was a hefty hearty meal. Normally seafood gets me full but its light and I dont feel like I'm about to knock out for the night but this place gave me that feeling and I really enjoyed that."
22,"Very fancy restaurant, and I'm glad my friends and I tried this place during our Portland trip. Service is excellent as expected, and the food was really good, though I was super stuffed when we were barely into the lobster diavolo! Highly recommend if you can spend a bit of money and want to try some good seafood in a nice ambience."
23,"I have found the best destination for anyone interested in the best of the best in Portland. We enjoyed the Brandade and Blackened Halibut. The seasoning was a perfect match for the serving. 

I loved the Lemond Drop Martini and Bourbon Pecan Pie while there, too.

Alice was an amazing server.

Thank you, Alice!"
24,Ambiance is top notch.  I would come back here anytime.  Oysters I did not love (and I love oysters) so that shocked me.  And I did 2 of everything they had that night.  My meal however - the scallops - were TO DIE FOR.  Service was also wonderful.
25,"This is still one of my favorite restaurants in th rd Portland area.  I've yet to have a bad meal here as the food is always well prepared.  My only complaint would be this restaurant books put months in advance so if you want to ensure a reservation, plan ahead."
26,Great for a date night. Cozy bar area. Dining area was a little crammed and loud which made it difficult to have a conversation. But overall a great dining experience. The Sole Franchisee accompanied with roasted potatoes and broccoli was nicely seasoned. The lobster with butter and garlic over linguini is a great meal for someone with a big appetite. The portion sizes are reasonable for the price. We would definitely be back for another date night.
27,"Excellent food, I got the broiled lobster with linguine and it was amazing. It comes in standard white sauce or spicy red sauce. Both were really good. The lobster you get is around 1.5 lbs on a sizzling pan. The dessert is also to die for. I got the some vanilla pudding thing (top thing on the menu) and it was out of this world. If you are ever in down town Portland you have to give this place a try. The only issue is that there may be a wait due to the popularity of this restaurant. Put your name down and walk around the street. There's a lot going on lol."
28,"The food was inoffensive. Folks had raved to us about Street & Co. and its family of restaurants, so when reservations appeared we jumped at the chance. Service was good, atmosphere was nice, but the food left a lot to be desired. The mussels were tasty and well prepared, but the rest of our meal was ""...fine."" The shrimp and linguine would've been a hit in any New Jersey Italian joint, but we expected a bit more. The blackened halibut was well cooked, but cold by the time it got to us and severely underseasoned. A little salt goes a long way. And the drinks weren't well balanced. Maybe folks were struggling tonight?

Street is great if you've got family in town that needs to watch their salt intake or thinks lemon is ""too spicy."" Otherwise go somewhere exceptional like Drifters Wife."
29,"Amazing food, the oysters were some of the best I've ever had. The staff was extremely attentive and spot on even on a very busy night. I had the muscles and my boyfriend had the lobster and both were 10/10. Definitely come here if you love food seafood. Amazing large drink selection as well. will definitely be back!!"
30,"Spent three days in Portland and this was my lowest point. Good service but the food we ordered (Scallops) 35$ plus I legit spit out into my napkin. It had at least $35 worth of salt in it. Wouldn't go back, would never recommend to anyone. A shame, you'd think if you're paying top dollar for seafood they'd at least make it edible."
31,"A must when you are in Portland. I had Eventide oyster for lunch and was satisfied with oysters but not my other seafood cravings so I wanted to go to another seafood restaurant for dinner. There were 2 of us on a Wednesday night and we got a table right away. The decor was very comfy and trendy at the same time with warm lights, exposed brick walls, and dried hanging seasoning plants. 

We got the whole fish of the day which was Branzino. The fish was cooked perfectly. The sauce was tomato based and on the heavier/saltier side but it complements the fish when you eat it together. If the sauce is tone downed a little, the dish would be spot on. 

The other dish we had was the scallops (in the pan section of the menu). The scallops were very soft and melts in the mouth. The sauce and the grains were amazing. I also dipped the bread with the sauce and was very full after eating the whole dish

Food=5
Price= 4.5 (considering location/ingredients)
Service =4 ( our server had flat affect but everyone else was friendly) 

Would definitely come back again when visiting!"
32,"Everyone get the strawberry rhubarb pie and thank me later!!

Per previous reviews, anticipate approximately an hour wait. It was definitely worth the wait! My boyfriend and I came here and only ordered the Lobster Diavolo for 2, approximately ~60. It's a huge pot of linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, and a lobster. This was the ONLY thing we ordered, no bread, no appetizer, nada, and we were full out of our minds. This dish alone was enough for dinner and lunch the next day! The linguine was cooked perfectly. The seafood was fresh. The lobster meat was so tender. The dish was a teeny bit spicy, but overall, awesome taste and deal! 

We never skip on dessert, so we ordered panna cotta and the strawberry rhubarb pie, a la mode. I would 1000% advise you to order the rhubarb pie. The crust is made of cornmeal, but it was crumbly, warm, and buttery and absolutely awesome with ice cream and the tart, sweet, strawberry rhubarb filling. It was so good that we asked if they sold whole pies... to go. Unfortunately the answer was no. But, yes my fellow yelpers, get that rhubarb pie. 

If I were to return to Maine again, I'm almost sure to, I will definitely come back here!"
33,"If you are looking for good Italian food, this is not the place for you. I ordered calamari linguine in white sauce, it had no salt and no flavor. I asked for cheese to add some seasoning, the waitress with blonde side bangs rolled her eyes. She threw the utensils on the table when serving my boyfriend as well. Our waitress was extremely rude and considering that we were the only ones treated that way, it makes me think she was racist."
34,"I've been looking for some nicer restaurants to take my wife to when visiting my family and it fell between Street & Co and Eventide. Street & Co fell short of expectations.

The restaurant is more upscale casual. Tables are very close together. 

The food skewed great to average. I loved our muscles. Best I've ever had. Great portion. Generous for 2, adequate for 3, lean for 4. 

The entrees were okay.

The seafood was cooked well but it was not prepared well. I don't mind a bit of interaction with my food at a restaurant of this caliber, but I wasn't a fan of scraping the lobster tail meat out and cracking and scraping the meat out of the claws for my lobster dish. My wife was also not thrilled about every other bite of her Branzino containing bones. It was also light on flavor.

Wine was great, service was average, food was average.

I prefer Gilbert's Chowder House or DiMillo's."
35,"It cannot be denied this place does solid seafood dishes. Cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Their lobster pasta diavolo is the most popular. It is delicious indeed and full of flavor. It's honestly a pound of pasta and generous amounts of seafood (clams, squid, mussels and a whole lobster).
They had a crabmeat mushroom pasta appetizer that evening that I found to be far superior to the lobster dish. It's a different flavor profile (not dosed in heavy handed garlic or tomato...phew) which I enjoyed far more. I wish I ordered a double portion for dinner.
I've had their scallops in Pernod cream in the past, delicious but the sides are so uninspiring. And I remember the grain (farro) was a bit underdone to my liking. For the cost of these dishes ($30+) I expect a bit more for the accompaniments to a seafood plate than a spoonful of whatever grain cooked en masse and a vegetable.

Wait time/hard to get reservations+price+cramped space = maybe a once a year off season during the week visit."
36,"I first went to Street & Co. in 1992. What a delight of fine fusion dining!  Copper top tables back in the day. I fell in love with Portland in '92 and moved up from Boston in the spring of '94. 

In '94 Portland was pre-cell phone, internet and social media. Places like Brian Boru, Pepper Club and Katahdin rained supreme... and you'd wonder what deals, shows, and performing arts would be listed in The Casco Bay Weekly!

Scallops, pan seared. Polenta and asparagus. A lovely French table white. Thinking about the Christmas Tree lighting!  Walking home to York Street. The Scotia Prince coming in... the smells emanating from Becky's!  

Portland has changed since '94. Greatly. You can't go back in tome Gatsby."
37,"This was our favorite restaurant on our recent visit to Maine! We opted for the mussels as an appetizer, which went perfectly with the complimentary bread! Dip the bread into the amazing garlicy sauce for a tasty bite! 

For our entree, we decided on the clam linguine with white sauce. Although we enjoyed it, I would recommend trying something with a red or Alfredo sauce if you plan to get the mussels. The flavor profile of these two dishes is very similar, so it can get repetitive on the palate if you are looking to try different flavors! We loved our choices and didn't mind that both had a very similar sauce, but it can be helpful to keep this in mind when making a selection. You can't go wrong with anything here, the seafood is incredibly fresh and every single element is cooked to absolute perfection. 

We finished off with the strawberry rhubarb pie, which was to die for- we would go back just for this! 

Definitely make a reservation prior to coming to save on wait time!"
38,Food was awesome! They took our party earlier than expected. I liked their wine selection and their food was big enough to feed 2 people at least!
39,"Street & co is one of my favorites so far in Portland. If you're craving seafood go here. All the food (including the free bread) was great, and my favorite dish was the octopus appetizer. 

Seating can be tough to get so I would recommend calling ahead."
40,"This is a top tier restaurant in Old Port - According to a tourist. We've been visiting Portland for five years now and usually we try the same places - Duckfat and Eventide. Why mess with a good thing, right? Being in Portland for an extra day we decided to try Street and Co as they were dog friendly. 


First the staff was very friendly with our dog, she pretty much goes every where we go. The manager came out and said hello to our dog and the waitress ended up bringing us a big dish of water. 
The food was outstanding, I wanted to try the lobster but the specials sounded so good. I would give the food 4/5 honestly as it is really hard to get perfect food. This stands toe to toe with Eventide when it comes to seafood. 

Overall between their staff and the quality of food, we would def recommend coming in. We plan on visiting with my parents in the near future."
41,"The food and service were so prompt and on point. I sat at the bar and had access to the complete menu. I started with oysters, and each of them were great. I have discovered through restaurants like this that I truly like Maine Oysters. These were fresh and light. They were not full of brine or seawater flavor. For the entree, I had the scallops (the regular broiled version). They were in a nice light butter. I ate up the dish quickly. The potatoes were soft and seasoned well (a light seasoning). Since I wasn't overly hungry, these two items were the right amount for a meal. I also had the house bread, which was soft with a crunchy crust. I would recommend that you put this on your list of places to stop in when visiting Portland."
42,There is no reason to write out a long review when it can be summed up so quickly. SIMPLY DELICIOUS! The lobster fra diavolo was simply incredible and a must have. It is quite big so obviously you can share it but you might just want to eat the whole thing yourself. Great friendly staff and service to match the incredible food.
43,"My husband planned an incredible birthday weekend for me, filled with good seafood in Portland, ME.  It's hard to go wrong in this town because everything is so food-esque and chef-y but Street and Co. is definitely the best.  It's a good experience, with a lively atmosphere, open kitchen, friendly service. Prices are also decent for the portion of food you get... 

Of course we got the famed lobster diavolo ($60), and honestly it says it feeds two but you could probably fee 3 or 4. We're pigs so the server said we had ""above average consumption"" **sheepish** but honestly, all the elements were very tasty so it's hard to put down. You get: 

- A full lobster, which was fresh and well done. They crack some of it for you but you still have to do some work. The server was great about refilling our bowl for shells, etc. 
-Linguine pasta in a yummy spicy tomato sauce, arribata style 
-Tons and tons of fresh clams, mussels (meaty!), and calamari (the worst and the least)

A filling, delicious meal. 

We also tried some of the ""tastes"" which were craft little bites, creatively done. Among them, a cooked tuna dolma (stuffed grape leaf) with dirty rice - my fave. Halibut salad stuffed in a red piqullo pepper, and the Arctic Char type of deviled egg. Which was actually yummy considering I don't love deviled eggs. 

For drinks, my hubby had a local beer, and two cocktails - 1) the cocchi which was a bubbly processco type of refreshing cocktail, and 2) the Night Out which was a boozy martini type drink with savignon blanc. This was a pretty boozy cocktail. 

For dessert, we shared a light, airy Greek Yogurt Cake. It came with citrus notes, and pistachio. It's not everyone's cup of tea- quite light and perhaps tarte but I don't like really sweet desserts so it was perfect for me. They put a nice candle on it for me since it was my birthday and gave plenty of well wishes along the way. 

Food came out quickly; we had an 830 res and were seated nearly right away. The restaurant was clearing out by the time we left."
44,"Definitely the best meal we had in Portland. 

The environment is very nice and I was impressed with the wait staff. 

We started with the octopus appetizer. The octopus was nicely charred and the spices (mainly paprika) were good. We were slightly disappointed in the size of the dish as typically we get bigger portions when we order octopus. 

For dinner I got the lobster with linguine. The lobster was delicious as expected and the linguine was great but I thought it had too much garlic in it. Towards the end of it I was trying to get the last few strands of linguine and was just getting full scoops of chopped garlic. 

My wife got the scallops and they were incredible. Definitely agree with the other reviewers. Would highly recommend this. 

Overall, very nice dinner."
45,"Street & Co is a member of the family of restaurants that include Fore Street and Scales and after a great dinner at Fore we gave it a whirl.

Upon entering the joint I was immediately cramped... not just because of the amount of people (it's very popular) but also because of the low ceilings and crammed layout.  As we waited for our table we ordered drinks in the lounge area which did not have a bar, rather various low tables and peripheral seating against a wall.  Somehow we found a couple is chairs on the periphery while we sipped our drinks but it was hard to relax as I constantly had to re adjust to let others pass as their tables were ready.  When our table came up we were ushered to a twofer against a brick wall, which I actually welcomed since that meant that there would be no traffic to one side.  I know I'm harping on this as it should be about the food, but it's important to mention that if you are not in to continuous bustle and the related acoustic cacophony heightened by wood-beamed low ceilings this is not a good choice for dinner.  Romance will not be had here!  On several table passes, various diners kept bumping our roasting pans that housed are mains as the handles extended out a bit.  Ugh!!  But on to the food:

Our starters were good-- the octopus was tender enough and maybe under-spiced and I missed the crunchy char that is often a highlight of this dish.  The Manchego membrillo starter would have been better for dessert as the combo of the paste with a fig cake created a sweetness imbalance with the cheese.  My fault though, so no big deal.  The heirloom tomato salad was the best of the three as the produce was amazingly fresh and not eclipsed by an overbearing dressing.  Maybe the olives were house cured or so they seemed!

The whole fish Branzino came atop a braised kale and mushroom base with a balsamic broth that paired perfectly with the white flesh of the fish.  I'm not usually a fan of white flaky anything in the fish camp but they nailed this treatment on the flavor spectrum.  The shrimp came atop a scampi like ""white sauced"" linguini and it was expectedly rich, decadent and teeming with roasted garlic and julienned basil.  The shrimp was sadly a tad over-done which made it dense and a bit chewy instead of that ""pop"" one gets when it's cooked to perfection.  My wife and I both thought the sauce had some other element that made the dish denser like ground pine nuts etc.... when we asked our serve said it was just garlic that was roasted..... I'm still not buying it though as this dish is one of my own specialties and garlic doesn't get to that denseness unless toasted to a golden color.

We paired the meal with a 2013 Sancerre which was a great choice if I do say so myself!

And thus I'll end by saying that it was a decent meal, not spectacular, and the ambience was aggravating.  Oh and our clothes smelled of the place long after leaving.  Fore St was better on all levels.

Robbo, Parker, CO keeping it as honest as I can!"
46,"A great seafood meal and a really fun atmosphere!

Lobster and pasta, yum!"
47,"Amazing (I don't use that term frequently!) dinner tonight and terrific recommendations by Mark made for the best dinner of our trip to Portland! Started with the mussels... could've stopped there... so plentiful and the garlic butter sauce was so delicious I wanted to scrape the bowl! My hubby had the grilled lobster over linguini in garlic sauce and I had the scallops in Pernod & cream. OMG... so much food and incredibly delicious. We brought half of it home! We'll definitely be back if we make it back to Portland. Thank you, Mark, for your divine recommendations!"
48,"This place was good for dinner, but not great. My fiancee and I came here and ordered the lobster diavolo. It was a LOT of food; more food than the two of us could finish. And there was a lot of seafood for us to share, plus some decent pasta.

But it wasn't the best pasta or seafood that I ever had. It was good but not great. I would go back, but only to try the other dishes which I think would be better.

I think the lobster diavolo is a tourist trap; if you come here order something else unless you are really hungry."
49,"What a great place! We had an amazing dinner here, and the atmosphere was perfect. Fresh seafood, great service, very cool layout with an open kitchen. So amazing!"
50,"Such an incredible meal and dining experience. Good company, good wine and hands down one of the best seafood culinary experiences I've ever had. My table ordered what they're known for, the lobster diavolo and then we switched it up and went for the garlic lobster and the scallops in Pernod and cream. 
The scallops were incredible!!! The highlight of the meal. Creamy tender buttery amazingness. My mouth is watering for more already... and dare I say, better than the lobster diavolo?! Even though the lobster diavolo was soooo good. So pick what you're more in the mood for, marinara based spicy mussels, clams and lobster (very mild heat!) or creamy butter heaven 
And the appetizers were amazing too!!!! Baked octopus and calamari!"
51,"Had the lobster diavolo and shared it with my gf. I did not realize it was a pasta with noodles underneath.. The portion was huge and was worth the $60. It could of been shared between three people. Everything tastes phenomenal from the lobster to the mussels, clams, calamari, noodles, sauce, etc etc. Will go back on an empty stomach to get this again. 

The place itself is kind of small and was smokey when we first walked in, but reserving a seat was easy.. We walked in and chose 6:30pm which was about 25 mins Saturday night on cinco de mayo.. We walked around for a bit and came back to immediately be seated so wasn't bad at all.."
52,"The great and the bad.  
The great was the food and ambiance.  Excellent and I'd give it 5 stars.  
The bad, and I mean bad, was the blond hostess who just couldn't be more unpleasant and unwelcoming.  Completely lacking the ability to smile or get a greeting out of her mouth.  She acted as though she was doing everyone a huge favor to allow them to eat there.  

And it wasn't just us that she was unpleasant to, we were waiting to be seated when three other couples arrived for their reservation and she treated them like they were annoying her.  One of the couples actually asked us what her problem was!   I also saw her delivering some of the food to a few tables later on and she put them down on the tables as though it was beneath her to deliver food.  No smile, no words, just dropping the plates with a cold face and walking away. 

Maybe she was the owner's wife because it's impossible to understand any other circumstance which would put such a cold and unfriendly person in that position.  She's the first impression and trust me when I tell you, it's not a good one.
  
Normally I wouldn't bother mentioning a hostess, unless I had something great to say, and it pains me to reduce this rating to 3 stars because of one person but she really was a such an immediate and complete negative from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  

When we left, I said goodbye to her just to see if she would even respond at all.  She didn't.  

Anyway, the food was incredible.  Grilled octopus appetizer, tuna appetizer with oil and salt, freshly grilled halibut to perfection.  
I wanted to order their specialty, lobster fra diavolo which looked amazing but I was having some stomach issues so unfortunately, I decided against it.  

The ambiance and service were great.  

Make a reservation, enjoy the delicious food and be prepared to ignore the hostess and her ridiculously rude  holier than thou attitude."
53,"Lobster Diavolo!! I had this place bookmarked before my trip to Maine. After reading some reviews, I knew I had to go here to try their lobster diavolo pasta for two. We made a reservation for Monday dinner. The ambiance is upscale casual, and I really loved the cute decors that added to the cozy interior. Even the complimentary bread was very warm and chewy that I almost filled myself up with too much bread. When our food and drinks came out, I was initially surprised with their generous portion. The food came out relatively fast, and the service was excellent. Because of the season, the lobsters had hard shell as opposed to soft shell; so we had hard time trying to break open the shell. The waiter took the lobster inside and had it hammered it for us. Will revisit when we go to Maine."
54,"Not sure how the food is yet. We haven't eaten though we've been here for two hours. Still waiting.... not impressed. We've had a few beers and cocktails - which have been just ok.

Update: finally got our food! It was ok. I'm almost sad, as I had expectations that the food was going to be amazing and change my mind. The scallops were very tough and over done. 
So... long wait. Cocktails - eh. Food- ok. Service- also not great. Probably wouldn't come back."
55,"This place lives beyond the hype. 

I hate that I have to live in Shitcago. Why can't we have lobsters in Lake Michigan? Ugh. 

Well, bf and i were in Portland for the weekend (drove up from Boston, where he lives) and Street & Co. was our second stop. After filling myself with the big ass lobster roll at Bite Into Maine, I was scared that I may not be able to enjoy my dinner at S & Co. 

Wrong! The ginormous Lobster Diavolo (for ""2 ppl,"" but more for like 5) was so insanely good we both could not stop stuffing ourselves, because we both knew that if we stopped, we'd regret it.

If anyone is every in Portland, this place is a must!"
56,"I would back here in a heart beat! Places had a nice rustic decor, clean and friendly staff. We got the Lobster Diavolo which was fantastic. The lobster was so juicy and rich, there was mussels, clams, squid and octopus in the pasta underneath the lobster! It had a hint of spiciness to, which in my opinion really tied the dish! The dish was for 2, but could have feed maybe 3 or 4. 

The clams were amazing as well- wish the waitress told though that the lobster diavolo had other seafood. And that we were getting too much food. Regardless, the food was amazing! 

The crabmeat salad was to die for! The crab was so sweet and the avocado and sea beans really pulled out the sea-foodness!"
57,"This is my family's favorite restaurant in Portland, ME. Every time we come to visit family, we go here.

You should get a reservation at least a day before. You can also try and stop by the location and see how the wait is...at your own risk.

Come early before your reservation to get cocktails and some oysters at the bar area.

The menu is great, but there are two options that are spectacular...first is the sole francaise, which is sole sautéed is butter. It is melt in your mouth good! The second, and my favorite, are the scallops in pernod cream sauce. The scallops always cut like butter and the cream sauce is delicious, with a hint of anise flavor.

The atmosphere is cozy, with copper plated tables and herbs hanging from a low ceiling. 

Highly recommend! 


P.S. We once even saw Brad Paisley with his family here!"
58,"I went to on Sep 26th and ordered Lobster Diavolo for two ($68.95 )and Grilled Octopus ($18).Octopus was very tender delicious (a little pricey for the portion) but Lobster Diavolo,so disappointed.Mostly linguine and mussels with too salty garlic sauce .
I wouldn't recommend."
59,"This place is fantastic! My boyfriend and I came for a romantic dinner. We waited for a bit, but enjoyed an app and a drink while we waited. There was confusion regarding our seating, so they gave us our flatbread on the house! The staff was amazing and attentive. We had the mussels, scallops, and a flatbread and it was plenty of food."
60,"Note: a huge portion of this 5 star review is due to the heavy garlic usage in both dishes we had - I am garlic obsessed and would not recommend Street & Co. to anyone that is sensitive or has an aversion to garlic.

After reading rave Yelp reviews of the Lobster Diavolo, I knew that I had to come here for dinner. The stars aligned and when we walked in, two seats opened up at the bar and we were able to sit right down! The ambiance in the bar/lounge area is a bit different than the rest of the restaurant and I'd actually recommend the bar over the dining room if possible. The rest of the restaurant was crowded and the lighting was much brighter - whereas in the bar area, it felt much cozier. 

FOOD: 
We ordered the Mussels Provencal to start which were delicious. Big, juicy mussels with a garlicky broth - for $13.95 it was a huge portion that actually left us more full than anticipated. For our main course, we split the Lobster Diavolo which was unreal. The pictures are deceptive - my husband and I pride ourselves on being able to eat a lot (seafood in particular) and we were unable to finish this dish. Two lobster tails, clams, mussels, and calamari all on top of a huge serving of pasta. Again, very garlicky but oh so delicious. Perhaps if we hadn't started with a huge appetizer of mussels, we'd have been able to eat more of it. 

All in all, our experience here was fantastic. The amount of seafood you get for the price is absolutely unheard of in Boston. The value and garlic made it a 5 star win for me and I'll most definitely be trying to come back when I'm in Portland again!"
61,"We had the delicious garlic and lobster over linguine. This place is so charming. W got a bottle of our favorite Sauvignon Blanc too! The service was friendly and fast and we could see into the kitchen from our table! I am pretty sure they slaughtered two whole garlic bulbs for our pasta, garlic lovers paradise in the garlic dishes. Salad was fresh and perfectly balanced in flavor. Fresh bread out of this world."
62,"Finally  I managed to hit up this place at 2nd attempt!

My 1st attempt coming here was cancelled since there was 45 minute wait without reservation and I was too HANGRY to wait..haha

On my 2nd attempt, after learning from the 1st experience, I decided to make reservation to avoid similar outcome during one of my dinners. My friends and I who all were visiting from NY were seated immediately. I immediately noticed the open kitchen concept, where I was able to see how the food was prepared. The place smelled so good from all the butter/spices/aromatics that constantly came from the kitchen..mm hmm.

So we shared the lobster fra diavolo and scallop with cream sauce. And finished off the meal with Bourbon pecan pie a la mode. The scallop dish unfortunately for me was so so. I remembered it came with some kind of 
farro it somehow did not soak up the creamy flavor. The scallop was okay, a little much smaller in size and not many of it in the pan. Not sure it worth the price tag. The lobster fra diavolo meanwhile was awesome. It's got rich tomato based flavor sauce and loaded with seafood. Definitely sharable even for 3 people.  We even managed to still clean up the leftover sauce with bread. The A la mode pecan pie was perrrfect. Warm bourbon infused pie meets cold ice cream. Perfect ending to the meal.
All in all, a little pricey meal (but then everybody knows that vacation is NOT the time to save money) but it was a great experience.

Great place to eat for an out of town visitors! Or catch up with friends/ date. Remember: ALWAYS make reservation. Reservation seems to be the norm for restaurants in Portland generally otherwise be prepared to wait for a while! (READ: Eternity)

PS: Sorry I had a low battery therefore was unable to take pictures of the food! This review would have been more helpful with pictures.

PPS: Did you make reservation yet? You'll thank me later. You're welcome."
63,"I need to answer this 3 ways..
Ambiance wonderful, but note you will have a 2 day wait so call for reservations!
Food spectacular we shared the Lobster Diavolo, more then enough food more like for 3 not just 2. Lobster, clams, mussels, squid, calamari in a lightly spiced linguine.
Service....terrible. Now let me explain my cousin & I (2 women) went in so excited as we had to wait a day and a half for reservations. We were in such a great mood and then we got a waitress by the name of Erica....evidently she prefers to wait on tables with men. She came to our table 4x and the tables surrounding us twice and 3x as many times. I lost count when 1 of the tables got a visit from her 11x....really. I was sad that she ruined our experience. Go just don't sit at her table....and enjoy"
64,"Definitely worth the praise it gets on Yelp. The lobster diavolo was to die for. 
Every single employee there was wonderful and attentive. 
Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Portland.
Attached are the before and after pictures."
65,"I called to make a reservation for my mom and dad as it was my dads birthday and I had heard good things about Street & Co. I planned to pay for their meal and had it all arranged so they could have a wonderful night. Plain and simple from what I gathered, my parents waitress was NOT eager to accommodate, seemed bothered at any question and simply annoyed. Which I get, service industry sucks and people are annoying, I've been bartending and waitressing for 8 years, I get it. But when you're aware that a table is being payed for by someone and your 20% gratuity is already included and it's a special occasion, you'd think she'd make some kind of effort. I knew something was wrong when I checked my credit card and it was $23.97 when I had planned on at least $100 tab. 

Jay thank you for your eagerness to help and arrange payment, I appreciate your help but unfortunately it was a disappointing evening due to the staff yesterday evening."
66,"I came here on a Saturday night. We were seated outside. It was a bit cold, but still a pretty nice street nevertheless. We ordered the pea soup and grilled sardines for starters. They were both OK, nothing to write home about. 

For entree, we got the lobster linguini and scallop pan. The lobster linguini was nicely done with a whole lobster. The garlic butter sauce was delicious, especially after the lobster juice absorb into the noodles as you disassemble the lobster. The scallops were done perfectly with good portions. 

The service was top notch. Our server was friendly and nice. I will come again if I am in Portland."
67,"Favorite meal during our recent trip to Portland: The clam appetizer was the best thing we ate all weekend. The octopus and the scallops with farro were delicious as well. The atmosphere is cozy, welcoming and unpretentious and the service is great. We showed up at 7 on a Sunday night and were told to come back at 9 for our table, so it's possible to get in without a reservation."
68,"Came here early to make a reservation since the last time in Portland we were unable to get a table due to the wait times running us into the time when the restaurant closes. Worked out perfectly today! Had the Lobster Fra Diavlo (for 2), which was executed to perfection! Juicy lobster, plump clams and muscles, squid, on a bed of linguine. The portion is huge!! It could easily feed 3-4 people! Had dinner and left overs for the next day! Definitely will return to Portland to have this again! Weekend trip from Boston a success!"
69,"Sept 2018 - WOW! This place is amazing, the food and service was great.  There are plenty of tables, but call first before just showing up.   We sat at the bar, and our server could not have been any nicer.   Love the thick concrete slab counter top and the rustic feeling throughout the place and lighting.  Also the oysters on ice presentation at the bar was beautiful (they offered 3 different kin kinds of oysters).  We shared the Grilled Lobster on Linguine, butter and garlic - they cut the Lobster in half, but you had to do the rest of the work to get the meat out, the meal was delicious.   I forgot the bread they served had a crispy crust layer on the outside and soft inside, honestly I could just sit there and have a loaf of Bread and red wine and cad call it a night :) All and all, this is a must try restaurant."
70,"I visited Maine in July and this was my favorite restaurant out of all the ones I tried there. My friend, who lives in Maine, have wanted to try it for the longest time but there were always booked. We risked it and didn't make reservations. When we asked if they had a table for two, to our surprise they did! 

As for as I know, they have three rooms in restaurant: one is a bar, the middle is for walk-in customers, and the last room is for reservations. The bar is just a lounge area for drinks and maybe small snacks. The walk-in section and the reservation area looked the same except the open kitchen is part of walk-in section so all the smoke filled that room up. We didn't really mind.

We ordered the Lobster Diavolo. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS. The seafood was amazing and the pasta was cooked well. I am so glad my friend brought me here. It will feed around two to three people. I highly recommend this dish!"
71,"Great dinner for our party of 6 this week. I love how our server, Benji, was knowledgeable about the entire food and beverage menu and provided great service. The octopus appetizer was cooked perfectly, and the table enjoyed the manchego too.  Entrees were hearty portions and very tasty. All were prepared as expected except the temperature of the char was a little too cool for just prepared. The pumpkin flan was an autumn treat for our group from Miami. We enjoyed this dinner very much and would definitely return while in Portland again."
72,Came to Portland for the weekend and this was on top of my to-do-list. We couldn't book a reservation since it was all filled up so we went to the restaurant at 5pm and waited to put our names down. Luckily we were able to be seated for the 5:30 sitting. We had the oyster and the lobster diavolo for two. Both were excellent and the lobster diavolo was huge! Could easily feed three people. The clams and mussels were plentiful and the pasta was flavorful from the broth. Definitely recommend to try and come here if you are in Portland! :)
73,"After doing a quick Yelp search, I knew I had to go here. The ambiance was very cute and cozy, and the staff was very friendly. Kudos to the hostess for managing the floor while keeping waiting guests happy. 

I'm sure in the summertime the restaurant is ridiculously packed, but for a Saturday night in January there was still a short, but reasonable wait. We grabbed a drink in the waiting area and were seated (without a reservation) within 15 minutes of arriving. 

For anyone who's on a date with your significant other or friends, the lobster diavolo is the way to go. This dish is easily shareable among three people (though my boyfriend and I were ambitious in trying to finish it and couldn't). It was absolutely delicious and flavorful (if you love garlic, this is an added plus), jam-packed with various types of seafood and enormous lobster claws on top. There was so much pasta, we didn't know what to do with ourselves! 

We ordered calamari and paired it with their complimentary bread to indulge in the yummy sauce, but we probably could've done with out it all and saved our appetite for the main course.

Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience and will be coming back for more during our next visit."
74,"I cannot recommend this place enough. If you are in Portland- you need to eat dinner at this establishment at least once. However, do follow the other yelpers advice. Make a reservation otherwise you will be waiting for 2.5 hours at least to eat. That's the only downfall of this restaurant, but I guess waiting is a virtue, right? I tried to come here for the second time, however, I was an idiot and I didn't make a reservation. I'm not going to drive all the way up here from Boston to wait that long- but I digress.

The first time I came here I ordered scallops. They were absolutely incredible. Soft, buttery, clean (no sand). Would def. order again. The person I was with ordered the muscles. They were also incredible! Best pasta dish I've ever tried in my life and this is coming from someone who frequents the North End. Oysters are fresh and tasty- wine list is also amazing."
75,"I've been here many times and always feel very happy with their food, services, decoration and etc. All of them fulfill my dinner with family. Every times since I've been eaten here never disappointed. And it's very worth to drive 2hrs for dinner. Cheers!!!"
76,"I was impressed with this restaurant and the food offerings. In my opinion it's better than Eventide... 

Street & Co knows how to cook seafood... and they cook it well. This was our second favorite (Bite of Maine our first). Make sure you make reservations as it usually gets filled up fast. We got lucky and got a cancellation. 

We ordered the octopus, seafood diavolo, and the scallops in the pan. Everything was delicious!! The scallops were perfectly seared in the pan with mushrooms and broccoli... I can still taste it! The seafood diavolo was everything I hoped for. The seafood fresh and savory. The pasta was a good filler. 

I'm in love with Street & Co! I wish seafood was this good in the west coast. But then I'll be fat from eating too much..."
77,"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Maine.  Having come here each time I've visited Portland, it never fails to provide a great dish of Lobster Fra Divalo for two.

Now over the years this dish has changed a little and the costs have gone up.  Almost double I believe but the dish itself is still
fabulous and worth the effort still for sure.

There are two great appetizers on the menu that are perfect for dipping the fantastic artisan bread that will accompany your meal.  The Mussels and the Clams are buttery awesome. The Musclan salad with chunks of goat cheese and roasted pistachio nuts are deliciously patted with greens.

I've never gotten dessert here as I've always been so full from dinner to try anything else.  If Lobster Fra Diavolo is on your menu for dinner, one shouldn't budget for anything else!"
78,"Got the ever famous lobster diavolo and it was worth it. Lots of flavor (garlic, tomato, and then of course all the seafood). It was perfect serving for 2 and tons of leftover linguine. The staff is okay, they all seemed very busy and don't provide a whole of info on anything other than the specials. It's a little pricey but worth at least to try once."
79,"Check inn and bar service very good 
But not a great service in restaurant dinner 
I hope any you one and up with server like  
I did  

Sunny"
80,"NOT NICE FOR WHAT? 
I thought we were past people discriminating on an interracial couple. Morgan M however is not; terrible service. Wouldn't check on us or food; she even put the food order in late took forever for the food to be served luckily we were not in a rush and enjoying each other's company. I've worked in a kitchen and restaurant business long enough to know she should have updated us on the food. "" i just checked on your food it will be another few minutes"" goes a LONG WAY, but obviously she didn't. I'm glad the food came out hot because Morgan was cold as ice. 
The positives; host and bussers were awesome and friendly. Food was amazing as well; it's too bad Morgan ruined what should've been a great experience. I should've not tipped and made a scene but that's not what it's all about."
81,"This is a local favorite and an amazing restaurant. The service is always good and the food never disappoints. 
Best to make a reservation as it's always fought to get a table. If your a walk in, get there early."
82,"Came here last night and had an amazing dinner experience.  Loved the food, ambience, and service. We had lobster diavolo and calamari white sauce linguine. Wow! The best seafood I had in my life! I normally dislike mussels but they cooked it so perfectly, just enough, and they were monstrous in size. The lobster was delicious! What made it so good was the abundance of garlic in the sauce. The pasta, seafood and the sauce just complimented each other. The calamari was fresh and so good too! Even the bread and butter they serve before your meal was delicious and of good quality.  I really wouldn't mind coming here every day during our stay in Portland! It's a must try if you are in the area."
83,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! my honey and I were here on vacation and this place was recommended over and over again by locals. Luckily we scored a last minute reservation. The food was amazing. We got a huge dish that we split it seems it brought every seafood item on the menu. The waitress was super nice and the food sublime! Highly recommend. The lobster was amazing! The pasta! The shrimp! All of it!!! Our waitress was very friendly and she did a great job of recommended some items on the menu.
84,"Was recommended to eat here by 2 colleagues and it lived up to high expectations.  Play it safe and make a recommendation, especially if you are going at peak dinner time during tourist season.  Open for dinner only.  

Awesome food - my husband enjoyed oysters and lobster, and I enjoyed tasty vegetarian soup and salad (pasta primavera was also available for a larger vegetarian entree).  

Service was solid and ambiance (on old cobbled street near the bay) was cozy."
85,"Just insanely good. The atmosphere, the wine, the food, the people that work there. Don't visit Portland without coming here. Order a bottle of Pieropan Soave with the Lobster Diavolo. That is all you need to know!"
86,"The Lobster dish with pasta was absolutely one of the best
Meals that I've eaten in many a day!!! The service was great also! Our visits to Maine was great!!!"
87,"Well worth the 1.5 hour wait on a busy Saturday night. We came without reservation late in the evening around 8pm and were seated at 9:30pm. It was nice to walk outside but also came back and they have probably the nicest waiting area/lounge I've been to. There's a table as well as couches and coffee tables which you can order food and drinks. Service was friendly and you can close the tab with your appetizer / drink before getting seated.

1. Oysters - 1 of each that night which was great. Tasted fresh, flavorful and at $3 a piece was average price

2. The Night Out (cocktail) - 4.5/5. Delicious! Great mix of alcohol and fruit.

3. Lobster Diablo for two - 4.6/5. So good as well and they give you a bunch of seafood (clams, giant oysters, calamari) on top of a big lobster and a bunch of linguini. We took part of this home and this fed us the next day as well. Lobster was very fresh tasting and the sauce itself had some spice to it. Be careful if you wear light colored clothes since the sauce can splash.

Overall, we had an awesome time here and highly recommend it for anyone going to Portland for a day or two or on the regular, it doesn't matter!"
88,"We had an excellent meal. The smells were mouthwatering and the tuna was done to perfection. 

We split the lobster bread pudding and it was well worth it. There was a taste selection of a flounder pate that met our expectations. 

Next time I will be trying the grilled octopus."
89,"We chose this restaurant randomly and we were not disappointed. The meal was fantastic. We had the mussels as an appetizer. They were fabulous and the broth was killer. We had the scallops Pernod which were amazing. The blueberry pie a la mode for dessert was a fantastic end to a memorable meal. 
I would highly recommend the restaurant without reservation."
90,"We stopped here for a bite to eat. Cool vibe inside with a great bar area with couches and chairs and a separate dining area. My husband and I chose to sit at the bar for dinner. We were greeted by a women who waited on us part of the time with some younger guys, too, that were working behind the bar. We had a bottle of Pinot noir and shared tastes and small plates. Since my husband doesn't do oysters, I had a half dozen myself. They were served with a mignonette. The oysters served were on the smaller side. I like horseradish or Tabasco with my oysters and neither came with or were offered. The three tastes we had were the goat cheese with pea purée & cracker; manchego with fig cake; and crispy jamon with fiddleheads. All were just a taste, really not a shareable dish. So taste means just that - a bite. This is not a complaint but more informative for you to make your ordering decisions. The goat cheese and that pea purée was just delicious. It was surprisingly not a soft goat cheese. The fig cake served with the manchego was the bomb...we loved it!  The manchego was easily shared as there were a few pieces of cheese. The crispy jamon was very crispy. It was so small that it really was just enough for one person to pop in their mouth. The accompanying fiddleheads were so dressed with vinegar that I choked upon tasting them. Next we ordered the mussels and the calamari appetizers. Both were so good! The mussels were large in size and plentiful. The flavorful broth was sopped up with crusty bread...yum. The calamari came in a tomato sauce. This also was a good-sized portion and tasty. Both fish dishes were plenty to share between the two of us. Overall, we really enjoyed our dining experience. Usually, servers are more interactive and friendlier than what I encountered here, so I took away a star for the lackluster service of those working the bar area."
91,"My mom and aunt were visiting for the weekend and we came here on a Friday night. We put our names in at 7:30 and were able to get a table at 8:30. Luckily theirs plenty of places to wait nearby so we headed to Mash Tun while we waited. I wanted to love this place, but I can't say I'll be back soon. I love the atmosphere and the menu is great, but I wasn't a huge fan of my meal. I had the mussels marinara and i think it was just too garlicky for my taste. It was really pungent. The mussels appetizer had a lot of garlic too, but it worked somehow. I also felt like it took a long time for our food to come out. I watched another couple come in and sit and eat and leave all before we got our main course. My mom and aunt split the halibut and loved it. Next time I'll have to try something different."
92,"This without a doubt is the best Restaurant in Portland, Maine with an amazing menu with a great variety of dishes to choice from. Their bread is absolutely delicious and the Lobster Diavolo (For Two) is one of my wife and I favorite and one of our favorite appetizer is Mussels Provencal with Garlic,
White Wine and Butter.
This is an absolute must to eat at if you are visiting the Portland area or if you are a local and have not visited this restaurant you are robbing your taste buds."
93,"Truly loved my meal--sea bass over lentils. Excellent ambience, awesome drinks, great company while on vacation made for a superb dining experience. Can't wait to return one day!"
94,"The atmosphere here is very homey and cozy despite how crowded it was, the decor, lighting and open kitchen make it feel like going to dinner at a friend's house. A fancy friend. The food was fantastic, I got the shrimp with garlic and butter sauce and it was everything I wanted! So flavorful, and the shrimp were a very decent size. Huge portions and perfectly flavored. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and the service was also fast. This was by far the best meal I had during my stay in Maine, can't wait to come back!"
95,"Regarding Starters, we highly recommend the flatbread with eggplant sauce and Spanish tortilla! We also like the grilled octopus and claims pasta! The best seafood restaurant in Maine!"
96,"We went here twice in two days for dinner because it was so good! Excellent service, soup, salads, fish and dessert! Would recommend to anyone in the area!"
97,this was the best dinner I had in Portland. The restaurant is on a small side street and the inside is so cute and has a great ambiance.  The menu is great and there are many delicious seafood options.  The lobster diavolo (for two) is a very generous portion and the lobster was excellent and the mussels were the best mussels I have ever had.  They also have excellent calamari and octopus.  Our server (Russian female) was excellent and had a very nice manner.  I would highly recommend Street & Co.
98,"Atmosphere: We were dining in the waiting area across from the exposed kitchen. We happen to like the chaos and watching the chefs at work, but if you are looking for something quieter, I would opt for the separate dining room. It did get a little smoky as well, but we didn't mind. 

Service: Lady was very professional, friendly, and courteous. No complaints there. 

Food: The bread is great. Made down the street at a local baking company, and is provided w/ copious amounts of butter, as well as salt and pepper for you to garnish as you wish. Put it all together and I nearly spoiled my dinner! Also had oysters, and the sole francais, which literally melted in your mouth. 4 stars only because it is on the priceier end, and the food was very good, but not out of this world. Had a great evening nonetheless."
99,"My wife and I went here for dinner our first night in Maine.  What a way to kick things off!  Got some cold water oysters, the lobster diavolo, and a bottle of wine.  Meal from top to bottom was incredible, and quite possibly the best meal we had over our 7 days on the ME coast.  Service was spot on as well.  

Do yourself a favor, and go to this place if you can!"
100,"Love this place!  Can't wait to get back to Maine for many reasons, but this is towards the top of that list. 

Great service, great food. Awesome beer. Love it!"
101,"Eventide oyster company is a pretty cute shop in Portland, Maine. It's only a bit of a walk from the harbor and has a nice ambiance and vibe, draft micro brewed beers and delicious oysters from around the area. This isn't the place for large groups though, there isn't much seating and it's a great date night spot if you are in Portland. 

Food: we got a dozen oysters and it ran us about $30, so even though it is an oyster shop, expect to drop a lot for some bivalves. The oysters were all super fresh and some of the best I've ever had. They come with your choice of either flavored ice or different sauces. 

Fried Pollock: This was DELICIOUS. I would definitely get again, the fish is super fresh and the batter was flavorful, crispy and light. It reminded me of eating fish and chips in Iceland. This is definitely worth it. 

Blackened Cod: This was super tiny, maybe an ounce of cod for $16-18. It had a fantastic presentation but you're stomach growls louder than your eyes. 

Service: Our waitress was good and attentive. Good service. 

Overall: Eventide Ouster Company is a fantastic place to eat in Portland. The menu is pricey, especially the oysters but it is like this in the entire area. The fried Pollock is the best I've ever had and I would totally get it again the next time I'm in Portland."
102,"This was an exceptional dining experience and the food and service was both very good.
We found out the server we had has also lived in the other part of the country where we are which was really cool. He gave us a lot of tips on other places to see and dine at while in the area and was exceptional.
Lobster roll is a must as well as the New England clam bake. Another great choice.
Happy hour - get the fish and chips 
Cocktails also were really good. 
Tip: small seating space so expect a wait or plan to be comfortable joining someone else at a communal table but hey! We ended up sitting next to a couple from our same area too. What's the chance. Great place"
103,"tl;dr

Interesting seafood restaurant, however might be overhyped.

---

Eventide is one of the great seafood establishments in Portland (now with even outposts in Boston!) so we knew we had to stop by on our way back from Acadia. 

The wait was pretty crazy as we were quoted a wait of about an hour for a party of 2 on a Sunday evening at 6 PM. 

We ordered a large sampling of their main offerings -- here's what we thought:

1. Their oysters are served very creatively here with flavored ice as the accouterments - we tried the horseradish and red onion ices, and I like how the ices add a crisp pop of flavor to the oyster without weighing it down. I have never seen this before elsewhere and it's a great idea.

2. The lobster stew, while interesting, was much too salty. Would have probably just enjoyed a standard lobster bisque rather than this creative approach.

3. The buns/rolls here are served on the equivalent of Chinese steamed baos, which is a very interesting take on the classic lobster roll. In general, I did think the baos work pretty well in this setting, as it's fluffier and lighter compared to bread. The toppings themselves though were nothing special to write home about. 

4. We also ordered a seasonal scallop ""okonomiyaki"" which is their take on the Japanese savory pancake, and this was a huge flop. They probably should have taste-tasted this a bit more rigorously but every single element of this dish was salty, which, when combined, simply made for a salty mess.

Overall, we had a decent meal. Although everything was generally adequate, nothing really stood out on its own. When passing through Portland again next time, I would probably think twice about stopping in here again -- especially with waits up to an hour!"
104,We got the Chuck oysters which tasted fresh and not dirty. The butter lobster was perfectly delicious and fresh. Service was good and it pricy but worth every penny.
105,"I'm torn about Eventide.  Yes, it was interesting, but I just did not enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I was going to.

The best part of this meal were the oysters.  They have many varieties of Maine oysters and also some from other parts of North America.  The best part was that you get to choose two accoutrements and many of the choices are actually ice.  So essentially you can top your oyster with a flavored shaved ice, which gives the oyster a really nice burst of flavor.  I went with the red onion ice and the horseradish ice, both of which were great.  The oysters were well shucked and seemed fresh.  As an oyster bar, Eventide gets full marks.

Unfortunately the rest of the meal gradually became less and less successful.  The well-touted lobster roll with browned butter was decent, but not worth the $15 price.  They use a house-made Asian bao sort of bread shaped into a lobster roll form.  And there's lobster on top.  It was okay.  The lobster seemed a bit chewy to me and it was messy to eat since the lobster isn't really sandwiched inside the roll, so it starts to fall off the bun as you eat.  The bao bread also robbed the lobster roll of some much needed crunch and was just soft.

The New England clam bake is visually appealing, but was one of the few things I ate this trip that I would not order again.  Part of the problem was that the steamers were SO SO gritty.  Yes, I do understand there is no way to rid the steamers of grit and sand, but I have never seen so much grit in a steamer before.  By the end of the meal, my napkin looked like I had dragged it through the beach and my hands were covered in dirt.  No, it wasn't just a little bit.  I was literally wiping caked on dirt for each steamer.  The mussels were okay, although some of the smaller ones became overcooked.  I did enjoy the hard boiled egg and the salt pork.  Now the big problem.  The lobster tail, the crown jewel of Maine, was completely overcooked.  It was difficult to remove from the shell and was just rubbery.  Maybe it's difficult to time all these items to steam together.  Maybe the lobster tail needs to be added partway through the steaming.  I had saved the lobster tail for the end and it was an unfortunate last few bites.  I was going to give Eventide three stars, but finally dropped them to two stars because the lobster was so overcooked.

I'm also not the biggest fan of the vibe here.  It seems very cold and sterile.  Yes, part of it is that it's a raw bar and yes, I did get shaved ice to top my oyster.  But everything from the service to the decorations to the food just seemed cold.  This is a stark contrast to my dinner the night before at Central Provisions where I felt so cared for and the food was so heartfelt."
106,"Ordered: clam chowder and lobster roll
Good portions decent price. No wait time. Open late even on Sundays. Nice location great decor and atmosphere. Absolutely loved the lobster roll! I could eat 3more of those! We tried one of each dessert they had on the menu as well and the pie a la mode was my favorite. Would definitely come back here if I'm in town again!!"
107,"Came here on our first night in Portland last June and it was a great experience. The place was packed, but we found a spot to stand and enjoy a cocktail or two before our table was ready.  We also ordered oysters as an appetizer. 

I was excited to taste the lobster stew and it was good but not my favorite.  Their take on the lobster roll is definitely unique."
108,"Everyone says you gotta try Eventide. So I did. It was good. I came for lunch on a weekday and had no problem being seated at the bar. 

Service was quick and good. But what do I know? It feels unfair to judge a place that's noted for being slammed based on a time when I'm one of three customers. Service had better be good when it's that empty. (It filled while I was eating.)

They have a lot of non-alcoholic drinks. (I like options!) I was there for lunch and going back to work so I opted for a light non-sweetened lemon soda on ice. It was perfect with the food, celebratory without being dulling. They served it with a paper straw. Yay environment!

Food. I had to get the brown butter lobster roll ($15). It's not at all a traditional lobster roll. Instead, they toss lobster in brown butter with sage and put it on a bao bun. The one I ate (with a knife and fork -- there seems to be no other way) was delicious. The bun was warm, as though they'd cooked it to order. The lobster was good. Would I eat it again? Sure. Am I craving it? No. Will I try it at home? Perhaps.

I also got a half-dozen oysters ($16) (3 different kinds) with shaved horseradish. They were clean and very cold (which I guess keeps them fresh but it's not my preference -- I like to taste them. I feel like the cold mutes the taste). They were full of brine and perfectly shucked. I could have eaten more but didn't need to. I was full. So, yay, food! 

Atmosphere is chilly -- metaphorically, not actually. The bar is cement, the stools are backless, and as at least one other reviewer said, it feels a little tight. Thankfully there was no one beside me. It's beautiful, sure, and these are little dings for a place that is consistently good and was for my visit. I'd like to try more of their menu. I'll be back."
109,"Nice place to grab a bite at the bar and for sure stop in if you like oysters! This brightly light little cafe was very inviting and we were seated immediately on high top chairs by the window. They're known for their oysters but they had plenty of other unique menu items such as sandwiches and seafood dishes. 

We were in between meals so me and my friend just ordered a dozen oysters of whatever our waitress chose. She was quirky and nice. You can see the oysters right at the display at the bar. I also loved that our platter came with a little sheet listing exactly what types we were eating. They also have a wide variety of sauces to dip in. I got the red wine mignonette and my friend got the black pepper ice. I adored mine. The oysters were super fresh and didn't have shells or sand in them at all. I think my favorite were the winterpoint selects. It was clean, refreshing and briny. Our server let me know beforehand that traditionally these northern oysters are more on the briny meaty side. They were great despite me preferring them to be more on the sweet side. I highly recommend stopping in!"
110,"We knew that there would be a long wait which was fine it is understandable so we waited 1.5 hours but what got us really salty after waiting almost 2 hours since the table they assigned to us those people didn't leave after paying but just decided to sit around playing on their phones for another 30 minutes. 

The cherry on top was as we sat down and FINALLY ready to order they said their out of the New England Clam Bake which was the only reason why we decided to wait that long.

Why weren't we told when putting the name on the list? Or when we were handed menus to look while we waited another 30 minutes before actually being seats.

We all got the New England Clam Chowder and the general consensus was it was bland, too much potato, and underwhelming. The mussel dish only had seven pieces and tons of potatoes though. The special boiled black cod was drowning in overly salted miso sauce which made you drink tons of water afterwards.

The ambience is very loud and your pretty much yelling at your waiters and friends because the music is blasting, and the seating is strange and uncomfortable.

Maybe it's who they have staffed during the winter that this experience was so horrible but that being said in the current state, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
111,"This restaurant has an interesting menu of seafood tapas with an Asian twist. We started off the meal with the lobster roll. Even though I knew it was tapas style, I was still a little disappointed by how small the dish was. It was such a tease when it was all gone in two bites.

The clam chowder was also interesting as it had a seaweed flavor to it. It had your standard clams and potatoes but the nice surprise were the bacon bits hidden inside. The strange thing was the soup was watery thin. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was unexpected as I thought I would get a nice thick chowder to slurp on. 

We also got the beet salad which I would come back for. It was drizzled with Szechuan chili oil, which was unique and somehow just worked very well with the sweetness of the beets. Honestly just a genius idea!"
112,"Finally checked this place out. You can't make reservations or call ahead. If you try to call their message says ""we won't tell you how long the wait is if you call"". Restaurant is very small.

We went early on a Saturday night to put our name in. They take your phone number. There's a wait list you can click when they text you so you can see what number you are. There's plenty of places close by to grab a drink.

Food. Brown butter lobster roll. Just get it. It's small, but delicious. $15. Not your traditional New England lobster roll. The crab roll was also very good. Came on the same bun as the lobster roll, again very small. The clam bake was also great. I think it was like $34 and came with mussels, steamers (clams), piece of pork belly and some potatoes. Flavor was great. We also got the cod cheek special which was tempura fried. The fish itself was so flavorful. The lobster bisque was again not traditional. Had a smoky flavor. I honestly didn't love it. I would probably skip it. The smoked char dip was good and came with homemade crackers. The last course we did was patata bravas. Honestly this one was a miss for us. It just was not well balanced and there was huge globe of salt in it.

Overall, place was great. Few misses, but the dishes that were good were very good. Check it out for sure. Put your name on the list and then go walk around old port."
113,"My friends and I drove to Portland from Boston and this place definitely didn't disappoint at all! If I could give a 10 stars, I would. We waited for almost an hour so we tried out Duckfat as we wait. (True foodies here).

Ambiance:  We were seated outside since there it was crowded inside. Outside was very nice and chill since we went during fall.

Customer Service: The server was patience as we asked me many questions and being a bit indecisive. He explained which oysters is which. Overall, I am happy with the service.

Food: Oh my gosh!! I have tried oysters from coast to coast and I have to say this restaurant serves one of the best oysters I ever had! You can literally smell the Atlantic Ocean from those oysters! I dream about it everyday! Their brown butter lobster roll was so buttery and soft! It's one of the best lobster roll I ever had. Trust me, I have tried lobster roll from Boston, San Diego, Toronto, and Seattle and it doesn't match up to the one here."
114,"Ventured into this wonderful place from all the way from New York and I gotta say that it was well worth it!! Finally came to see what the hype was all about when it came to the seafood in Portland. It is one of the best tasting and fresh seafood I have ever tried! 

We got the lobster roll, the lobster stew and the raw oysters. The lobster was amazing. There was no fishy smell to any of the dishes. I usually am not good at eating oysters due to the smell but somethings different about this place. 
The lobster roll was a little small but they emphasize quality over quantity. 
The raw oysters were so fresh that we couldn't get enough. 
The stew was a nice warm, hardy finish to the meal. 


Would definitely come back for the food and the great, lively atmosphere."
115,"Okay so this place is definitely worth the hype. Sometimes you have that strange seafood craving during the winter, thankfully we live in New England and can literally drive an hour and find pretty decent seafood. I went with a friend and of course Yelped some awesome seafood places and this was one of the top places! The line is crazy long and we waited maybe an hour but so worth it! They also allow you to order drinks inside while you wait which is nice. We ordered a half dozen oysters which were super fresh, they literally claw open the shells right in front of you! I ordered the lobster roll which is a must, don't get me started on the amazing melted butter drizzled over the fresh lobster, literally melts in your mouth."
116,"Neat place. Kind of small, no real atmosphere. Oysters were very good. Food is fresh, small portions, and a bit on the expense side.
We tried some of their drinks. The walking dead was strong, but served in a ceramic parrott....

It's worth a visit, once."
117,"Def the highlight of my Portland trip. 
I like the tuna crudo and oyster shot the most!!  They made the tuna crudo with green onion, soy sauce, and sesame oil, asian fusion like style. And the oyster was very fresh and tasty. 
The lobster roll is a little pricy since the portion is small. 
And be prepared to wait for at least 40 mins if you're coming at meal time. But it's really worth the wait."
118,"When I had a friend visiting from the Midwest looking for great seafood I knew we had to come to Eventide. 

We stopped in on a Friday night and right when you walk in you see the awesome oyster haul for the day on ice. We were quickly seated at the bar and started with Negroni Bianco cocktails which were lovely. 

The brown butter lobster rolls were out of this world, the bun was so soft and the flavor is so unique. 

Would highly recommend this!"
119,"Eventide is as good as it gets! There are plenty of lobster rolls to choose from in Portland, ME. My favorite part of Eventide's take on the lobster roll is that it is served on a brown-butter bread that melts in your mouth. Be warned, Eventide is more of a TAPAS style restaurant. Be prepared to purchase more than the lobster roll to fill you up. 

My next favorite dish on the menu is anything carpaccio!"
120,"A local landmark
Eventide is solid! There menu changes constantly to what is in season and fresh. The oysters we ate here were the best I have ever eaten! If you want micro terroir, of the ME coast come here! We also ate a Chirashi bowl, which was delicious. On a side note they have tiki drinks in the fun faced vase receptacles, which were better than many Asian restaurant offerings. It gets very busy here during prime times, expect a wait. I am not sure if they take reservations. We ended up coming back around 9 PM and it was a joyful and relaxing dining/slurping experience."
121,"This place came highly recommended and it did not disappoint! Delicious, unique seafood and happy, helpful employees. I would definitely come back here. Portions are a little smaller, so plan to order several things-- because of this, I would say expect to spend more than $30 per person. It's worth it-- but nice to know what to expect. Very happy with our stop here."
122,"A few friends and I drove from Boston to explore Portland, and it was here that I had possibly one of the best meals of the year. It alone made the drive worth it.

We got a tray of oysters to share. You can choose the type of flavored ice to pair it with, which was great. I recommend the purple one - I think it's onion? It was a little sweet and very refreshing.

I also got the clam chowder, lobster roll and tuna tartare. All were absolutely delightful. The clam chowder isn't thick like it normally is in New England, but I like this soupy texture better. It was so flavorful - the seaweed added a unique kick that I loved. It comes with these amazing crackers that I really wanted to know where they got it from. I could eat it all day. The lobster roll was buttery soft. The bun almost melts in your mouth, and the lobster filling was so rich it overwhelmed my taste buds and had me relishing every bite. The tuna tartare too was very fresh, not overly dressed/seasoned, so the flavor of the tuna came through wonderfully strong.

I woukd make the trip again just to eat here. Highly recommend!"
123,"One of the best seafood restaurants in New England. Very fresh raw oysters. Must haves include their lobster roll and Maine lobster stew, both very umami."
124,"I came on a Saturday afternoon with a group of four. We had heard really good things so we were ready for the hour wait. It was definitely worth it!

I tried 3 dishes-the Maine lobster stew, the eventide brown butter lobster roll, and the scallop waffle-yaki-as well as a handful of oysters. 

The lobster stew was delicious. It's very salty and buttery, and has a heap of lobster in it. The saltines that come with the soup are also really satisfying. The lobster roll was great as well, very soft with really fresh tasting lobster. The scallop waffle-yaki was kinda strange. It tasted fine, very much like takoyaki, but was just kinda a weird thing to eat. It's greasy and messy. It's the only thing that I might say pass on.

The oysters (pine point, John's River, and Harraseeket) were all very nice and clean. My personal favorite were the John's River. 

Overall we had a wonderful time. It's a bit cramped, and the wait was long, but it was worth it! The food was delicious and the service was efficient."
125,"Best. Clam. Chowder. This was my favorite place to have chowder in Portland. I don't know what it was about this place but it just really hit home. It is not a traditional clam chowder though. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was kind of surprised when it came out because it had some green oils in it... but wow! Everything in there complemented each other. From the clams to the potatoes to the seaweed. I just loved it. We came back three times in the five days we were there. 

Raw bar- fresh fresh fresh! there were so many options for us to choose from. I seriously wanted to try one of everything because all of the food was so fresh. I have never had oysters this fresh. In California, we get a lot of them imported, so I was ecstatic when I could eat it fresh from Maine. Yes, I know it seems silly. 

I do have a bone to pick with the lobster roll though. I am not docking a star because it still tasted amazing. The lobster roll was ridiculously small.  I am comparing it to the other lobster rolls in the area that are practically vomiting lobster out of the bread. The roll at Eventide is mostly bread with a couple pieces of lobster stuffed in it. For the price I was paying, I would have rather gone to Bite Into Maine.

Fried oysters were also delicious! Portions were extremely tiny, but it was good. 

Overall, I loved this little store. I will definitely be returning here if I ever go to Portland Maine again. I could use a hot bowl of chowder and raw oysters right about now."
126,"If you're reading this review, you're most likely a foodie. The highest rated restaurant in Portland has to be a stop and at over 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars, Eventide has some work to do. As a foodie, I strongly believe 3 elements make a dining experience great. Food, decor, and service.

Decor: kind of cozy. There's a nice open seafood bar right when you walk in and you can see all the chefs shucking oysters.

The food: everything was delicious here, I'm not gonna lie. The oysters were super fresh and the shells clean. These may have been the best oysters I've ever had. The lobster roll was super tasty too. It was buttered and just the right amount of crispy. The lobster bisque had some good chunks of lobster. The swordfish was heavenly, it melted right on the tongue. l wanted to give this place 5 stars just for the food but service.

The service: we had to wait a good amount (40min) for a saturday night. It would be longer but we opted for the standing shelf seats near the bathroom. Getting our order in was no problem. We received our oysters and here's where things went south. As people entered and left, we did not receive our order for over an hour even though we saw our waitress and she assured us it was coming out. Finally we hailed down another waiter and after asking him, it appeared our order never got put through even though we ordered the oysters and main courses at the same time. The waiter was nice enough to comp us some dill chips and a slice of moose pie but our dinner took 3 hours and we drove all the way up to Maine and had only 2 days. So our night was done after dinner. 

What a disappointment. 

Anywho, I'd give eventide a try again if I do visit Maine next time."
127,"Great salmon and mussels. Don't miss out on this place. Ambiance was great, nice place to take a date"
128,"How popular is this place?  Well, we waited 40 minutes mid-afternoon in the off season!  Wow!  Was it worth the wait?  Absolutely.

The Maine lobster soup was crazy good!  Can't recommend it enough.  Also, those brown butter lobster rolls are legit; decadent to say the least.

The service was excellent the entire time.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"
129,Delicious oysters - we just asked for the best/freshest and the waitress picked for us. Did not disappoint. Our kids enjoyed the burger. The fried fish with a side of fries was outstanding.
130,"Eventide is one of those staple restaurants in Portland. When tourists are in town, Eventide is one of those prominent establishments that people flock to for lunch and dinner, on any given day of the week. As you pass by the restaurant at all hours, there is always a distinguished line out the door waiting to get their hands on an Eventide bite.

I ended up coming to Eventide for the first time on a Wednesday evening. After living in Portland for about a year, I figured I eventually would have to try out Eventide myself and check out the hype. The typical line out the door to put in your name was still prevalent, and my friends and I waited for about 20 minutes before we could even put our name in. Once we got to the host, we were told the wait was going to be an hour and a half long. We put in our name, they took our number, and we were told that they would text us when our table was ready. 

Their timing was pretty spot on as we got a text right at the hour and a half mark. We went to the host and we were quickly seated by the window outlooking the street. Our waiter came to greet us, who was extremely nice and sincere and took our drink order. I ended up getting the GT Cooler which had gin, cucumber, sake, and lemon soda. It was incredibly refreshing and had a good gin kick to it. 

For food, I ordered the famous lobster roll which I had heard great things about, and I got a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was okay. It had a lot of horseradish to it and it was very, very wet. It was almost soup-like. The lobster roll was nicely seasoned and the bread was nice and fluffy...but it's extremely small. It tasted great, but is it worth the price? I don't think it is. 

Again our waiter was extremely kind and brought us a complimentary tuna crudo, which was fresh and really, really good. The service was truly great, the food was good, I just don't think the portions measure up to the price value. Would I bring friends visiting? Maybe? Would I specifically think to go here on a casual dine night? No. Would I go here on a date? Maybe? I just think it has a great deal of hype...but it's not my favorite spot in the Portland food scene."
131,"This place is awesome!!!!! If you're looking for super fresh seafood, you definitely need to come here. Even if you have a picky eater with you, you should check this place out because they have a burger and fried chicken sandwich on the menu for the non-seafood lovers.

The food here is amazing. Must haves are the lobster stew (my favorite thing I tried) and the oysters (duh!). The lobster stew had sooo much lobster in it and had a really interesting curry flavor. You could tell this came right out because it was super hot, which I love! I'm not that knowledgable about oysters even though I eat them fairly often, but our waiter was very helpful in choosing some for us. For sauces, I tried the red wine mignonette, Kimchee ice and red onion ice. They were all great and I'd recommend them all.

I also tried the lobster roll which was delicious! It came on an Asian style bao-type bun, which was interesting. I'd also recommend the cold scallops appetizer (raw scallops with shaved Brussels sprouts). The scallops were amazing but I think the Brussels were a little too salty/miso-y for my taste.

The one negative about this place is how crazy crowded it is all the time. If you prefer going somewhere for a lengthy, relaxing meal - this isn't your place. The hostess seemed very frazzled/overwhelmed and even though we arrived at 11:20 (20 mins after opening on a Saturday), we had to wait about 20 mins. Luckily you can give them your number to text so you don't have to wait right outside."
132,"We were curious to try this place out as it had such great reviews and we were told it's a must-do in Portland. 

We came after dinner (yay for second dinners!) as we were warned portions were small. We got  1/2 dozen oysters, a couple of lobster rolls, and a clam chowder. I got a Maine ginger beer (non alcoholic) and my s.o. got a mezcal cocktail (forget the name) that the server warned us was really strong and not that great (she was right). Others at the table loved their celery martinis. 

The oysters were fantastic. The lobster roll was very tasty and I get it's all about the artistic nature, but I have a hard time dropping $15 on two bites of food, even if it is delicious. 

The clam chowder, however, was really unappetizing. It was not very creamy and was overpowered by the wakame slices. It tasted very much like hot seaweed milk with potatoes and few clams, if any. It was a real disappointment. 

Service was stellar. The oyster shooters were tempting. A companion's fried chicken sandwich was a surprising normal-sized portion. 

I really wish I could love this place, but I can't. I had far better meals elsewhere in Portland."
133,"Just a spectacular place! We stopped in for a late lunch, had great cocktails followed by 6 oysters, scallops in bacon and the black cod special. The cod was just extraordinary, so much so that the excellent scallops were relatively speaking not quite as nice as they would have been on their own. 

Highly recommend that you make this stop when you're in the"
134,"Though it was a weekend, and the weather was amazing, if a place already has a wait at 4:00 or 4:30 P.M., you know it's going to be good.  I knew that it might cost me a pretty penny, but I wanted to get myself some seafood while I was up in Maine. Well, I can safely say I made the right choice!

To start off I had some oysters. While I don't know if there was some kind of ""oyster repository"" in the back, having fresh oysters always added to the pile, and having them right in front of you really reinforced the freshness.  I don't know the first thing about oysters, so I told my server to ""surprise me"".Again, I don't know the first thing about oysters, but the ones my server surprise me with were strong enough to have flavor, but in my opinion not too intimidating.  a good assortment.

For the main course, I had myself the much applauded, very delicious, but somewhat undersized lobster roll. First, you have to start with the delicious bun,  So soft and gentle, without distracting from the texture and flavor of the main event.  the brown butter was amazing, it tied everything together really well adding that silky, and for lack of a better word ""buttery"" flavor. Finally, there's the all-important lobster!  it was very tender, very flavorful, and Kurt perfectly. I also like that they did not skimp on it relative to the size of the roll.

However, while I realized good lobsters are expensive, I do have to mention I was taken aback by how small this thing actually was, I'm talking appetizer size. It was this that caused me to dock a star.

Nevertheless, if you're up in Maine and looking for some good seafood, I think I know we need to go. (it's here if you don't catch my drift)."
135,"Five stars and then some. The best food experience we had on our trip from Orlando, Portland, DC and Seattle and one of the most memorable restaurants I've ate at. Their take on the Lobster Roll was the best in Portland. We came and tried rolls all over at the other highly rated restaurants, but Eventide was so good, we came back again (in our 2.5 days in Portland!). Even when you roll in at 10PM those lobster rolls are perfection. The only qualm a have is how tiny it is! Look at the pic - it's half the length of a butter knife! I finished in 3 bites and cried because it was over much too soon. 

What sets this restaurant apart is the delicate Asian influences subtly incorporated throughout the dishes. The lobster roll uses a Chinese steamed bun - I actually like this more than the traditional roll because the lobster flavor comes through more. The nori in the clam chowder is typical of a ramen bowl. 

Even my friend who was used to the traditional cold mayo lobster roll preferred this one. 

Come here and then come back and don't bother having rolls anywhere else. I would come back to Portland ME just for Eventide."
136,"Brown butter lobster roll was bomb. So oily, flavorful and juicy. I prefer butter over mayo. The oysters were so fresh I wanted more. Half a dozen wasn't enough. They were pricy but if you go in during happy hour it's better. The fish nuggets were soo good and fresh it tasted like crab meat. 

The clam chowder is a bit different. Kinda like miyeok guk and clam chowder blended into one. It was more on the watery side but the clams and bacon was soo good. Kinda wish it was more bland. It gets salty afterwards

I wish they open up in nyc."
137,"Came for their oysters and unique lobster rolls! The dining experience has a different take on your seafood classics. 

Fair warning, there is a line. I arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday and it was still super busy. We waited around 20 minutes in line outside in order to put our name down for a table (and the wait on top of that was 20/30 minutes). Be patient though as the food is worth it!! 

The restaurant was a bright vibrant interior but as it is a bit small, I would not recommend it for very large parties. 

Oysters: The waiter was kind and helped us in ordering raw oysters. There was a sheet of paper that showed us which ones we were eating. Personally I am not a fan of raw oysters but this place changed my mind! They were beautifully served on a tray of ice and had this great flavor without being too fishy. 

Lobster Rolls: This is served in the white asian steamed buns instead of your typical bread. The bread is a lot softer and doesn't have a crunch. Lobster is also made with brown butter. It was delicious! Different texture but it all melted in your mouth! 

Oyster Roll: The oysters were lightly fried with some jalapeños on top, also sandwiched in between the asian steamed buns. Also delicious. 

Grilled Swordfish: Came with two spicy/curry sauces that were great! The fish was so beautifully smooth and came apart easily with your fork! 

Clam Chowder: Not what you expect. It is not that typical creamy/white/thick texture. It has a thin base with mini-cut potatoes and lovely bits of clam. The clam itself was great but I think I prefer your standard creamy clam chowder. 

Overall the food was delicious! Downside though is that the potions are very small and all the dishes are pretty pricey."
138,"Yes, Eventide has a gazillion positive reviews, but the food here was even better than I expected.

I guess we were lucky that we came here at a time between lunch and dinner, because we didn't have to wait for a table at all. We sat at the communal table with a bunch of rowdy folks, but I guess that's part of the experience.

Everything that we tried here has a hint of Asian cuisine. I loved the Brussel Sprouts . It's served in a large bowl and I think I almost finished it all. I also ordered the Brown Butter Lobster Roll. It's a small roll, but it's excellent. I also ate half of my wife's Fried Chicken Sandwich because it was so delicious. The mustard and pickle gives it a nice kick and is not your typical chicken sandwich that you order at a fast food place. The only item that I didn't like was the Kim Chee. I'm normally a big fan of kimchi, but the one here tasted more like onions than cabbage.

Overall, everything here was great. I highly recommend Eventide if you're visiting Portland."
139,"My boyfriend and I visited Eventide for dinner while up in Portland for the weekend. We were very excited to eat there after a recommendation from our Airbnb host. Arriving on a Friday night without a reservation, we waited 45 minutes for a table. 

We ordered oysters with kimchi ice, the lobster roll, lobster stew, and New England clam bake. The food was overall, just fine and overpriced. My boyfriend very much liked the kimchi ice and found it a unique and delicious accompaniment to the oysters. The lobster roll was very small, and I did not find the bao-style bun to go as well with the lobster as a typical maine lobster roll bun does. The lobster stew was the highlight of the meal in my opinion - it's made with coconut milk and has a great Thai taste. Finally, the New England clam bake was a bit of a disappointment. It has maybe a dozen steamers and a dozen mussels, one small lobster tail, two small fingerling potato, two small pieces of bacon and a boiled egg. Steamed and served with butter, I felt these lack some additional flavoring. 

In addition, we waited 45 minutes to be seated at a counter. Seats were not very comfortable and there was not much space for all the food we ordered."
140,"If you are able to get a table at Eventide without a huge wait you're in luck. We walked right in because it was the middle of the week and they had just opened. 

The decor inside is bright and vibrant,  we were seated at their picnic bench style tables. Most of their menu is set up as shareable plates, so it can be a little unsatisfying in that sense if you're trying to stuff your face. 

We ordered their classic lobster rolls which were to die for. It really is probably the best lobster roll in Portland, although I don't know if it's authentic enough for the folks in Maine. Either way it's amazing and well worth it, its warm lobster with brown butter served on a house made bun. It can be devoured in 2 bites so order more than one. 

We also ordered the chips which were an enjoyable side, albeit unspectacular. We finished up with the oatmeal pie which was delicious but not quite up to the standards of diminutive debra.

Pricing is a little on the high side and parking is non existent."
141,"For all the hype it gets, I was not at all impressed with Eventide. My friends were in town and wanted to try lobster rolls so I thought - EVENTIDE! I was really excited because I hadn't yet been.

Wait Time: 30 minutes; 3:30 PM on a Tuesday in Summer
Service: Great, server was on her A game
Cleanliness: Our Table was still wet/dirty from the people prior 
Atmosphere: Great. Made me feel like I was eating in a high class fish market
Food: just EH
Drinks: Did not get a cocktail! (for once)
Price: Not worth it for me.

My friends got the lobster rolls, they said they were good - but definitely not out-of-this-world amazing. 
I got a haddock ceviche and was very disappointed. I didn't realize I was ordering a side dish! The portion was so small, for 15$! I wish the menu was more clearly labeled with meals that are appetizers vs. entrees. 

My friends and I went for pizza down the street after because we were still hungry. Maybe I just don't appreciate seafood? Either way, I don't see myself going back to Eventide."
142,"Came here for dinner late one night and was absolutely blown away. 
I first ordered the lobster roll and this was definitely the best in New England. Very buttery and full of flavor. 
I then went on to the oysters and being a novice the waitress offered to pick them out for me which was very nice. I can say that every type I tried was fantastic. 
With that being said I went on to the desert and heard about their ice cream sandwich made between two homemade cookies and WOW! I can't emphasize how good that cookie was on a ice cold night as well. 
The service made the experience everyone was so friendly and if you sit at the bar you can watch your oysters be prepared which was very cool."
143,"It was our first time visiting Portland, ME and Eventide was one of the restaurants that everyone suggested. I'm from Seattle and take a lot of pride in our seafood, which makes me a little biased. That being said I was nothing but IMPRESSED with our meal, the comfortable ambiance and amazing service.

It gets busy, so be prepared to wait. But feel free to order a drink and snack while you wait, the staff is super helpful and makes your wait as comfortable as possible. We had a couple of well crafted bloody mary's while we waited for our table. 

Once seated the service continued to be top notch. All we knew as that we wanted the lobster role, so we asked for guidance from our server. She was probably the best server I've had in the past 5 years. She advised us through the menu, we expressed our dietary preferences and she suggested the best things on the menu. 

We ordered everything she suggested and were SO HAPPY we did. The lobster role is the best I've ever had! All of the fish was so fresh and delicious. We ordered every special on the menu and even something that our server suggested that was not on the menu. The fresh fish arrived in the morning and the thought of the dish a couple hours prior to serving it to us! The seafood was treated with care, delicate and flavorful with a hint of whimsy. 

Our server also brought us an additional lobster role on the house since it was accidentally made in excess. I will definitely be going there again on my next visit and you should too! Every time I think about my meal, my mouth waters."
144,"Great food with a twist. Helpful and fast service. Crowded. 

My wife and I visited on a Saturday around lunchtime. We arrived 10 minutes before opening, but were greeted by a long line. The line moved quickly and soon we had to bar seats at the window. 

Our server was friendly, fast and had great recommendations. He recommended the tuna cruo and the fried oyster rolls. We got both, along with several other items. 

We started with the Chowder. This isn't the traditional clam chowder - as opposed to being creamy, this was thinner and lighter. The broth itself was delightful - flavorful and satisfying, without the heaviness. The potatos and clams were equally tasty. We ordered two bowls, but we probably could have gotten away with one to split. 

Next up was the Tuna Crudo. This was a recommendation from our server and was truly a delight. The tuna was melt in your mouth tender and the light dressing was the perfect compliment. I wish we would have ordered two. 

The brown butter lobster roll was next. The size is small (if you're sharing - you're only getting a bit or two), but it was tasty. The bun was not your traditional bread, but rather it was more like a steamed bun. I will say this was my least favorite thing we had, but it was still very good. (For me, its hard to beat a regular old lobster roll). 

The fried oyster roll was next and was another crowd pleaser. Again, served on a steam bun-like roll, the fried oyster roll is packed full of flavor. And like the lobster roll, this is a smaller item (I've included my hand in the picture to give size reference). 

We also ordered the heirloom tomato salad. I love heirloom tomatoes and will order them on almost any menu. This was served with an eggplant mash and pepitas. This was such a nice combination of sweet, savory and crunchy. 

Eventide also has a great oyster bar (we skipped it, as the wedding we were attending later was serving oysters) and an even better regular bar (alcohol bar?). 

Overall this is a great place to share a drink and some great twists on classic seafood."
145,"Didn't have a large meal, but did snack on a lobster roll and some Maine crab claws. I tried their mai tai to wash down the food. The lobster roll was warm and buttery, but definitely small. Maybe half the size of a regular bun. Three bites and it was gone. The crab claws were meaty. Definitely worth it. 

They do have a good size oyster bar. I didn't try their oysters, but it did notice they were popular. We arrived right before the crowd and were lucky to be seated right away. We sat at the bar. The bar tender was fast.  The food also came out pretty fast. Before we knew it, there was a long line to be seated, so get there early."
146,"Brown. Butter. Lobster. Roll.

It was life changing. No other lobster roll I'll have in the future will ever live up. I'm sure, they'll be delicious but they won't be THIS delicious. Eventide's rolls are smaller, as are most dishes here (think shared plates/tapas sized) so if you're super hungry and JUST want a lobster roll I'd recommend two. I wish I had order another one. 

But instead we also split a few other plates, including the delicious clam chowder. There's is a bit different than traditional clam chowders (a little less thick) but SO delicious. The oysters are also amazing, of course, and they have a fantastic variety of east coast options. So fresh! I had previously thought I wasn't a big fan of east coast oysters (preferring west) but I guess I've just had the wrong kinds because these were fantastic. The tuna tartare was also quite good. The halibut was also tasty and a whoopie pie for dessert is a must. 

The restaurant itself is always busy but they have a fantastic automated system so you can track your progress on the wait list and you'll get a text when your table is close to be being ready. I love this because it allowed us to wander a bit and explore Portland a bit for the hour we were waiting for our table. Outdoor seating was also a treat!

A bit on the pricey side but worth every penny. The food is outstanding."
147,"Be prepared for a wait. For a table of 2 at 2 pm on a summer Friday, we waited around 40 minutes. They have a mobile system that texts you when your table is ready so that you can walk around the nearby art galleries while waiting.

The oysters were an automatic order. We had the waiter order us a variety of a dozen of oysters, and we weren't disappointed. Every oyster was a little different, meaty, and flavorful. They give you an options of toppings for your oysters, including a delicious red wine one.

The lobster roll was also refreshing, luscious, and tasty - though we would have a preferred a buttery toast to hug our lobster. The clam chowder had depth, layers of flavor and was surprisingly light.

They also had blueberry pie on the menu the day we went, and you better believe we ordered it! It was full of fresh blueberries with a good helping of homemade-tasting cream."
148,"Fantastic food, great service, and altogether a gastronomic orgy...so good!  That brown butter lobster roll is to die for...have never had anything like it anywhere else!  Just wished that they took reservations, but while we waited an hour, it was well worth the wait.  We will most definitely be returning soon!"
149,"This is a definite stop if it's your first time to Portland and especially if you love the oyster. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait, but the staff is super on point and will assign you a spot to chill (and serve you drinks) until you table (or spot at the bar) is ready. It's worth it. Seriously."
150,"Eventide Oyster Company is the place to go to seafood and be seafood (see and be seen). Alright, poor dad joke but you get the picture!

If you're here during peak eating times, you'll likely have to wait. If you're like me and want to be there before opening (11AM), I recommend arriving at least 45 minutes before to be first in line. Do not come shorter than 30 minutes before opening to be sure you have a solid spot for you and your party. The line starts to stack hard 15 minutes before opening. This, of course, applies to the weekend, not sure about the weekdays.

You obviously need to get on that Eventide Brown Butter Lobster Roll. I would also try the New England Clam Bake if you want a good sampler of the goodness they can serve you (steamers, mussels, lobster tail, potatoes, salt pork and a hard boiled egg nestled into a bed of rock seaweed, served with drawn butter). My wife and I were moderately hungry and these 2 items hit the spot. If we wanted more, we would've also ordered a half dozen oysters and clam chowder but we were happy with just these 2 items. Note that the lobster roll is small and good enough for 1 person--consider not sharing it since it's so good.

Pro-tip: Get a local Allagash beer on tap since it's a lot more expensive in the rest of the country!"
151,"Came on a Saturday night around 7 and was told there was about an hour wait, the hostess sent me a text to let us know our seats were ready. I was impressed when I walked back in, the hostess remembered my name. 

We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartenders craft cocktails. All three of us were basic and got the lobster roll and whoopie pie. Both were very tasty. Highly recommend!"
152,"I came here during dinner with my family. Fortunately we went a little earlier before the lunch rush so it wasn't too long of a wait for a table. We got a table right at the bar so we got a good view of the bartender and shuckers. 

The oysters we got were pretty good although not very large and one of them had a piece of the shell in it. The lobster roll was definitely the most unique lobster roll I've ever tried. However don't expect much from it, it is tiny. 

The service was decent and the people there were pretty nice. Overall it was a good experience (although not cheap at all). It's worth going to if you're in the area but definitely try to avoid the dinner rush cuz the wait can be brutal."
153,"It was a great quick dinner and drinks with a friend. The place is hopping and had a constant stream of customers thru my visit. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. My friend was running late so I sat at the bar, where you can eat there as well, the server was so friendly. She offered a food suggestion while I waited for my friend. And checked in on me occasionally. 

Once my friend arrived we went for the oysters. Which might have been my second or third time. We asked for options and our server was again so helpful. We tried three varieties. A serving was 12 so we gave it a whirl. The options were awesome and the bacon scallops hit the spot for me. 

I hear their seafood is great so will have to go back and give their options a try."
154,"Foodgasms galore! I grew up in Maine and have had my share of lobster rolls across the world, but Eventide HANDS DOWN takes the cake for the best one I have ever eaten. I am still dreaming about how delicious it was. But it isn't just the lobster roll that is amazing here. Literally every dish I tried surprised me with it's unique and unexpected flavor combos. There was nothing I ate that was not outstanding. 

Be prepared for a bit of a wait when visiting Eventide. We arrived on a Saturday around 1:30PM there was a two hour wait-but no wait if we wanted to stand at the bar area. We were totally fine with that. The standing area doesn't have much counter space, but you get a lovely view of Oysters on ice. Despite not being at a table, our server was super attentive and on point. She helped us pick Oysters which were all outstanding. I loved my Oyster jalapeño/vodka shooter as well. It was a nice start to my seafood adventure. We ordered several dishes and added more because everything was so amazing. The first out was the mussels dish. The combination of crispy potatoe and juicy mussels, with spicy and creamy mayo flavor was out of this world. 
The lobster roll with brown butter was one of the best things i've ever eaten. The lobster is piled on top of a fluffy chinese bun. This combo is incredible. The lobster itself is seasoned and buttered to perfection. I could have eaten eighteen thousand of them. 
Next up we had the smoked Icelandic Char. With the combo of everything spice, smoked salmon and onion it really felt like diving into a bagel. The tuna crudo with ginger-scallion, tare and radish was the best i've ever had. If you are a martini fan, the dirty dirty martini with oyster brine and hot sauce was impeccable, and went very well with my seafood. As we left around 3pm, the wait and crowd was dying down, so I recommend coming between rush times if you can. 

Overall, we are excited to come back and try more options on our next trip to Portland. Do not miss eating here."
155,"Eventide had a line a mile long even in the middle of the afternoon. We got our name on the list and didn't get a text back for a couple hours (they told us this was the wait) Once we finally got in and seated, the entire restaurant was hopping the entire time. Plates of the freshest seafood and crustaceans kept coming by, tempting our palates. You can sit either outside (facing a street) or inside, which was painted in pastel blues and beach reminiscent. 

The four of us ordered cocktails along with oysters, crab, scallops, and their tuna waffle (sounds weird but was amazing). Everything is small plates style, so if you are looking for a full meal I would suggest at least 2 per person, but I would completely suggest sharing. Everything we tried was incredibly fresh. A hip raw bar...if you can get in."
156,"THE BEST LOBSTER ROLLS.  Such a unique version of a Maine staple dish.  It was soo good and wish I lived in Portland just so I could have it more often.  We also had the Lobster chowder, which was actually my favorite dish of the night.  Couldn't stop eating it - the intense curry buttery flavors were hard to resist.  It was also surprising how fresh the lobster still tasted in a hot soup.  

Warning: we did come very early at 4pm on Sunday Labor Day weekend, and had a 2 hour wait.  They did have a great texting system that allows you to go wherever you want nearby and they notify you when you're table is almost ready.  We got drinks at a nearby brewery, so was able to pass the time well.  Very much worth the wait!"
157,"We went here for the first time and we were very happy with what we ordered (which was quite a few things.) Be aware that they take traditional seafood dishes and add their own spin to them. Some examples are:

1.) The oysters: They were delicious (we did a dozen and let the waitress select different types from all over Maine). The horseradish ice is a nice touch.

2.) The tuna crudo: (If you're not into raw fish then maybe not for you but we ordered this on a whim and it ended up being one of my favorite things).

3.) The CEVICHE: The best thing we ordered hands-down. I haven't found ceviche this good since I lived in Ecuador.

4.) Lobster roll: It was great but very different than any lobster roll you've ever had. On a asian-like bun and the sauce it is in is very unique.

5.) The fish sandwich: Really yummy and unlike any fish sandwich I've ever eaten. There was a nice aioli on it that really gave it a nice flavor.

6.) The nori chips: These are homemade potato chips sprinkled with seaweed. These sounded awesome but they were actually kind of ""meh."" Wouldn't get them again.

7.) Fried oysters: These were yummy but a little bit spicy for my taste.

Great atmosphere, great service, horrible parking. They don't take reservations and it's a small space so be forewarned. It's the quintessential downtown experience."
158,"Worth the 1.5+ hour wait, if you plan for it. We ended up putting our name down, getting a small snack somewhere else to tide us over, and then wandering the surrounding area; there is plenty to keep you busy while you wait. 

We ordered half a dozen oysters, a lobster roll, and the tuna crudo. 

I do appreciate the spin on the traditional lobster roll, but the sweetness of the bao distracted from the sweetness of the lobster for me. The oysters were really fresh, I'm not well versed on different types of oysters, but I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong here. The oysters were all really fresh and came with your choices of accroutremonts. Lastly, please do yourself a favor and try the tuna crudo! So. Delicious.

Definitely worth a stop in, if you have the time!"
159,"No denying it - the food here is exceptional! With over 2000 reviews on yelp alone, you know that this place will have a long wait so be prepared to come early and wait often. We went around 2-3 for a late lunch and were hoping to beat the rush but there was still half an hour wait. We waited by the bar and had a few drinks. The vibe inside is light and fresh with a beach theme and serves up great drinks. 

My favorite item here has to be the lobster roll - after having a few rolls around Portland, the flavor and presentation here was simply the best. Do keep in mind that this is a tapas style place so the food portion is smaller than usual but quality over quantity any day. The oysters and the lobster stew was great as well but I'd definitely come back for the lobster roll. 

The service was so so on the day we went but I think they were understaffed. We had to repeatedly ask for water refills and it took them 15 mins to come to take our orders after we'd been seated. That's the only reason they didn't receive 5 stars from me but I would highly recommend this place if you like seafood... but bear in mind they are busy and the service can be slow."
160,"Maine Uni TostadaTostada- 4/5 - what a unique dish! The sturgeon roe and the uni were a 5. Carrot puree was great but could do with just a little bit less of it so it doesn't overpower the uni. Otherwise the uni and roe are a great cut to the sweetness of the puree. 

Lobster Stew - 5/5 - Sooooo much lobster. Miyake mushrooms are out of this world! Similar consistency to lobster but not as meaty. So happy they are in there. The big chunks of carrots are perfect too, a little but of sweetness.  yes there's alot of butter and i typically can't handle a ton of butter but it was soooo tasty and not too rich and didn't linger on my tongue. It's a green coconut curry broth but not typical thai style, very light flavor. 

Brown butter lobster roll - 4/5 - too much with the lobster stew cause both buttery lobster but tasty still.  A little hard to keep in the bun, it's almost on top, with a shallow cut in the Chinese bun. 

Clam Chowder -  4/5 - the oil makes it, whatever it was lol. Good fusion on a classic soup 

Service - 5/5 - so sweet and excited at just about everything we ordered. Very knowledgeable about oysters. We explained what type of west coast oysters we like and she suggested ones that were on point. All very fresh and a little briny."
161,"Stopped in at Eventide Co. because I saw all the great reviews. The reviews did not steer me wrong. We order a half dozen oysters, mostly the local areas. They were SO great we had to order more! Second time, we ordered a whole dozen! It really was that great!! I highly recommend!! And they geniusly infused different sauces (Tabasco, horseradish, kimchi, etc) with ice so it keeps the oysters cold as you slurp them up! There's not enough words to rave about this place's oysters!

We also ordered their lobster rolls. Those were fantastic too! Rich in buttery goodness. At $15 a roll, I would have actually saved my money for more oysters! Love this place though! Would definitely come back next time I'm in town!!"
162,"Please please get the lobster roll, my lord. Drinks are also delicious.. you can't go wrong at this place"
163,"Visited Eventide on a not-so-great out Monday evening with a coworker. We arrived At 615pm and the hostess said the restaurant just filled up - so we grabbed standing room at the bar for a drink & to admire the area. We were seated within 15min. 

I order a gin/cucumber cocktail that wasn't the best itself, but very refreshing with different plates we ordered. 

We started out with a dozen oysters and the lobster stew. I don't know much about oysters, but they tasted great. My coworker, who loves his oysters, was raving about them. The stew was great too, not creamy and heavy but packed with lobster and very flavorful. 

We then ordered the main dishes of brown butter lobster rolls, tuna tartare & black cod (a special for the evening). The lobster rolls were truly the best I've ever had - sweet, warm, packed with lobster, just too small! The tuna was great, but very small as well. Probably wouldn't get that again just as I don't think it's worth $15. The black cod was unbelievable. Small too but unique and done very well. 

For dessert (all made in house) my coworker got the pie of the day (some cranberry concoction) and I the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Fabulous! But put me over the edge as far as fullness. 

For 3 cocktails, dozen oysters, 2 lobster rolls, 2 stews, tuna tartare, black cod, and 2 desserts, the total was $170. We definitely overindulged, but it was worth it!

Ps parking is on the street, $3 (coin or card) for 2 hours max."
164,"It's hard to find places to eat when traveling with your pup so we were grateful to find outdoor seating here. Outdoor space is limited to a few tables and the wait can be very long. The first time we tried to eat here, we were quoted a 2.5 hour wait so we had to find alternative plans. The second time, we put our names down early and came back later. 

Lobster are served differently here. Eventide is known for their brown-butter lobster roll served on a Chinese steamed bun, a departure from Maine or Connecticut style on a hot dog bun. This means a more squishy and stew-feeling lobster roll which could be a hit or a miss depending on who you ask. 

Lobster stew has a delicious Thai spin on it. It's coconut-creamy with plenty of maitake mushrooms and lobster pieces in a green curry soup. This was definitely the table favorite."
165,"Let me start out with a positive; OUTSTANDING clam chowder. I'm mean really good. Not the thick broth that you see in a lot of restaurants, but very tasty. Not just clams but full clam necks in it. 
I also had two rolls; fries oyster and pastrami. The rolls were fresh but there was not much fried oyster or pastrami.  Overpriced, but I would go back for the chowder alone."
166,"O M G!!!!!!! you MUST MUST MUST come here if you're in Portland!! The food is so delicious and service is amazing.

The location is very small, we almost walked passed it. We showed up at 1:30 pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was very little wait. We were seated at the bar, where we had a perfect view of the oysters being shucked. 

The plates are pretty small, so we ordered two entrees each. In total, we ordered two lobster rolls, one crab roll, and one scallop waffle special. The dishes come out as they are ready, which was really really fast. It took about 5 minutes for all the rolls to come out, and about 10 minutes for the waffle.

The rolls were on a steamed bun rather than the traditional hamburger bun. GREAT move. The bun was so so fluffy and warm, and the filling was so flavorful and delicious. The amount of butter in the lobster roll and the mayo in the crab roll were perfect. And the meat tasted very very fresh.

The waffle was very delicious as well. It was small but very flavorful. The yaki sauce and seaweed on the waffle was very good. 

My only complaint is that the bathroom is very small/wait is long. I really need to use the bathroom but there was a line the entire time I was at the restaurant. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner since it's a bit crowded and the portions and small, but it is an amazing place for lunch. Super quick and friendly service and delicious food. Highly recommend!!!!"
167,"This place lives up to the hype.......
Rolled in feeling a little off after bar hopping the night before. (Yes, I do realize that more drinking and oysters hungover sounds gross. ). Ordered some amazing lobster soup that made all my ails go away.   Immediately felt well enough that I pretty much sampled the entire menu. One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had, sushi grade tuna, oysters with amazing add ons. I am in heaven here. The staff is great and service is quick. Get here early and sit at the bar to avoid a wait and crowds."
168,"We stopped in to sample raw Maine oysters and were satisfied! The wait at Eventide was two hours, even on a rainy Saturday night. The good thing about the wait is we could go online to see the number of parties ahead of us and walk around the area or check out some bars while we waited. 

We let our server choose his favorite oysters for us and they were all delicious, sweet and not too briny, which was what we requested. I really enjoyed the ice selection to top the oysters, giving the flavors an extra oomph! The ices were frozen juices from brines and shaved like a slushie. The best combos were red wine minionette, red onion ice and horseradish ice. Black pepper ice was good but too overpowering on the delicate oysters, and kimchi ice was too pungent. 

My friends got the ouster shooters, which came with a 4 or 6-oz cocktail, but my friends said it wasn't really worth $7, and they'd rather just eat more oysters without the shot. We also orders raw clams, which were juicy and sweet. 

Staff were friendly and I would definitely recommend Eventide for the raw bar. I would also return for the cooked selections."
169,"Had the best lunch at eventide! The only complaint is the wait because of the shortage of seating, but definitely worth the wait. 

While we were waiting, I got an Empire Of The Sun drink - I love gin and would definitely consider this a more sweet/tangy drink than most gin drinks. 

I ordered the lobster rolls which were great! Great alternative if you don't like mayo lobster rolls. Rolls were $15. My aunt ordered the lobster stew which she really liked as well. Our waitress was the bartender and she was awesome! Super attentive and quick with our orders/getting us our food."
170,"Ridiculously small portions and over priced menu options. This place is incredibly over-rated. My friends and I only had one night in Portland and one shot at dinner. I must admit the quality is a decent and food is relatively fresh, but it's certainly not worth it. 
We had lobster roll which was under éntre, but it could barely serve as an appetizer. The portions were so small that even one of their new hired thought it was our starter! 
There are many other better quality and cheaper options in Portland as we found out later."
171,"Not really understand where the hype comes from. I mean it's a good vibe and the plating is good, but the food is really just OK. I got the lobster roll and tuna tartar. 

The lobster roll is different because they use the Chinese bun rather than the normal bun. It didn't make it taste better or worse. It's just a lobster roll. The tuna tartar's flavor is not that good, so I had to keep getting more sriracha to cover it up. 

Overall, this is a place you should come to take pictures and post on Instagram, but not for good food though."
172,"OMG YUM!  Eventide Oyster Company was my favorite place we ate while on our trip to Portland.  The staff was friendly and our waitress was awesome and super helpful on our oyster decisions.   You have to try it out!

We came for their Lobster Roll.  It's $15.00 and on the small side, but I promise you it is totally worth every penny.  It comes out on a warm soft bun and the lobster bits are huge.  My friend even ordered two!  If they delivered, I'd honestly consider seeing if they'd come to Alabama!   Their raw oysters were mouth watering!  We ordered a dozen of their top recommended oysters.  When ordering you have the option to add tabasco ice, Worcestershire ice and whatever other condiments you'd want on the side.  The drinks were so-so.  I ordered a spritzer of some sort, but I was not a big fan.  For $10, you best believe I finished every last drop!  The bloody mary was pretty good, though!

When planning your trip to Eventide, be prepared to wait awhile if you go at normal eating times.  The restaurant is pretty small, so the wait time adds up fast.  Our group went around 10:30 AM on a Saturday to be added to the waitlist for lunch.  By the time our table was ready, it was around 1 hour later - perfect for lunch."
173,"WOW. I honestly thought this place would not live up to all the hype (and high prices), but boy, was I wrong!

I had the yellowfin tuna crudo to start and it blew me away. It might actually have been one of the best things I've ever eaten so far in my 27 years of food. The quality of the fish combined with the exceptional flavors on top really blew me away and just melted in my mouth.  I would come back for this alone.

Then I had the lobster roll. The famed lobster roll. Yes it's tiny, yes it's $15, and yes it's worth it. The sweet soft roll is the perfect holder for the mound of lobster on top. And the lobster is seasoned just enough to create flavor and not too much that you forget it's lobster.  

Pro tip: they don't advertise fries on their menu, only potato chips, but if you ask, you can get them. Apparently they're usually for kids, but hey, I'm not that old!

Ambiance is casual and fun. This place isn't huge so I'd come alone again, or with one other. Sitting at the bar by the window provided nice people watching."
174,"Lobster Stop #2 on our Lobster Fest Day Trip!

Took the Uber from Bite Into Maine to Eventide!

Staff were super friendly and let us order drinks at the bar while we waited for seats and what a view that was! Of all the fresh varieties of oysters! I've never tried oysters but here I am with my friend who loves oysters. And guess what she did? She did an oyster shot! Ugh cringeeee. She also ordered half dozen of their best oysters. It wasn't that bad slurping cold slimy mollusks.. not my favorite but at least I tried. Tried the deep fried oysters and well and they weren't too bad.

BUT MY BROWN BUTTER LOBSTER ROLL was the star of my lunch. YUM YUM YUM. Especially that it's in a bao bread or what we're familiar with, Chinese bread. Loving the softness. If only they were bigger ah!"
175,"Came here with friends for a few drinks and small bites. There was a 45 min wait but it seemed reasonable given the good things I've heard about this place both on Yelp and via our Portland friends. 

We were seated outside which was nice and there are umbrellas over the tables to provide some relief. We ordered the oysters and lobster rolls and some beers. 

The oysters were delicious and are inside laid out fish market style (super cool and helps you see what you're ordering if you're uninitiated). Lobster rolls were heavenly and placed atop a soft yummy roll. The lobster itself was chopped but that's fine with me. 

I would like to return as along as there isn't more than a 30 min wait."
176,Everything we ate here was exceptional! But the Lobster blew it out of the water! We can't say enough good things about that roll! Delicious!
177,"I loveeee this place!!! I am so happy I made a pit stop here on my way back to nyc. The food here is phenomenal and the only thing I'm mad about is that I didn't order more. The fish sandwich, lobster roll, fried oyster sandwich and the Brussels sprouts were complete hits here. The drinks were soo good too! If I ever make my way back to Portland this will be my first stop."
178,"This place is small and incredibly popular, so make sure you plan ahead. We just wandered over hoping it wouldn't be busy at 3 pm on a Sunday, but we were wrong. The wait was an hour or we were able to go in immediately if we stood at an elevated ledge along the wall. Since it has been highly recommended and it was our last day in the area, we decide to suck it up. And we're so glad we did!

A lot of the items on the menu looked good, but we were on a lobster mission so we ordered the brown butter lobster roll and the lobster stew. I can't even decide which was better. Both were full of lobster, amazingly flavored and insanely delicious. Definitely worth standing for."
179,"Solid place to grab seafood, though higher priced and smaller portion than other portland eateries around. Quality is surely there though.

Started with 1/2 dozen oysters with 3 different varieties per recommendation by our waitress. These were the freshest oysters I've had to date, and I can definitely see why EOC was voted one of the top oyster places in the nation. 

Seafood chowder with coconut milk had good flavor, but it was really salty for our taste, but we finished it due to the cold weather outside.

Lobster roll was definitely delicious - brown butter lobster stuffed in a warm, chinese bun. Great flavor and texture all around, but ridiculously small portion.

We just came for small bites so these were all we got, but place was packed and bumping with locals grabbing drinks and food (mostly non-seafood with korean and other asian flares). Great spot."
180,"I recommend eating here for their late night happy hour. The oyster bun is great - I like it better than their lobster roll, which I love - the soup is delicious, and you can still get oysters and their full menu.
I really like the variety of oysters and their accouterments - the horse radish ice and the mignonette are my go-tos. Thank you to the staff who are really good about describing the flavors of what's available.
There's a decent variety of beers on tap and their mixed drinks are tasty, with a few tiki drinks thrown in. Even with people who don't drink alcohol, the bartenders make really good mocktails.
The only two things they can do better: 1. More accurate on the wait times as I've waited longer for tables than the original estimate (go over rather than under, please). 2. The prices of the oysters are high - $16 for a half dozen isn't something I'm used to seeing."
181,"Definitely one of the best tasting meals we had on our vacation.  Eventide does high end seafood right with good service, nice presentation and excellent quality.  We were visiting Portland ME for the day and Yelped up this great restaurant. Being in the mood for some raw oysters we order a dozen oysters to start that came served on ice with a large serving of their black pepper ice and cocktail sauce.  They were excellent with the pepper ice being a great garnish for the oysters.   We could not resist sharing a brown butter lobster roll a house special (and the best lobster roll we had on our trip). We then had the steamed seafood combo which consisted of a half of a lobster, a dozen and a half mussels and the same quantity of steamers.  Our waiter was really great at helping us order and giving us tips on how best to eat the food we ordered.  

I was a great meal and the only suggestion I would have to improve the experience is for the restaurant to consider serving a complimentary cracker or artisan bread when ordering with maybe a small seafood dip or olive oil. This would be a great starter while ordering and ensure customers do not go away feeling hungry as a number of reviewers have commented on and be done at little cost. 

Food - 5 - Great presentation and quality. 
Atmosphere 4.5  - Clean nautical feel with varieties of  oysters displayed on trays in front of the bar.  
Service-5 - Very informative and help with customers want to try new seafoods and how to Best enjoy them!
Price - 4  - They are expensive, the quality is top notch but portions are small. See note on starter above, which would put them a notch higher. 
OA - 4.5 Stars"
182,"Eventide is a great first stop for anyone who hasn't been to Portland. 

Oysters are fresh and delicious, and the staff are super knowledgeable when it comes to ordering them. The lobster roll, while VERY flavorful and unique, is small. And I wish the lobster were in bigger chunks instead of chopped up. But it really is a must-try. 

I really liked the nori dressing on the salad too, and our oyster shooters. Those were the highlights. 

Tourist trap? Yes, definitely. But worth visiting."
183,"Excellent quality seafood that cannot be compared to anywhere else.  Like everyone else has said, it has been one of the best seafood restaurants that I've had.  Even something as simple as clam chowder was pretty perfect.  I will say that the price is incredibly high for the amount of food you get.  Even after our lunch of clam chowder, clam bake and a lobster roll, we left kind of hungry.  The lobster roll is about the size of a twinkie so splitting it was someone give you two bites or so.  With that being said, this is definitely a splurge kind of restaurant.  

The only reason this gets 4 stars versus 5 is the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It felt really pretentious and not warm and friendly.  We actually came in the night before to see if we could get a table for dinner.  When I walked up to the podium I saw the hostess clearly see me out of her peripheral but chose to ignore me.  It was really uncomfortable for me to just stand there and her pretend not to acknowledge my existence.  When I finally spoke up to get her attention she rudely just said that there was a line to see how long the wait was.  I apologized profusely because I didn't the line was just to check the wait times.  I understand that this is probably an everyday occurrence for her but for her but there was no need for her to be rude.  It left a sour taste in my mouth and we left and went to Scales for dinner instead.  I actually didn't want to come back but my bf convinced me to try their lunch which we did."
184,"The food: This place has literally the best lobster roll in the country!! The soft buttery bread, the chunks of tender juicy lobster, and the perfect amount of salt/butter/pepper. It's so fresh and unbelievably delicious. We get it every time! We also tried the scallop waffle this time - and it was truly a work of art. The creativity in the dish was palpable. I'm so impressed with the chef who had the courage and the skill to put together scallops and waffles, and make it taste phenomenal!! The flavors were incredible in it.

We also had the pie of the day - a blueberry peach oatmeal concoction. My husband and I believe that's the best fruit pie we have ever had! It was almost a bit to filling heavy, but the filling was not too sweet/ not too tart. And the crush was warm, flakey, and didn't fall apart! 


The service: the hostess and the waiters are all very nice and never seem to be in a rush - despite it always being a 2 hour wait!!! We were told a 2 hour wait, but our wait ended up being only 50 minutes! I had snuck away to ask the hostess to bring a little piece of pie with a candle on it to celebrate my husbands birthday. Our waiter  unfortunately came to us a bit after ready to get our check and said ""you didn't order a pie did you?"". I laughed it off and said a surprise piece for my husband and he felt sooo bad. But he came out with an extra whoppie pie for us! Grateful for the staffs apology and extra dessert! 

Overall: you haven't seen Portland without having been here!!"
185,"Like the lobster roll so much! A must try! This is my first time to try the roll, and it is so flavorful."
186,"As good as expected! Brunch here was so memorable - from oysters to oyster shooters to the fried oyster bun, yeah, you can never have too many oysters! The most delicious bite we ate, though, was the lobster benedict. This dish was decadent and over-the-top in the absolute best way possible. So creamy and buttery and lemony!! I'll dream of this dish for a long tome to come."
187,"The lobster roll here will definitely change your life, I'll tell you that much. And if you don't believe me, you can certainly believe the thousands of other Yelpers who thought the same. Although it is pretty small, it packs a lot of taste. I don't know how it is on weekdays here but the wait on weekends is usually upwards of an hour. Even so, people are willing to wait and we waited as well. Oysters were $16 for a half dozen which is a pretty good price. The waitress chose the oyster for us and they were a little too briny for my taste but they're also a good size."
188,"Yummmmmm
brown butter lobster roll. So juicy and flavorful. What makes it more interesting is that it's not on a traditional bread/roll but on a bao. 
My friend and I weren't too hungry so were considering splitting one but ended up getting 1 each... good decision cuz they aren't very large but they are also very delicious so sharing would have ended our friendship. 

I hope to come back and try other things on the menu!

Highly recommend.

(and afterwards, go get some french fries and milkshakes at duckfat)"
189,"Every review mentions the brown butter lobster roll for a reason. Is it small? Yes. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it delicious? HECK yes. Don't skip it.

It's a very busy place, with a line just to check in and put your name on a list. The wait can vary. We came with my brother and his family, and it was our lucky day because we got seated within 10 minutes. I was worried that given the size it might not have been the best option to bring two small kids, but we were seated at a communal table, and the hosts and servers were all extremely accommodating.

My husband and I split a dozen oysters. We know nothing about oysters, but our server picked some for us and brought a cheat sheet so we knew which was which. We also tried the potato chips, corn on the cob, and the oyster roll. Everything was fantastic, and my only complaint was that I didn't get any lobster rolls to go."
190,"If you plan in coming to this place, the you should expect a wait time since both times we came has been very busy. The food was great, all the raw seafood was delicious and so so fresh. It just slide into my belly! I felt so full afterwards but it definitely wasnt a heavy meal to where I want to pass out afterwards. Our server (she did t give us her name) was quirky and informative of all the questions we were asking. She was even putting up with my husband, who was clearly drunk, and talking way too much. I ignored him and ate since I wasnt going to wait and share with him of all he wanted was to talk to other people there. Everything was decently priced and portions were worth it. 

I do wish this place was bigger though, it's such a great place to eat out at but it is on the smaller side. Our first wait time was estimated at an hour (saturday night) and then the second wait time was half an hour. I suppose if you do go, go on a weekday instead of a weekend. Another thing was the parking issue, we drove around looking for street parking and it seemed like forever. Over all I'd definitely go here and again and I do recommend this place to other who aren't afraid of ingesting raw seafood."
191,"Great place ( warning: Super Duper Trendy) for a drink and App. We waited to sit at a high top bar table by the window. 

I found it a bit overpriced but the atmosphere and amazing company I was with made it a romantic stop on our fun night out in Portland."
192,"With a 2 hour wait and a hungry stomach, I came with a hangry mindset. Although I heard all the rave about this place, I still had low expectations for this place. The brown butter lobster roll here is beyond amazing and delicious. The buttery lobster and the perfect bread roll makes this a perfect match. This is a tiny entree for $15 but wow this is the best lobster roll I've had. The other dishes were a bit of a miss (clam chowder and oysters). Service is great and the ambiance is a little dark for a restaurant. Would definitely come back for the best lobster rolls."
193,"Amazing. Absolutely a must have if you're in Portland, ME. I came here with my sister on a whim since we were looking for restaurants nearby and noticed that this place had 2k+ reviews with 4.5 stars!!

We ordered Oysters on the Half Shell, New England Clam Chowder, and the showstopper, the New England Clam Bake. The Clam Chowder was delicious - definitely not your typical clam chowder that's super creamy, but it was much lighter with tons of flavor. The New England Clam Bake is a 'must-have' if you want your fill of seafood - it comes with steamers, mussels, lobster, potatoes, pork belly, and an egg. For two people, we were absolutely stuffed after eating this hearty meal. 

Service was super attentive and the food was delicious. I'd come back here every weekend if I lived in the area!"
194,"Overall 4.5 out of 5.

Nestled away, from the busy pier and the pricey front river restaurants sits this little unique place.  Tiny, homey, and extremely warm inside, it provides a unique setting and with excellent service of a generation that feels like it is redefining the food scene in this city.  There wasn't a single employee at this place who didn't have a genuine smile on their face when I visited it seemed.

It is abundantly clear from the start that the menu here is tailored by someone special.  Little nuances actually work, such as red onion shaved ice in your oyster plate.  A lobster stew, New England simple?  Hardly, nestled with green curry and flavors of Thai coconut it bursts with complimentary flavors.  The chowder is a little more familiar, and loaded with chunky greatness.  Squash is nestled with fish sauce, and tempura crusted fried to perfection, making the perfect vegetable like tater tot.  Blackened cod is spectacular to it's perfectly crunch skin, to it's nearly low cooked flavored almost sashimi like just over rare texture.  Fusion food this isn't, it's just smart cuisine.

The place is more a designed tapas style place, than a sequenced meal even though that's not really how it's presented.  Small plates trend once again, you will find yourself probably having to try a few to get a full meal, which can add up as well.

Overall though what is coming out of the kitchen is unique prepared with a twist that actually works and makes sense.  Someone here has the right palate going and it makes for a great experience.  Not just unique food in Portland, this is really a well done place in the U.S. period."
195,"Looks like the talk of the town was spot on. Eventide was a smash hit with quick seating and friendly service. The only downside was the small number of dinner tables, most were high seats and bar spots. Don't let that distract you from the amazing lobster rolls and bacon wrapped scallops."
196,"I feel like I was in the Twilight Zone while dining here. 2,000+ reviews and a 4.5 average rating can't be wrong... right?

Turns out they can.

First off, the wait times are ridiculous. We came several times and were quoted hour-long waits no matter what time of day it was. We also noticed big empty spots at the communal tables, but when we asked the hostess she said they wanted to give people plenty of space to eat and feel comfortable. Um... that's cool and all, but when your wait is this bad, you need to rethink that policy. We finally managed to squeeze in on a random weekday around 9 p.m. after a 30-minute wait.

The good: I got a dozen Maine oysters, four each from Blackstone Point, Wolfe's Neck, and Moshier Island, three varieties that my waitress recommended to me. My condiments of choice were the classic cocktail sauce and a more unorthodox kimchi ice (essentially that flavor in a shaved ice format). The oysters were plump and quite tasty, with a good amount of brininess and a bit of that sweet warm flavor sneaking in. These were especially nice with the cocktail sauce and a bit of that tart, pickled, refreshing flavor from the kimchi ice.

The decent: The brown butter lobster roll was pretty tasty but miniscule. I normally like that fluffy Asian bun, but here it felt too thick compared to the lobster. Speaking of which, I prefer fresher tasting and juicy lobster versus this version. My friend liked his fried oyster bun, but again, it was itty bitty.

The bad: The lobster stew was straight up salt. Ugh. I couldn't even have more than a few spoonfuls of this because I was in dire need of water. What a shame because the ingredients were nicely cooked, like the lobster and mushrooms. Hard pass on this. We also got the New England clam bake because it sounded and looked glorious. The giant dish consisted of lobster tail, steamers, mussels, salt pork, and potatoes on a bed of seaweed with drawn butter. The dish claimed to come with nori vinaigrette, but we either didn't get any or we couldn't taste it if it had been drizzled over the food. Sadly, all the seafood was dry. The mussels were especially disappointing, and considering we had really juicy, delicious steamers at J's Oyster the night before, the ones here were a major letdown. The pork was yummy, but that was about it. Not sure if this was a fluke or just an undeservedly hyped dish.

Bottom line: If you must come, do it for the oysters, but I'd steer clear of the other stuff. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere with half to no wait time. Overrated with a capital O-V-E-R... well, you get it."
197,"YUM! After getting off a 10-hour flight it was a delight to have this food. My husband picked it up & we ate it at our hotel. It was lukewarm when we got to it but it was still so delicious! Love that the lobster roll doesn't come on the traditional buttered toast. The flavor of the lobster really comes out because it's not overshadowed by the extra butter.

The Korean fried chicken bun was pretty good. I've had better at a food truck in Lynchburg, VA so obviously chicken isn't the thing the get here in Maine lol.

Ok, now let's talk about the best thing we got: THE FISH SANDWICH. Omg! I'm not a fried fish person AT ALL, like I despise any type of fish besides salmon and I NEVER eat any fried foods. But this FISH! The crust was perfectly crisp, so tender & the flavor was amazing. The sweet pickles added to the flavor and then the lettuce & tartar sauce (which I also NEVER eat) just sealed the deal. Simple, just the way I like it, but your tastebuds will def have a party. My 2 year old, who is very picky, ate just about all of it. I would say this would be something you MUST get.

Wish I actually went to the restaurant to get the ambiance & full experience, but that fish sandwich & lobster roll made up for it all."
198,"We ended up here just because we wanted a place near our hotel and it was late. I will say I'm not an oyster person and that is really what they are known for. That being said we thought what we ordered was just ok-definitely not worth all the hype I had heard and read about while researching portland. The place is tiny and the only larger tables are mostly communal. There is no place to wait unless you go to the bar, but that is also packed. We had the clam chowder soup and split the fish sandwich. Clam chowder was just ok, a little salty. The fish sandwich was also just ok, the main thing you taste is the batter. Overall to me, not worth the hype but again I did not have oysters."
199,"Worth the hype. Of course the wait is long but you go a bit early, put your name in, and grab a drink or snack elsewhere. You of course have to get the brown butter lobster rolls and then another favorite is the fried chicken sandwich. Sitting at the bar is particularly fun because you can watch the shucking of the oysters. Not a big place but big on flavor."
200,"This has become the place to get a lobster roll in Portland.  I asked around during my trip and everyone said to come here.  They were right.  This place has fantastic lobster rolls.

I really wanted to get the lobster melt since it's unique, but I couldn't resist sticking to the lobster roll.  For $19, you get a lobster roll full of fresh lobster and your choice of sauce.  I went with the jalapeno mayo.  Although had I realized they had lobster ghee, I probably would have gone with that (how can you go wrong with lobster-infused clarified butter?).

The lobster roll was excellent.  The roll was nicely buttered and toasted on the outside.  There was a lot of lobster claw meat inside.  The meat was so sweet and tender.  There was just enough lettuce to sort of have some lettuce in each bite, but not enough lettuce to take away from the lobster flavor.

I also got the small side of fries and they were great.  They were seasoned with Old Bay and super crispy.

They make unsweetened ice tea in-house, which was the perfect accompaniment to the lobster roll.

A similar lobster roll to this in Boston would cost $35.  $19 is a steal for the quality that The High Roller is serving.  Next time I come, I'll have to try the lobster melt or the lobster roll that has truffle on it."
201,"HighRoller to me is a perfect hybrid of a tourist spot in the summer and a local Saturday day hang in the winter.  

Where do I take some coworkers from out of town that have a hankerin' for some lobstah?

Where do I go when I want to meander around the Old Port on a sunny Saturday or a snowy Sunday?  (Or reverse order)

HighRoller is great lobster, great sized, portions, and a cool place to hang out with small to medium parties (no more than six - as there are only TWO tables that seat more than four).  It's a great experience for locals at a reasonable price."
202,"Very fresh lobster, and decent lobster rolls. Honestly, they weren't anything to write home about. I like to stick to the classics, so the multiple dressing options were not for me but I totally get that lots of people would love them. The lobby pops felt really gimmicky to me. I love the idea, but the execution was a little *womp*. My friend's lobby pop was just a semi-generous hunk of lobster on a wooden stick. 

The service was absolutely fabulous. The people at the counter were super friendly and accommodating despite the restaurant being really busy. I also really loved the decor! Very Instagram-friendly."
203,"Was told they have the best lobster roll in town.   It was the only one I had but it was darn good.   The amount of lobster meat in it was hefty!   They give you like 8 options of the spread to put on it. I got the garlic mayo and I would do something different.  It didn't ruin the roll, but I feel like this could make or break the roll to get it to the best roll ever 

My wife doesn't like seafood (but I still love her!) so they had some great salad and other options for thosssse people.  Great place and reasonable prices for the food."
204,"Came to the HighRoller one Friday night in mid-February and I wasn't really impressed.  I ordered the lobster roll and the popcorn lobster but for the price I was disappointed.  I liked that I could order different dressings on the side of my lobster roll and the fries were good. I have high standards for lobster rolls and next time I'm in Portland I think I will try another spot.  

I did really like the atmosphere of this place, clean and fresh - color scheme made me think of Five Guys. Same concept."
205,"Friggen FLAME. 

I'm no lobster person, and there is plenty for me to eat. Flavor of lobster 10/10 for me, texture of lobster 0/10. They were happy to accommodate the lobster bisque without lobster pieces to my liking. Strange request, I know. But texture is everything for me.

Get.the.Corn.Dog.

With the pineapple sauce. 

Oh. Em. GEE.

Yahsssss. Beer list: stacked. Food: FLAME. Service: YUHS.  

Love love love."
206,"This was a cute lobster diner which becomes a semi hipsterish in the evening with the bar and tele. The lobster rolls here where more bread than lobster but it was random who received that combo. The sauce choices with the fries were pretty good, and the lobster pops where amusing and tasty none the less.

The service is good, and the prices are pretty good.

I would recommend this place to everyone, who want to fulfill their lobster fix and have a good chill beer."
207,I do love their lobster rolls with a variety of different sauces; my only issue is that I found a piece of hair in my lobster roll. I would probably never eat here again even if the food is good because I'm afraid there'll be miscellaneous items in my food.
208,"I can definitely see why it's a popular place to go to! Don't let the name of the restaurant intimidate you, it may sound expensive but I think it's more on the end of eating like a HighRoller but at an affordable price! Not only is it affordable, but super high quality and tasty. I got the lobster melt and it was mouth watering. The breading was toasted to perfection and the combination of the lobster and cheese was an amazing combination of two tasty foods!"
209,"Doing touristy things, came here for the lobby pops.

The lobby pop is a lobster tail on 2 skewers. That's about it. Stick it in the butter and squeeze a little lemon over it. MmMmm! So good. 

We also got the fried lobby pop which is like a corn dog but replacing the hot dog with a lobster tail. I prefer the regular lobby pop. 

The fries were pretty good. 
Cole slaw... NO. Worse one I've ever had. Too bitter. Every bite was torture. We gave up on it and just set it aside. No one liked it. 
Lobster bisque was so comforting, I really enjoyed this, especially in the freezing weather. Definitely would order this again.

The place here is very laid back, the workers are really nice.

Serve your own water at the front and also order at the front when you are ready."
210,"Thumbs up to this restaurant. Everything on the menu looks delicious. They offer a variety of sauces. I ordered the Lobster Taco, which comes in a cheese shell, it was fantastic!  My husband ordered a lobster roll with butter and it was great too. If you come to Portland, you need to eat at this place."
211,"Look up the word ""average"" in the dictionary. After my picture, this restaurant will be listed. I have been here soooo many times, trying to love HighRoller. The staff and owners are great. The concept is great. The social media pages are beyond great. But I'm very confident in stating that this is perhaps the most average restaurant that I've ever been to.

Maybe last night was the final straw. Popcorn lobster for $17 consisted of five, possibly 1"" pieces of fried lobster over shoestring fries. It was barely an appetizer. And the crab dip with chips is just terrible. I've had this multiple times due to friends ordering it, and it's not a good dish. The lobster roll is fine. It's an average plus Portland lobster roll, but it isn't cheap. When Luke's Lobster opens hopefully the competition spurs improvement. The lobster grilled cheese is much better. The lobster in the cheesy shell is too salty for my taste. The best lobster restaurants get their lobster fresh off the boat in the morning and are sold out by night. HighRoller tastes like it's been sitting in a fridge for a couple days. 

The draft beer selection should be amazing but again, it's average. There are always a surprising number of beers not from Maine, when (I think) nearly all should be local. The bottle/can selection is better but most wouldn't even know it exists. The ordering process when the restaurant is busy also doesn't work well.

So I've stated the negative, but there is a lot to like. The food (besides the crab dip) is fine, especially considering there are not great alternatives for casual lobster downtown year round (though again, Luke's will change this). The staff are extremely nice, and the vibe is cool. But after a dozen visits, I'm done hoping that HighRoller will change. It is what it is. An average restaurant with a hip atmosphere and high prices. It's worth visiting, but keep your expectations in check."
212,"It's a simple restaurant with perfectly good fare in a touristy area of Portland. 

The Highburger tastes almost exactly like the Black Cow's cheeseburger but with caramelized onions. Same tasty brioche bun, maybe a slightly different meat blend. Was it good? You bet.  Do it again? Yup. 

The lobster roll with lime mayo was the real winner. Stuffed with lobstah and on genuinely perfectly toasted bun, this was light and well proportioned. Yes yes yes, we would order this again. 

The fries were shoestring style covered in Old Bay (or something similar). A basket is more than enough for two adults. 

Atmosphere was lively for a snowy, icy day. Service was in good spirits and it was pleasant all around."
213,"The heavens parted and then bestowed upon the universe a lobster roll, and it was good!
One of the best, and maybe the best lobster roll I have ever eaten. 
Why.....
1. They had 2 claws in each of our rolls
2. You get to pick your sauce, I had ghee/drawn butter, partner had signature lime mayo. Though he did prefer the one I ordered, it was also very good
3. Meat was extremely fresh, and screamed its siren sound
4. They toast the bun on all sides
5. Heady lobster roll 18$
6. They are affiliated with Bissell Bros brewery, and have delicious local ME beers on tap
7. I want another one almost immediately 
This friendly and intimate dining counter, was birthed from an epic food truck, that now has a place to call home."
214,"Whoa, I can't even begin to describe how amazing this restaurant is! I read about their lobster pops online and knew I had to try one while I was in the area. I had the fried lobster pop with a Bloody Mary (and added the lobster onto that too) and my friend had the lobster taco with a mimosa. 
First - the drinks. The Bloody Mary was perfect, absolutely perfect. It was a little expensive after adding the lobster on there but it tasted sooooo good dipped in the drink. The mimosa was average,  just not worth the $10 for the little cup of it.
Second - the food! The fried lobster pop was delicious, and the coating was amazing as well. It seemed a little undercooked but the flavor was there so I won't complain. The lobster taco was better than I imagined it would be. The shell was cheese, fried cheese! How much better can it get! And the portion of meat on there was awesome as well. We got a cup of fries to split and they were coated in old bay, or something similar, and I couldn't get enough of them."
215,"Simple menu with Great Lobster Roll and Shoestring French Fries! 

There are several options on the sauces. I picked the butter and lime mayo. I did not care for the Lime Mayo, it kind of tasted like a  warm and salty key lime pie. I am glad I also ordered the butter, It made the lobster roll very yummy!"
216,Lobstah lobstah! Highly recommend the lobstah rolls here! Also definitely get the popcorn lobster off the secret menu!
217,"The best lobster roll I have tried. The restaurant is clean, fresh, and has a kind of hipster ""diner in a movie"" feel to it. 

The waiter was very nice, and helped us decide, he even offered to get the lobster roll cut in half and warmed up for us. The food came quickly, and you could tell they use fresh ingredients. 

I highly recommend that you stop by if you are in the area."
218,"Great place! We had the Lobster roll, lobster Bisque and the Fried Lobby Pop, all good choices!  Get the lime mayo!"
219,"Its hard to describe this place quickly. Short menu consists of a hand full of lobster choices, burger and dogs. Most of menu is for the booze/ beer. Think of it as a trendy hamburger joint that specializes in lobster and you'll get an accurate picture. Complete with bar seating. I order a burger with lobster...Surf and Turf. I thought the lobster came as a kicker- nope, right on top of burger. It was unexpected, but so good. Had it with a garlic mayo sauce. Wife had lobster roll with drawn butter she said was good. We shared a rum bucket. Good, but not as big as it sounds. Kids had dogs and Yoo-hoo's. The tab though...jeez. Walked in a high roller, walked out a broke baller. To be expected for
Lobster, just shocked with hot dogs were involved. Will save up and come again though."
220,"Hands down impressive lobster grilled cheese sandwich! And the lobster roll was so so good too! 

We went to HR for a nice lobster roll and I got distracted by the lobster grilled cheese. No doubt, it was sooo good! Lots of lobster meat and nicely toasted/ grilled bread. 

The price was good and the retro decor in this place makes it an unforgettable meal in Portland ME. Don't forget to take a photo with the guy who waited too long for his orders! :)"
221,"We loved our trips to the HighRoller. I ate so many lobster rolls during our Maine trek, I made a list and ranked them. HR's was #2. Standard, no frills but modern ambiance. Order at the counter and wait for the massive roll to arrive. It was fairly dead during the weekdays but it was slammed on the weekends. 

I guess it's fun to put a variety of sauces on lobster but I liked it the simple way with butter poured on top. Divine. Seriously. We only got to try one lobby pop because they only had three left and were limiting one per party. It was good but wished we had more! They have secret menu items on their IG but i only saw the lobster popcorn bites. Also good! I will say i was unimpressed with the lobster ghee topping. I have no clue what it was supposed to be like but all i tasted was nothing. I saw some people with salads but I assumed they didn't know better. To each his own. 

Don't think twice about stopping here!"
222,"A must visit for an amazing lobster roll!!  Buttery, toasty roll on the outside and bursting with generous chunks of lobster inside -- no celery added as a filler.  A small bit of lettuce on the bottom is just the right touch of greens for crunch.  Interesting selection of condiments (red pepper or jalapeño mayo) add a new taste to a first-rate roll.  Cute place with friendly service and a nice selection of beer/wine, too.  My new go-to for lobster rolls in Portland."
223,"I love how simple the lobster roll is here! No frills, no butter, na da....just your toasted buns, piled high with meat and small piece of lettuce and just eat.  I got to taste the freshness and sweetness of the lobster and thats all i ask for in life

I like how i can choose the sauces on the side and since i am a fan of curry ketchup, i had to get it!  My friends got the lime mayo and i had to try the lobster ghee.  All of them were delicious!"
224,"I had to try a Lobster roll to get the full ""Maine Experience"", and this is one of the top rated places in the area. The Lobster roll was okay, but nothing too special. I feel like it was over-priced in comparison to some of their other competitors."
225,"We have been waiting for an opportunity to check out Highroller Lobster Co. for quite some time, and today was the perfect day to do it! It's Sunday before the Super Bowl and a perfect time to skip lines and waits at the popular places in town. We decided to try their famous Lobster Roll with Lime Mayo, the Lobster Cheese Crisp Taco and an item from their secret menu, the Lobster Poutine fries. I have had many lobster roll but none quite as fresh, tasty and tender as Highroller's. Although there's not a ""right"" way of having a lobster roll (hot vs. cold), Highroller's was just the right cool temperature for us. The Lobster Taco was creative, crunchy and didn't flake apart like we thought it would. And the poutine was just right and not overwhelming. We'll have to stop by again the next time we have a big appetite and try their other offerings!"
226,"Different lobster rolls, but we loved it! I got a lobster roll with the jalapeno mayo! So good! Really cool atmosphere with a good beer list!"
227,"HighRoller is a MUST-STOP restaurant when you're in Portland. They serve the most unique, while still delicious, takes on lobster rolls/dishes along with a fantastic beer list (no doubt due to the fact that they are business partners with Bissell Brothers).

The cheese shell lobster taco is out of this world, the fries come piping hot with whatever dipping sauce you crave (the limo mayo is divine), and the classic lobster roll with lobster ghee is DYN-O-MITE.

Don't leave without trying a whoopie pie...or at least take it home with you - as you'll no doubt be too full to eat it after your lobster feast!"
228,"Do you have to be a high roller to eat at HighRoller?  Well, even though lobster rolls look humble -- it's a sandwich after all -- the answer is maybe.  Lobster rolls ain't cheap but they're good.

I want someone to invent the lobster panini: less bread, more lobster."
229,"This is a basic no-frills place to grab a Maine lobster roll. And beer. Beer too.

I say ""Maine"" lobster roll because I'm from Connecticut and Connecticut lobster rolls are typically hot. Maine lobster rolls are typically cold. That's in general of course because exceptions exist in either state.

I liked my lobster roll. It didn't have a lot of mayonnaise. It contained a very very light coating of mayonnaise. Different sauces are available to accompany the lobster roll. I selected the lime mayo sauce and it was very good.

The bun was a little oversized but the lettuce wedge was a nice touch. We don't get lettuce wedges on our lobsters rolls in Connecticut.

French fries were very good as well.

The interior decor is somewhat similar to Five Guys, with lots of small red checker patterns scattered all over the place.

By the way, the restroom is somewhat interesting. It contains a cool looking rolling-track type door. I've seen them in old factories before, but I've never seen them covering an entire restroom."
230,"Stopped here for lunch on the way back to the airport from points north. Easy to find, pay parking on the street.

I had a beer T-shirt on, so they rushed over with the tap menu! Party points for paying attention!
 
Small but interesting local tap list. LOTS of sours and Belgians in bottles of you like that sort of thing. 

We each ordered a lobster roll with the red pepper sauce. They were PERFECT! Flavorful lobster on a fresh toasted roll. Split a cup of fries - they are the shoestring kind with Old Bay. Not bad, but I prefer the thicker ones. 

Bartender was super friendly and let me taste a few beers even after we were done eating. 

I grabbed a whoopie pie at the counter and it was MARVELOUS!!! Dark chocolate bourbon pecan caramel or something like that!!! OMG. Would go back just for that!

Highly recommend!!"
231,"After trying a few different lobster rolls on our first visit to Maine, I was completely confused as to why anybody liked them - until trying HighRoller. 

What I LOVE about Highroller is that they make it so easy to customize your lobster roll and add yummy flavors that compliment the taste of the lobster. I guess that probably the main reason lobster rolls are typically so simple is to not distract from the lobster? Well, I personally think that's dumb. And they're boring that way. 

Highroller gives you tons of toppings and sauce options, which makes the taste of lobster (which is super fresh and delicious, by the way) pop and adds some tasty bulk to the roll as a whole. We opted for some fresh avocado and a combo of jalapeño and lime mayos. Absolute heaven. 

If you're looking for a top notch lobster roll in Portland, I wouldn't recommend anywhere else but Highroller!"
232,"Best lobster roll I've ever had. I got it with the lobster ghee and it was fantastic. Despite the roll being chock full of lobster meat I still felt inclined to get the lobby pop, which was also awesome. You can't go wrong with meat on a stick, especially when you get to drown said meat in warm butter. 

I'm not a beer person but my husband is. He said that they had a great selection of extremely rare craft beer and New England IPAs. I can only speak to their coca cola, which came in a cool glass bottle.

I don't know if there is a heaven or what it looks like but I do hope it is a HighRoller Lobster."
233,"Everything here is pretty phenomenal. It's our go-to place to take out of town guests who want something lobster. Great classic Maine lobster roll. Love that you can get different flavors of mayo on it. The fried cheese shell lobster taco is so different than anything I've had. It's rich -- we split one, and I'm not sure I could eat a whole one -- but delicious. The fries with Old Bay seasoning are shoe-stringy goodness. 

The biggest surprise? This is my favorite burger in Portland. The big slab of melty, delicious havarti cheese on a perfectly juicy burger is to die for. Try it with the jalepeño mayo!"
234,"HighRoller is a must try. Not your traditional Maine, side of the road lobster roll. There are a ton of aiolis to choose from. I got the lobster taco - which I didn't love. The cheese shell was difficult to bite into and made for a messy meal. My fiancé got the lobster grilled cheese which was fantastic. Great local craft brew selection. Definitely stop by if you're in the mood for a new age lobster roll in a retro environment."
235,"The Quick: Now that's a lobster roll! Pair it with a cup (big portion) of shoe string fries to split and a fancy dipping sauce and you're golden! Not worth crazy waits but sneak in and sit at the bar if you can. Lots of local beer on draft! 

The Details: I'm a simplest- lobster roll with drawn butter, done. Perfect. If you like new things, you can try it with all types of different mayo. I personally kept the lobster roll classic and tried to sauces on the fries which was amazing! Highly recommend! 

The Damage: Average for lobster I'm Boston. Not cheap but amazing portion size"
236,"As a local, I have less appetite for lobster, but wanted to try a new spot in town. I went in on a lunch break, ordered a Burger Medium-cooked, and received instead a rare patty that wasn't cooked through in the middle. They spent 10 minutes preparing my burger (more than enough time to make it medium), and then had the audacity to serve me a raw patty, without checking it! I won't be returning here.

I spent $11 on a hamburger that I couldn't even eat. In the future, I will stick with Five Guys, just down the road, for future burger cravings, as I can get a burger for just $5 or $6 and know its cooked through."
237,"This was my first legit lobster roll! I love lobster so much! This joint gets super crowded, especially on the weekends. My bf and I were here for lunch on a Sunday and the wait was around 45 minutes. Good thing its in downtown Portland so leave your number, walk around and they'll call you when a seat opens up. So the ordering is a little confusing at first. You actually get a table, look at the menu and then get back up to order at the counter up front. They give you a number and bring the food to you. 

To keep things real I just got a lobster roll with butter. The roll came out filled to the brim with lobster!!! I took the first bite and all I got was lobster (YAAAY)! It's huge chunks of lobster too, not your shredded chewed up lobster that I saw in pictures sometimes. The meat was so fatty, but not as sweet as some of the lobster I had later on in our trip. My bf got the lobster with lime mayo, which I liked too but I just love the classic combo of butter and lobster. Oh and I have to rave about the buns. It's like a thick folded buttery piece of toast. It's like eating butter on butter on lobster and more butter. I love butter....anyways, loved this place and if I lived in Portland I'd go bankrupt eating here. 

Oh yeah we also got fries, they were fries. LOBSTER!"
238,"When in Maine the lobster choices seem to be endless. Our hotel shuttle driver recommended high roller. Apparently they used to work off of a street cart and now have a shop. We walked in on a Monday night with two non lobster eating kids and hoped for the best. 

And the best it was! The place is super cook and trendy. You order but food is brought to you. Thee are red fluorescent lobster lights which contrast a very clean, sleek white tile atmosphere.  The music was pumping and my husband appreciated the bartenders Replacements selections which is not something you often encounter. 

The beer selection is impressive. Lots of local beers and not just Allagash/ Shipyard. I had a sour saison which was incredible. 

We had lobster rolls and they were prefect. I disagree with other helpers and think they were totally worth the price tag. There was a great amount of tender lobster on a nice toasted roll. You could choose from a variety of different sauces to top it with but for the first time stuck with drawn butter. The fries were delicious! Light and not greasy at all. Tasted like classic McDonald's old school style. My kids loved them. My son had a cheeseburger which was also phenomenal. Great blend of beef. We also had a hot dog ( kids, remember?) and it was surprisingly good as well. They don't just do lobster! 

We liked High Roller so much..... we went back the next night!!! Yes, in Portland with so many food options we ate here twice. It's THAT good."
239,"Great place to grab a quick bite and drink.  Service was fast and efficient and staff themselves were fantastic.

First time in Maine and just roaming around Portland, heard a lot about this place.  Everywhere lobster/crab rolls right, not saying I did not enjoy every place did I did get a lobster or crab roll, but just wanted something different.  Different indeed is what I got.  Came in for the lobster grilled cheese.  Simple, but sooo good!  Bread itself was flaky and just the right enough of cheese and lobster to not overwhelm.  

Highly recommend."
240,"Here is the 3-1-1: 

Food: For that late-night lobster roll craving this is great place to hit up. Got the lobster roll with spicy mayo and it was good but that sweet Maine lobster was not there, however the bun was toasted nicely and the meat to bread ratio was decent. For dessert HR has homemade woopie pies and the Malibu rum coconut flavored one was a must try and it was decadent, a little lite on the rum but there were hints of coconut. HR also has a great beer selection, not necessarily a good pairing with lobster or woopie pies but still tasty local brews.

Service: Super friendly and fast on getting your drink and food orders especially when sitting at the bar. 

Ambiance: Cool vibe, very loungy and definitely a great spot and hang out."
241,"If you enjoy lobster, this place may be lobster heaven. You will find an array of lobster dishes here. I stuck with the classic of getting a lobster roll along with a cold, Maine brew. They serve a variety of sauces as well. Fries were your average shoe string fries."
242,"I mean...anything with lobster gets me excited, so I was eager to try out HighRoller for quite some time, especially since they have become a staple in Portland for their unique spins on lobster classics. 

My mom, husband and I decided to come here one day for lunch. Thinking that it would be incredibly busy around noontime, it was surprisingly quiet, which was nice. When walking in, HighRoller has that diner feel with the red and white aesthetic and the long bar with various booths throughout the venue. It adds to the casual-ness of the food and experience, which is something that I enjoyed. 

The hostess gave us menus and told us that we could sit wherever we wanted and that we could come back up and order when we were ready. HighRoller has a variety of options ranging from lobster grilled cheese, typical lobster rolls, lobster cheese taco, etc. I ended up ordering the lobster in a cheese taco with Jalapeño mayo, while my mom and husband opted for the lobster grilled cheese. We also ordered a bucket of fries to share as a table and I got a frosé. 

Our drinks were quick to come out first. My frosé was good, but it almost seemed watered down. I've had better, but it was good. Our meals were also quick to come out. My lobster taco had a good amount of lobster in it, and the cheese taco was to. die. for. I also liked how they have a variety of sauces you can put on your lobster, and the jalapeño mayo was a perfect zesty addition! The fries were shoe-string cut, and perfectly crunchy and seasoned with cajun seasoning. 

We ended our time with some homemade whoopie pies. I got the whoopie pie with raspberry filling and it was incredibly moist and so, so good.

Overall, I really like what HighRoller has to offer and I would certainly bring people from out of town here to try some unique and elevated lobster eats!"
243,"So sooo good! We got the lobster roll, taco, fries and bisque. The taco was our favorite, we got it with the lime mayo.. the jalapeño mayo was so good with the fries"
244,"Terrible service. I ordered the lobster bisque but they didn't pack my order to go. Don't come here since they can't keep up with service on a regular Sunday 8 pm. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed. 

Grilled cheese lobster has no cheese pull. They tossed one of my sandwich in. Complete lack of care for food. 
 Food: 3/5 
Service: 0/5

Maybe they will be better on a weekday at a non Rush hour time. Who knows? I wouldn't come back for it. There are better places that provide better food and service than this place. Hopefully you will find something you like about this place but for me it is a miss."
245,"I don't know if it's the best lobster roll in town or not but it was top shelf. Big fresh meaty chunks of sweet lobster meat on a tasty butter roll. Given choice of two sauces, out of an impossible dozen choices. I went for the butter and jalapeño mayo. Muy bueno is all I can say. A great combo. 

Shared a basket of old bay fries and I asked for the garlic mayo as my dip. First off, the fries were the best OB fries ever. I live in Maryland and have a tattoo of an Old Bay can on my arse, believe me. Dipped into a nicely balanced garlic mayo and you have a double dose of yum.

Great tap choices. A glass of Ultramarine will cure what ails ya.

A for sure return next time."
246,"This place was recommended to me by a coworker when I was visiting Portland for a weekend. We loved it! The wait was definitely long as it's not a big restaurant, but it was worth it. The roll was awesome, the lime mayo was delicious. My friend had the grilled cheese lobster melt and it was awesome. They have at least eight different sauce options for the rolls and fries, which are shoestring and delicious. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Portland!"
247,"I came to Portland looking to try their take on New England lobster rolls and this was our first stop. I was sadly disappointed. They have a multitude of lobster rolls with different sauces to add in top. The establishment has a old school 50's diner feel to it with their red and white checkerboard tiles. 

The lobsters itself was nice- big lobster chunks (I gave them a star for that) but the flavor of the lobsters were completely overshadowed and overpowered by the overwhelming flavor of their buttered roll. The rolls was almost doused in butter. Holding the roll left my hand very oily. It made my experience... not too pleasant.

Parking- could find it in the area- may have to walk a few blocks to get here

Cleanliness-  very clean

Service- came to get my order and got me my check with satisfactory/ just below satisfactory timing.

Love it or dump it?
Dump it- would not recommend"
248,"Came here just to try their cold lobster rolls on my quest to find a good roll. I did not disappointed. It was the first time finding a decent size roll. Of course, the cold and hot roll are different in taste, but this roll was good quality. You also get to choose what kind of sauce you want on your roll. I did the lime mayo and it was just the perfect tanginess needed. The fries were hot and crispy and the old bay seasoning went perfect with them. 

It can be confusing when you arrive. You get seated and then when you're ready to order, you must go to the counter. then someone brings you your food when it's ready. The whole process was pretty fast."
249,"This place was AWESOME!! Best Lobster roll I have ever tried. The lobster ""chowder"" was not what I expected. Wasn't bad, just wasn't what I expected. I thought it would either be NE Clam Chowder style (with lobster) or else traditional lobster bisque (it was neither). Very Sherry based and not as sweat or creamy as I expected. Again, not bad, just not as expected.

Ambience in the restaurant was great. We sat at the bar and shot the breeze with the owners father (nice guy! Go Broncos!!). Bar has 7 or 8 beers on tap and they are all excellent local craft taps, including a high end Bissell Bro's always on tap! We came at noon on a Saturday in the summer (hightime) but there was a healthy wait to sit down, so plan ahead. 

Definitely recommend!!!"
250,"i don't even know how much i spent on lobster rolls or seafood on my road trip across the east coast... too afraid to check.. lol
however, seeing that this place serves up lobster grilled cheese, i had to check it out.

we ended up getting the lobster roll and lobster grilled cheese.
I wish i came here with more people, so we could've got more items.
i also wanted to try the fried lobster pop, and the lobster taco... but the two entrees we got were solid.  the lobster grilled cheese was heavenly, the way the cheese collided with the lobster meat was a refreshing change to how we normally ate lobster rolls on our east coast trip.  they also give you choices to add a sauce to the side of your dish.  i believe you can request more for free.  just ask the people working there which sauce goes well with what. i liked the lime mayo, it added a nice kick to the lobster dishes. 

there's no dedicated parking, so you have to find street parking or park in the structure around the corner...they don't valet parking...

i believe if you sit at the bar, you don't need to wait, but if you want table or booth seats, you'll have to wait for a hostess."
251,"Lobster is always a must when in Maine. However, when in Portland in particular, the high roller must be added to your list of culinary adventures. The signage outside is eye catching, although parking can be scarce. When you walk in the order counter is right there. The menu is posted and you order your food before you get seated. Some of the highlights beside the fabulous lobster roll, are the multitude of dipping sauces and tasty craft beers. I ordered my lobster roll with a side of jalapeño mayo and it did not disappoint. The staff here is great and very friendly. Overall, I'd definitely love to come back next time I'm in the area!"
252,"This place was semi-fast food style. You order and pay in the front, and the waiter brings you your food. Inside was decorated like a diner, and it was located pretty centrally. We came here after checking out different places that had too long of a wait time. 

I ordered the lobby pop, which was a lobster tail, and some fries. They were pretty good, but it was so greasy, I felt nauseous at the end... My friend ordered the lobster burger which looked amazing, and my other friends got the lobster grilled cheese and lobster roll. They all thought it was pretty good but too greasy. It was also pretty overpriced. The other lobster restaurant that we originally wanted to go to was more reasonably priced, but the lobby pop, which was a small lobster tail, was $10. All other entrees were about $20, which was not worth the amount of food they give you. According to our Uber driver who is from the area, all seafood restaurants are pretty much the same, so I would go somewhere else, unless the wait time was significantly shorter like this time."
253,Love the whole vibe here. We sat at the bar for wine and lobster. Lobster mac n cheese and a lobster roll. We had a small order of fries. Not a fan of the fry. Overly seasoned and not hot enough when they are delivered.
254,I'm not telling you they have the best lobster roll in the world but it's probably better than your favorite.
255,"Okay, they get one star for now. 


Update. 
Looks like the staff was not up to date on happy hour at night. 

1st happy hour. Great. 5$ corn dogs and Margs.
2nd happy hour. Turned off the fryer, so no corn dogs, and charged me full price for my margaritas. 

Only reason they get 1 start is because I emailed and they didn't get back to me.

Weak."
256,Well after a year on my list of places I have been looking to try I finally made it here. The food is just as amazing as the Instagram pictures. My son told me about this place and once I saw their Instagram pics I knew I had to try it. I had the classic lobster roll. It was excellent. Roll done perfectly and lobster nice and sweet . My guy got the lobster taco. So so good and gluten free too! ( not an option for him) . The French fries had a nice seasoning to them and the coleslaw was great. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable . Oh did I forget the margarita? It was great. All fresh ingredients. No nasty sour mix. Bloody Mary's were great too. We will definitely be back .
257,"I got so many recommendations to come to HighRoller when I came to Portland that we made it our first stop. Even at 3 PM, we had to wait for over an hour for a table.

HighRoller serves Instagram worth lobster rolls. My boyfriend and I both got the lobster roll ($19), which comes with a brioche bun, romaine lettuce, lobster, and a choice of sauce. I got the honey dijonaisse, and he got the charred pineapple mayo. 

The pineapple mayo was much better than the honey dijonaisse, but overall, I wasn't super impressed with my lobster roll, especially since you can get one on nearly every menu in this area. I thought the lobster had a very mild flavor, and we only got a few pieces of lobster. Perhaps since it was later in the day, we didn't get as much or as good of lobster. 

Perhaps my experience was unique, but there are better lobster rolls to be had in Portland. Skip the wait!"
258,"Visited from out of state to try a lobster roll.

Staff was awesome, great customer service, made us feel welcome.

Food was promptly made.

Got the lobster roll with lime garlic and jalapeños. Delicious. The brioche bun was the right amount of bread.

Would totally go back again. Thank you!"
259,"Apparently they used to be a food truck but now a bonafide bar on Exchange St in downtown Portland ME! Beer $6 (16 oz) was very good, for me bu hey am not a big beer drinker. I ordered this sour mango flavor with only 3.7 alcohol per content so was perfect for moi!

Hubby had an IPA he said was okay he had better. But the lobster roll $19 was very sweet $ fresh. Fries $5 was tasty and crispy! Probably a one off for us for there are lots just like this place serving lobsta roll just as well if not better."
260,"OMG, the Lobster Roll was fabulous!  Very fresh and flavorful.  I really cannot add any more accolades that have not already been stated in previous reviews.  Just go, for a wonderful, memorable meal! 
It can be very crowded, even at non-traditional peak times, but if you're willing to sit at the comfortable bar, it can be easier and quicker to be served."
261,"Best bang for your buck when it comes to lobster roll spots in this area. 

When you order your lobster roll, they ask you to pick a sauce which is nice. We went with the butter. The lobster roll was sweet, flavorful, and filling. Just what we were looking for. 

Our friends had the cheese taco with lobster, and that was interesting. The cheese overpowered the lobster though, I thought. But still interesting and worth a try. 

Awesome beer on tap, too. I'd love to return."
262,Roll with the Jalepeno Mayo was excellent. Bun was perfectly toasted and add a Battery Steel Stout and those delicious seasoned fries..... One hell of a lunch.
263,"I never thought I would ever utter these words, but the lobster roll at HighRoller had almost TOO much lobster for me. I take that back: it would have been the perfect meal if I had come in ravenously hungry, not having eaten all day, but I made the unfortunate (or wonderful) decision to have a Belleville croissant that day for breakfast so I wasn't in top eating form. 

The roll is enormous, with double the amount of lobster I see at most lobster roll places. You can choose your sauce to go on top or on the side, and I went with the lobster ghee, which made the whole thing even more decadent. 

I also got a cup of fries on the side, with which you can select two additional sauces (I went with the curry ketchup and lime mayo) on the side. I'm not sure if it was Old Bay or some other kind of seasoning on the fries, but I liked that it was subtle and gave it a little kick beyond your basic fries. 

Next time I think I might try the lobster taco, whose shell is made of crispy cheese instead of a tortilla (!) 

As for the experience overall, the interior is spacious and clean if a bit sterile, and though I initially got some confusing instructions on ordering and seating from the uninterested hostess, the guys behind the bar and serving the food were really nice and engaged. 

There's a reason why this place has gotten so much buzz, both when it was a cart and now in its brick and mortar location. They know what they're doing when it comes to lobster, and any lobster fan will definitely find something to make their lobstery dreams come true."
264,"Usually love this spot but staff seems they need to learn how to operate a restaurant. Turning away a customer that wants to pay for a take out order because there's ""other customers waiting"" is a lost opportunity. Sometimes customers like myself don't have time to wait for a table then put in a food order. Wonder how much money this restaurant has missed out of due to this staff member. I will be second guessing my usual go to spot for lobster now"
265,"We had the crab rolls with red pepper, ghee, lime, garlic mayo sauces along with the small side of fries. SO DELICIOUS!! The brioche bun was crispy and fresh, and the crab was tender and sweet! The seasoning on the fries makes them tasty. I think they even add seasoning in the ketchup which makes it better. Highly recommended!"
266,It was the first lobster roll I ever had in my life and I had it here! Congrats to High Roller on that! Haha. Giant chunks of fresh lobster on buttered roll and awesome fries to go with it. I think I did good by waiting to not settle for a lobster roll outside of Maine in another state and I also did good by coming here.
267,"This place was amazing. Had to do the classic Lobster Roll and it was everything I thought it would be. Fresh, fresh, fresh. If I come again, I'm definitely trying the lobster grilled cheese :drool: I also had the Berry Berry Berry Good beer and it was berry good - recommend! Of course I'm a fry freak and I got fries along with my roll and I lovedddd the spice they put on it. 

Tip: Don't wait for a table. If you're by yourself or a party of 2, head to the bar and you can order food there too! 

They also were playing Land Before Time movies on repeat, which made me nostalgic for my childhood, haha"
268,Most excellent. Get the whoopie pie and a lobster roll. Then finish it all with a lobster grilled cheese. Don't forget the mayo.
269,The perfect place to grab a quick bite. Friendly service and great lobster rolls with a variety of toppings. They also have a large variety of local beers!
270,Loved everything!!  My boyfriend and I were in Portland Maine it the night and I wanted a lobster roll. Everything was delicious the lobster was fresh and I loved the sauces and the fries and the service was excellent!! I was very impressed with the bartenders.  We will be back!
271,Let me start out by saying this place has pretty cool workers. They were super friendly and helpful. Now to the food. We started out with the crab dip and chips. Wow! The dip had this awesome kick to it. Highly recommend getting it. We both got the lobster taco. The taco shell is made out of straight up cheese. It was delicious. The lobster was so fresh. We both got the butter sauce since we came to Maine to eat the lobster not some sauce. I really like the lobster but it was kinda hard to eat the taco. Ended up eating just half of the shell. Devoured the lobster tho . I don't think you can go wrong with any of their food. Also FYI there is a secret menu. Popcorn lobster is one of the secret items.
272,"Reviews brought us here, and they did not disappoint. Great location in central Portland, and great place to start your day. You walk in and can smell the fresh lobster as it hits you in the face. Service was phenomenal, both being seated and at the bar where we ordered. The atmosphere was bright and friendly. Drinks and food came out quick and efficient. I had the Bloody Mary, which had a nice kick and was definitely different than the average Bloody Mary. The real kicker was the lobster though. You come to Maine and hope to find good lobster, you come to a lobster based restuarant and hope to find good lobster, and all your hopes are met with reality. Juicy, delicious, and worth every penny. You also have to try the lobster ghee (clarified butter). Basically, trust the reviews here, it's 100% worth it."
273,I've had plenty of lobster rolls. Especially on our northeast roadtrip. But I absolutely loved this one. I went with the classic and it was delicious. Staff was so nice! I definitely will be back to try all the other options! My friend had the lobster bisque and it looked amazing
274,"I'm originally a Maine native who now lives in Texas for the past 12 years. I have been excited to try this place ever since I saw it on the food network and was finally able to partake the other day. I ordered the Lobster Taco with the spicy mayo on top.  The cheese crisp taco was interesting and had a nice flavor with the lobster.  My only disappointment was the spicy mayo as I personally felt that it did not add that ""zing"" I was hoping for, otherwise the staff was nice and atmosphere was kind of a retro hipster Maine diner feel."
275,"Burger tasty
Fries over seasoned
Service slow but friendly.
Price a little high
Atmosphere is busy 
Noise level pretty high"
276,"Great atmosphere and selection of lobster dishes. Loved this place. Go for brunch and order the avocado toast with lobster, and lime sauce on the side. Amazing way to start the day."
277,"Great hipster joint in Old Port. The vibe is casual and the food is excellent. Husband got a lobster roll and I tried the lobster taco. The taco shell is made entirely out of a Parmesan crisp. Um, brilliant!! The saltiness of the cheese brings out the fresh sweetness of the lobster chunks, all of which is elevated by the fragrant drawn butter. We finished dinner with a chocolate whoopie pie with marshmallow cream. Sooo good!!"
278,"True to online reviews, they have one of the best lobster rolls and fries in Maine.  I was quite excited and curious to try their cuisine after reading so many people describe their food with such joy online.  I just had to see what the hype was all about.  The wait was quite long as it was lunch time when we went, but I was far from disappointed with my experience.  The food was worth the wait.

I was quite puzzled and surprised when they directed us to a glass water dispenser filled with tap water after asking for a glass of water.  It turns out, the water in Portland is cleaner and taste better than most. 

I loved how casual, yet popular Highroller was.  It was definitely a local, as well as a tourist favorite.  We didn't get the chance to meet the owners, which I heard were really nice, and friendly, but perhaps next time.  If you're in Portland, definitely give it a try!"
279,"Hands down my favorite lobster roll in Maine. I'm bowled over by the cheesy crisp taco shell lobster roll with lime mayo. The fries and ketchup are easy eats and a little addictive, but my guilty pleasure is the red snapper corn dog. It's perfect! Lastly, I'm a fan of the guys who own it, who are just lovely and deserving of their continued success."
280,"The environment is fabulous, with apropos decor and the ""little things"" is what makes this such a great experience! 
Kudos to the young men who got this rolling... literally! 
There is no outdoor dining, but the FRESH, tender, delicious lobster! There are a couple gluten free options and if you don't eat lobster, other options can be found (burger, salad).
I had the grilled cheese taco lobster roll ... delish!! (I've always loved baked on cheese anyway!) My companion had the regular lobster roll and we had coleslaw and each tried two different dressings/dips.
We liked the lobster ghee, charred pineapple, lime mayo...ever so lightly. The honey dijon completely masked the flavor of the lobster, neither of us cared for it. 
The coleslaw was very tasty and not too sharp or sweet. Will definitely return again soon!
Note: You are given a seat and menus. Look at the menu and then go back to the front desk to order and pay for food. Then you have a flag on your table and food is delivered promptly and with a smile. Service is very good!"
281,"This place was a pleasant surprise. We wanted to eat as much lobster as possible in our trip to Maine, but were expecting most of the places right in Portland to be touristy or overpriced for lobster. This place was great. The interior is like an In-n-Out burger for lobster. The menu is fun - we tried the lobster grilled cheese and lobster bisque. The bisque was ok - it could have had a bit more lobster in it. The grilled cheese was very good. They also serve a great selection of sour beer, which my boyfriend was very excited about and is unique. 
I would definitely return to this place if back in Portland."
282,"Very very tasty. Great service, great energy...good food. Not great for groups, but certainly up to six. 
The burger with lobster was exceptional! The lobster was actually seasoned - and well.,"
283,"We stopped by and gave this place a shot today; however, left underwhelmed.   Don't get me wrong, there was nothing bad, but this place has some work to do if they want to be considered a top 5 lobster roll in Portland.  My primary complaint was the roll had more bread and lettuce than lobster.  

On the positive, the sauces and fries were enjoyable and the staff friendly. If you are in the area, give this place a shot."
284,"Fantastic. Service, atmosphere and lobster was perfect. I had the lobster roll with jalapeno mayo. Perfection. Wahed down with a local IPA and great conversation with people at the bar and the bartender. Good times. 

We also had fries with Old Bay. Solid."
285,"First off, I just want to say that I have no pictures from here because we just downed our food.. shows you how delicious it was! Hahah sorry not sorry!

This was our 3rd and last stop for our lobster fest. And it couldn't have been better. Set out in the prime location of shopping, the interior of this establishment was quite nostalgic!

We ordered lobster tail on a stick and cheese crisp lobster taco. The cheese crisp was the taco shell and inside just pure lobster meat with whatever sauces we wanted on it. Hooooooly moly my stomach was blessed. I don't even have any other words to describe this eatery. Go ahead and go for yourselves!"
286,"My God in Heaven if you want a lobster roll, go here. They are expensive but for the amount of lobster that you get it's about par for the course if not a good value. And, although I've lived in Maine all my life I haven't had many lobster rolls because I have a thing for mayonnaise.....as in a ""wish it didn't exist"" thing. HighRoller gives you a variety of options in terms of the dressing for your lobster and I always get the hot ghee, problem solved! The environment it funky and they have a healthy selection of solid local brews/ciders to go with your lobster. This place is ON POINT."
287,"Came because of the high reviews but thoroughly disappointed.  The lobster rolls are overpriced and the lobster meat were frozen.  Even if I had expected frozen lobster meat, I wish it would've been presented as less frozen at the very least. A total lack of effort, and the meat tasted like it was directly taken outta the freezer and only warmed up from the warmer sauce.  

The bread bowl lobster bisque is just as bad.

If possible I'd give my experience a solid 1.5 stars. 
Horrible food (limited menu options)
Horrible line up/ordering logistic
(Everyone cram clog up the entrance to order)
Maybe the drinks are good 
And I definite take responsibility for not reading the menu as well before hand 
AND 
not realizing that this is a bar joint not a restaurant."
288,"I don't know how I feel about cold lobster rolls. I'm from Connecticut. We typically serve the lobster rolls warm, on buttered bread, with more butter. Do you like butter? I hope so. Cause you're about to eat a lot of butter.

But I like to think of myself as an open-minded guy, you know. So I figure, I'll give this a whirl. I want a proper Maine lobster roll, and I don't have time to wait two hours for Eventide, so let's do this.

I was a little confused as to how it operates, as I'd sat down to look at the menu, but took me a minute to realize I needed to get up and order. No problem.

I got a lobster roll with lime mayo and a coffee.

The lobster roll came out so fast I felt like maybe they had been reading my thoughts. Which is fine. Sorry about the weird shit, but you were in there, you know.

I gotta say, I dig the mayo. I think it might be a better choice than butter. I don't know. 

But I stand fast that hot lobster is better than cold lobster. Heat that shit up, Maine. Try it. Just heat it up with the mayo. Let's compromise. See what happens. I think you're gonna like it.

The coffee was okay. If that matters to you. Which it should not. It was just a little weird having finished my food and sitting there drinking coffee and watching Godfather II. No idea if that's what they always watch. Weirdos."
289,"Heard this was a fairly new spot and we decided to check it out for lunch. There was an hour wait on a weekday but the hostess gave us a pager which had a block radius and said to come back a little before our ETA. There are a bunch of cute shops on this block so we walked around and checked them out. We came back within the hour and were called in. 
They seat you but make you get up to place your order at the counter and you get a number to bring back to your table so the staff can bring the food to you when ready. I in general loathe this kind of half service. Either be like Panera or not...but I digress.. Our drinks and food came fairly quickly and looked good enough but it was just ok (got the lobster roll and a lobster grilled cheese).. there are way better places in the Old Port / Downtown area to check out. Given the hour wait, I'd chalk this up to it being a new place / tourist season. I would def not wait an hour for a lobster roll again."
290,"This place isn't bad at all. I dig that they have the different sauces for their lobster rolls as I haven't seen many places do this at all. It adds some good flavor (jalopeno mayo - yes pleeeeeeeease). Service wasn't bad, and the orders came out within 15 min or so. 

For the price, we probably could have gotten a bit more portion wise elsewhere. We've been to places where the rolls come with a side a fries and slaw and a drink with free refills all for $20. This place is ala carte. $19 bucks for the roll, another $6 for fries, and $3 for a non-refillable diet coke. That was just for my other half. I had the lobster ceasar salad (damn this keto diet). Though that was tasty, the portion felt more like a side salad from one of those steakhouse chains. The salad was also $19. 

All in all - they're good. Good alcohol selection and the food is decent. I'd just ask the owners to toss in refills like the other places do and beef up the salad portion for those who can't have the carbs or glutens. :-)"
291,Lobster roll with jalapeños mayo was decent. There were big chunks of lobster on a toasted roll with a lot of butter. The crab roll was a bit disappointing. The crabs were watery and the red pepper mayo was not good. Lots of lobster and crab but tasted frozen/watery.
292,"After receiving numerous recommendations about HighRoller, the pushing factor that got me through these doors was my husband learning that they served Froze (his new favorite drink). 

HighRoller is nestled in towards the top of Exchange street. Given all the current/recent construction in the area, it is an easy place to go unnoticed. However, if you find your way here you won't be disappointed. 

The interior is just what you would expect of a cute little Maine lobster shop. It is consumed with red's and whites and has a very simple relaxed vibe. Right as you walk in the door, you are immediately greeted by a register where you place you order once ready. 

The menu has a decent variety of lobster options to choose from (tacos, traditional rolls, grilled cheese). I chose to order the lobster grilled cheese, an order of fries, and a Bloody Mary. 

The service was pretty quick and our food was delivered within 10-15 minutes. Everything was amazing! I found that the grilled cheese was filled with a good amount of lobster and that they used quality cheese which provided a nice richness that perfectly complemented the lobster. The fries had a wonderful Cajun seasoning and came extra crispy which is a personal favorite. Their dipping sauces were also very tasty with a favorite being the Jalapeño mayo. 

As you can expect, the prices were that of which you would expect for any lobster place and the meals with lobster were around $19 each. Definitely not a place I would dine at every week, but I will certainly be coming back whenever I need a good lobster fix."
293,"Their lobster roll is indeed excellent as advertised- super fresh, large chunks of claw and tail (none of those tiny shreds you often find), stuffed into a buttered and grilled roll, topped with a drizzle of the tasty sauce of your choice to give it just a kiss of flavor instead of drowning it in glop (I recommend the lime mayo). This roll definitely hits the spot- it won't totally blow your mind or shock you with its uniqueness, but it's precisely what a cold lobster roll should be IMO (especially accompanied with a pint of local beer) and I left very satisfied.

I also dug their potato salad- lots of flavor, and a good accompaniment to my roll. The fries are solid too, although I'd rather save that for elsewhere (like Duckfat). And the corndog was good as well, if you're not a lobster person.

I do dig the diner vibe and counter service, although wish they could find a way to separate the lines between the people trying to put their name in for a table and the people trying to order (you get seated first and then need to go back up to the counter to order), which can get crowded and confusing/not efficient. But that's my only real complaint- overall this place is a win."
294,"We have been in Portland for 5 days and we have eaten here 3 times. Definitely gonna go again before we leave. Maybe 2 more times. So happy they opened a brick and mortar but part of me missed the ""realness"" of the cart. Anyway, the food here is bangin and the people are mad chill. My favorite restaurant in America. Peace, love, buns."
295,"Giving the deserved highest of ratings. Such good food. Such good service. Simplicity at its best. If you're looking for fancy, craft cocktails or bougie atmosphere - not the spot. Even if you are, check yourself and go here, not to disappoint."
296,"This place is AWESOME!!   Not only the food, but also the customer service!!  The lobster meat was huge claw chunks in the roll. Got fried to go with it and they were fantastic. I could belly up at this joint every day!!!"
297,"Fun, fun, fun atmosphere. Tiny restaurant/bar. Phenomenally awesome lobster roll. The attendants were quite busy and bustling about to ensure everyone was seated/happy/eating drinking."
298,"This place was packed at 2/3pm on a Saturday. That should say something.

However, I didn't enjoy their rolls much mainly because I prefer classic lobster rolls over any experimental. You get to choose your sauces and buns, so it should be interesting for those who want to try something new!"
299,Great lobster roll and a rose! You can choose two sauces for your lobster. I just used melted butter so not to overpower the lobster. It was delicious and so much lobster. This place is busy-top of exchange st. We went a little later after lunch and sat at the counter. Fun crowd.
300,"Open kitchen and locally sourced, one of the most incredible restaurants in the region. Open only for dinner, strongly recommend putting in reservation a head of time. 

Ambience 5/5 -
Beautiful decor and lighting, centered around the open kitchen with a large oven. 

Food 5/5 -
The starter bread alone was already very good. We got the oven baked mussels, foie gras, and scallops. Each with distinct flavor, especially the mussels, which is a must try!

Service 5/5 - 
Just great, the waiters are knowledgeable about what they are serving.

This is a place where you expect great food and service, and they deliver it. Can't wait to go back and try other seasonal dishes. Strongly recommend!!!"
301,"To start with the you need reservations. They don't open until 5:30.  If you planning on walking in, go early get a reservation and then come back.   They fill up fast.     Be sure that our cell phone is charged, you will need it's light to read the menu.  It was very dark and the small candle on the table didn't make reading easy.  The overall decor is pleasant, just dark.   The kitchen is in the dining room.  It was enjoyable to watch food being made.  The appetizers and salads came out fast for people but entrees took a long time. The head chef and sous chefs looked the least busy of everyone.  For our family of 3 the wait for food seemed long. We didn't have anything except our entrees and sides.
  The best part of my meal was the bread and veggies.   Be warned that they don't have a kids menu, just smaller portions of two meals and a bowl of pasta.    So if you have a picky kid, don't bring them here.    I had a flank steak and brussel sprouts and my husband had a pork chop with mashed potatoes.  Be warned nothing comes with your entree, if you want sides you have to order them separately.    My steak was cooked perfectly but needed salt and pepper and other seasonings.   My husband said his was good, but nothing spectacular.
  The price point is very high for 3 of us, it was almost 200 with tip.    Considering the food wasn't out of this world I don't feel that it was worth it.  We don't mind paying for good food but this wasn't it.
  The menu changes nightly to weekly based on the chef's whim.    The best part was we found where they go their bread from and were able to visit the bakery the next day and get some.    
   I might go back, but with a city full of spectacular places to eat, I would most likely choose somewhere else."
302,"Our first time at Fore and we did a walk-in around 5:30 and were seated by 6.  One of our party had been there on business and strongly recommended it.  

From the extremely prompt and attentive bar service (we sat on a couch at the end of the bar) to our bread (made fresh at the bakery down stairs) to our apps  (Muscles & Lobster stew which were off the charts good) to our dinner (pork chop, roasted chicken, Monk fish and braised short rib) to a modest yet excellent wine list for all budgets, I highly recommend this restaurant. Our waiter (Lance) was one of the best I've experienced.  He was attentive to our every need and left us alone when we were chatting and laughing.  My brevity in reviewing should not in any way construe anything other than excellent food, service and atmosphere.  

Whoever trains the staff has done their job well.  Every interaction with a staff member was perfect."
303,"I haven't been to Fore Street for literally 20 years.  I think it's so funny that such a great restaurant has no sign on the outside and you just have to know where it is.

So we were in the area visiting - had no idea what time the restaurant was open or even if it was open on a Sunday night.  We got parking across the street at 4:45pm - went to the door and they said they'd be open at 5pm and would start taking names then.  There were already about 10 people ahead of us.

When we got in they sat us at the bar and said they would begin seating for dinner at 5:30pm.  At 5:30ish they sat us directly next to the kitchen where we were able to see the cooks prepare all the meals that evening.  In my opinion, we had the best seats in the house - it was like eating at the Chef's Table.  We really felt like we had a dinner and a show.

All of the food was fantastic and we felt that really everything was priced very reasonably for what we had.  It really made our night!"
304,"We stopped in here around 830 on a Saturday night in April and were able to get a couple of seats at the bar. I would recommend making reservations if you want a table. Prices are a little on the high side but for a menu that changes daily, it's totally appropriate. It's a restaurant like this that wins over the pickiest of eaters because every singe thing on my plate was delicious (yes, I even ate the mushrooms). Great place for a date night, anniversary, or if you just feel like being a baller!"
305,"Fore Street is pretty much the hottest ticket in town of you talk to locals and I could see why, this place pulls no punches whilst delivering culinary excellence.

Getting a reservation is borderline impossible so your best bet is to go as a duo and try for a walk in. They reserve a third of their tables for walk ins although the wait is really long. We waited about 2 hours for our table but it was worth it in the end as this was one of the meals I have had a while.

When you walk in, you're immediately drunk off the intoxicating aroma of the burning wood stoves they use to cook most of their meats. So many items are wood grilled and the end result is you feel like you're sitting by a cozy campfire eating perfect food. Beyond that the candle light votives really enhance the ambiance of the restaurant. 

Once we sat down they brought us the house bread which is made by the bakery downstairs. The sourdough misch is incredible and it is the perfect tool to sop up all the juices from your meal. From there we had the warm foie gras lobe which was the duck liver lobe cooked to perfection. It practically exploded on your knife when you cut into it melting as you spread it on your bread. Everything about it was perfect. 

Our main course was the pork chop and the roasted chicken.  The pork chop was juicy, smokey, and supremely flavorful. This is a must get. With a side of the mashed potatoes,  the combination was a bit of heaven on earth.The grilled chicken was well prepared but lacking a bit on flavor, it could've used a smattering of garlic and fresh herbs to liven it up.

We finished the meal with the apple crisp and the walnut pie. The crisp was overly spiced with what resembles a deep cider flavor. The pie was excellent and it mimicked a pecan pie. 

Overall Fore Street lived up to the billing and it's worth the visit if you can get in."
306,For a restaurant that's difficult to get reservations in it was surprisingly quiet. The open kitchen is a group concept and the space is beautiful with the brick and rustic decor. Their bread is made by the bakery downstairs and it really soft and crusty. Their drinks run sweeter than I'd prefer and the manhattan is almost overwhelmingly orange flavored. I enjoyed their mussels- cleaned well and no sand anywhere. It's a very traditional mussels but nothing you cant have at other restaurants. The pasta was okay but felt it was overly oily and I wished I had passed on it. The steak was well cooked to a perfect medium rare and had good flavor and was tender. I didn't care for their Brussels sprouts which I found too sweet and not savory or texturally we're kind of mushy. It's a beautiful spot and I enjoyed the restaurant and the service but was hoping to be more excited by the food.
307,"A Monday evening- snow, sleet, slush- and the place is packed, bustling, humming, and happy.
A scene from Ratatouille- the sun choke soup was a ten, the pork belly appetizer just superb, and this pork dish, incredible.
Our waitress Emily is already one of the family-
Have been coming here since It opened 20+ years ago, and it never fails. Makes me wonder why I ever go anywhere else!
Thank you Fore Street, thank you Sam.
Michael LaCombe"
308,"Fore Street is an incredible open-kitchen, oven roasting dining experience that everyone should have.

You can see eeeeeeverything that's going on...I could probably just have drinks and sit at the bar all night watching them cook. Pulling and pushing trays into the wood-burning oven, live-prep...it was mesmerizing. 

Food and service are top notch, so I'm glad this place was so-highly recommended. 

After my drink order was taken, I was started off with a plentiful basket of Standard Baking Co. (amazing bakery in Portland, which I believe own-affiliated with Fore Street, along with Scales and Street & Co.) sourdough bread, with ample creamy butter, salt, and pepper. 

I honestly don't quite recall what cocktails (2) I had, but they were delightful. 

For my first dish, I ordered the famed Wood Oven Roasted Maine Mussels in garlic almond butter and dry vermouth. Wow. Best mussels I've ever had...and with that delicious sourdough, there was no broth left when I was done with that (quasi-questionable decision, because this kept me to two dishes instead of a planned through...but it was soooo good!)

Second dish was the Wood Grilled Atlantic Squid with grilled napa, scallion, pea tendril, fermented red pepper aioli and carrots. OMG again. I don't know what it was, but this squid/calamari was just packed with so much flavor, it was unbelievable.

Hard I not filled up on the bread/broth, the pan seared chicken livers sounded friggin incredible (roasted celeriac and carrot, pea tendrils, maple mustard dressing).

Oh well, they shall be mine...next fine. Because there will most definitely have to be a next time."
309,"I can't believe that I haven't written a review of this restaurant before this!  We always make it a point to eat here when we visit Portland and we usually come up once a year (since 2015).  We been in the summer and the fall and have never been disappointed.   Although we always make reservations we go early to have a drink at the bar and immerse ourselves in the wonderful smells.  Fore Street has an open kitchen and part of the fun is watching the process.  

For our entree's, my husband usually orders the hanger steak and I usually get the pork loin.  For apps, he likes the soup d'jour (or the pork belly if available).  I'll have a salad (this last time had the beet salad).  Dessert this time was the steamed pudding for him and the carrot cake for me.

Service at the bar and the table is professional, prompt and friendly.  We have noticed that some of the servers and bar staff have been there for a while; to me that means that it I a good working environment and it shows in the service.

If you haven't visited Fore Street yet, please do.  It is an excellent experience!"
310,"4.5 rounded up. 

Such a great experience if you do it right. By that, I mean you should definitely plan ahead and make reservations. And when you do, make sure you specify the exact table if you're picky. We had a cozy table where we could see the kitchen. Other folks had specifically asked for tables near the window. We came to celebrate our anniversary and the staff left us a cute card. 

Highly recommend the mussels (soooo amazing I want it now). The cauliflower was good, not amazing. The other two fish dishes were delicious as well. The salmon had a great nutty base to it. The bread that comes with the meal is superb also. Wine was very good. 

We didn't love our waiter as he wasn't super great about timing. Our entrees took a really long time (like 40+ minutes) to come out. Since we could see the kitchen, we kept wondering why all these sea basses were being cooked but not brought out to us. We asked the waiter about it, and he seem too nonchalant about it. The dish promptly came out after though. 

Still, a really good experience. Must do if you're visiting Portland."
311,"4 stars for food/drinks/staff
+1 Star for the rustic and beautiful setting

I LOVE that their kitchen is out in the restaurant. Love love love!!!

We arrived on a Thursday night without reservations, but waited for seats at the bar. While we waited, a server came to take our drink order. We really appreciated how kind the staff was despite how busy they were. 

The food was great! I had fish and my husband had steak, and we shared the cauliflower. It was all delicious and worth the wait!"
312,"Portland, ME.  I've only heard of this town as a foodie Mecca by friends and relatives and now that my kid is at sleep away for two blissful weeks... it was time for us to food crawl through this quaint sea side town.... first stop Fore Street.

This old brick building sports what seems to be the original metal casement windows and once you enter, you can feel the warmth of a cozy, darkened dining room, ample bar and a bustling open kitchen.  We sat for a cocktail on the deep sofas in the bar area whilst they readied our table and the impression here is that whether you meet your many friends here, or you are gunning for a canoodling romantic dinner, you will be pleased!  I had a neat pour of Booker's with a side of ice and wifey chose from their cocktail offerings-- a Martini made with vodka, grapefruit, elder flower and a rosemary sprig.  Perhaps 14-16 bucks for this cocktail is not the greatest of values, but she enjoyed it nevertheless.

Benson was our waiter this evening and he navigated is through tonight's offerings which change daily and thoroughly as we learned.  The Menu is divided into courses of small plates that run the gamut from salads and soups to sea and land plates and then to an ample array of charcuterie.  We began with the heirloom carrot and pea salad and a charcuterie of pork terrine, chicken liver mousse, pickled lamb heart and tongue and the usual array of accompaniments.  When paired with their artisan bread this really could have been a meal on its own given the richness level.  Everything was stellar-- the greens were fresh and flavorful and the charcuterie scintillated with wonderfully gamey flavors and spices that matched up well with the jam and mustard as well as with the Tuscan red that Benson picked out for us.

Our mains were no less amazing-- wifey had the blue fish, fire roasted atop a tomato basil and duck fat potato mash and I had the ""medium"" hangar steak served with cippolini onions and mushrooms.  Benson convinced me that ""medium"" was the right call on this cut and thankfully, their version of medium was nice and pink.....We also enjoyed our sides of roasted cauliflower and squash.

For dessert we enjoyed a cheese course where we picked three of the 9 or so offerings and just like the charcuterie, they come arranges with the appropriate accompaniments such as almonds and and a house made jam to counter the gaminess.  The Triple creme Brie was the standout on this plate as it was a piquant blast of creamy heaven..... not something I usually get out of this type.

On the whole Fore Street was an amazing start to our foodie crawl as every course was expertly prepared and presented with fresh and semi local ingredients.  Great job guys and we look forward to our next ""Fore-ay"" here.... (sorry.... couldn't resist....)

313,"Not the most innovative in terms of dishes, but they definitely know how to work that wood burning oven..

Mussels were out of this world delicious. I literally drank the soup.

The hake was cooked perfectly - it was flaking away with the fork without much effort. 

The bone-in pork loin was juicy, charred and smokey, just as you would expect. Very simple but done right.

Waiter was very patient and helpful with the wine list and we left extremely full and satisfied. 

Worth the hype!"
314,"Quite possibly one of my five favorite restaurants in the country.  Definitely my fav in Portland.  Great food, beer list and service.  Reservations are a must no matter the day."
315,"Fantastic food. My friend and I visited Portland on a whim and decided to stop into Fore Street in hopes we could secure an early dinner without reservations. We walked in at 4:45p ahead of 5p opening on Friday and we 3rd in line for an ""unreserved"" seat, which they allot 1/3 of the restaurant. They let us in promptly at 5p and we decided to eat at the bar. There were probably 2 dozen people behind us at opening time - get there at least 15min early for last minute table!

We ordered the following:

Dry Rubbed Pork Loin - incredible bark from the dry rub, perfectly cooked and moist on the inside. May only suggest to the restaurant to have a little more flavor in the accompanying side. The fermented cabbage left me wanting a more flavorful side to complement the amazing meat. Potentially a grape red wine reduction sauce? Pickled onions?

Atlantic Bluefish Filet - perfect crispy skin outside and moist but not soggy inside. The accompanying beans with bacon was delicious and definitely completed a full bodied flavor.

Roasted Cauliflower - the wood roast add a tasty char and the almond romesco sauce put a unique taste to the classic dish. 

Overall - highly recommend but beware of the popularity and need to plan with either reservation or early dinner to beat the line!"
316,"Beautiful rustic dinner// glad I had my mom in town to pay for it... Fore Street isn't really an everyday restaurant- save it for a special occasion. They have a menu that changes based on the quality of available ingredients and they focus on wood oven roasting. Our pan-seared, oven roasted meat and fish (Hanger Steak, Whole Fish of the day) and vegetables were fabulous. Their dessert also blew me away."
317,"Fore Street is a beautiful restaurant in downtown Portland with an intimate ambiance and an open kitchen so you can see right into the kitchen as meat roasts on the rotisserie and the wood fired oven. Unfortunately, we were underwhelmed by the food here given both its reputation and the prices. We enjoyed the mussels with garlic (hard to mess that up) and the wood fired pork chop but much of the food was under seasoned. It didn't have enough flavor. The bluefish was too fishy, and I love the taste of fish so I was confused. I would expect more from a place with the caliber of Fore Street. Overall a good experience but not like the many 4+ Yelp star experiences I've had."
318,"After wanting to come to Fore Street for years, and having lived in Maine for three years, I finally made a reservation (over a month in advance, in fact!) and secured my Sunday night table. It's a huge space and has a friendly feel. The menu is expansive and constantly in flux, which is pretty wild when it comes to asking the waiter what's good...he doesn't know! everything on the menu is new, but looks exciting! 

We started off with three appetizers: mussels with almond butter, a chilled seafood platter, and a dozen oysters. The mussels were pretty good. I thought the broth could have used a stronger almond flavor though. The seafood platter was a great sampler of a bunch of different fishes. The oysters are spectacular. They're masterfully chucked, and the opposite of slimy. 

For my main course, I opted for the oven roasted lobster, which came with a side of a corn pudding. This was a killer lobster. Truly one of the best cooks on a lobster I've had....which makes sense since this is a top restaurant in Maine. It's soft and buttery, and the corn side was actually the best part of my meal. Super unique concept and a really fun texture. My dad ordered the lamb dish, and his lamb was VERY tough, so just be wary of that if you're considering that dish.

For dessert, I got the chocolate creme brulee. It was small but tasty. Not a bad way to cap off the meal.

Fore Street should probably get 5-stars if it was based on the food alone, but I see an issue with giving them that distinction after a really weird interaction I had at the restaurant. I, a 21-year-old, decided to order a cocktail which was advertised as blueberry and mezcal. I ordered the drink, and the waiter didn't ask to see my ID, but I assumed there wouldn't be any problems. I got my blueberry drink, and it was honestly pretty bad BUT it really didn't taste like alcohol at all. And I'm a lightweight and didn't even feel slightly tipsy. When the bill came we noticed that the drink was less expensive than advertised on the menu, and the waiter informed us that it was actually a MOCKTAIL, because he thought I was underage. Well, I could've shown you my ID if you were curious because I don't typically like drinking straight sodas. Bizarro."
319,"Food was very yummy. I enjoyed everything they served us. Place was busy but still comfortable environment. Very dark as another mentioned, could not see what was on my plate and had no idea what I was about to eat till it was in my mouth (not even kidding). Our service was lacking. She was rude and not helpful. She actually slammed plates on our table when I commented on one of our dishes. I found hostess unpleasant as well. I'm not sure why service can't be as good as the food as it impacts my visit more. Food and atmosphere 4 stars. Service 2 stars."
320,"I have to say, it could be what I ordered, but don't include rabbit on the menu if you don't know how to cook it. It was like chewing on plastic. So tough and impossible to chew or bite through. After all the high recommendations I had received I decided to try Fore Street, but it's not for me. I was rushed in and rushed out, not even offered dessert, had to ask for the menu. Drinks were great, the one shining star."
321,"Sept 2018 - We have been coming here since 2016, and the food and service is outstanding, I cannot say a bad word about this place.   Love the rustic decor, and we love sitting at the bar to eat.   When we arrived without our a reservation we asked to sit at the bar to eat and waited around an hour to be seated.  We really didn't mind since we sat in the lounge and had a drink.  Also, they will serve you Appetizers in the lounge area from their Menu if you were out of your mind with hunger but we waited.  We ordered the Appetizer Fettuccine that was rich with garlic and butter, and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  We shared the Hanger Steak (medium rare) that was also cooked to perfection, and the meat melted in your mouth with each bite, YUM!   This is a MUST Try restaurant when you are in the area.  
*Note: there is plenty of metered parking, and their menu is always changing."
322,"Fore Street exceeded expectations. We got the hanger steak, scallops, garlic mash and the pork belly. I ate a whole loaf of homemade bread to myself. 

The restaurant had great service and all food was cooked to perfection. Only recommendation is to make a reservation. If you decide to do a walk-in, it's a least a 2 hour wait, but definitely worth it."
323,Lovely setting for a romantic outing. I would leave the kids at home. Our server was so knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. The bread is yummy and looks to be made fresh in house.
324,"My best friend had her bachelorette trip in Portland and as her MOH, I Yelped the crap out of restaurants in the area to pick the best of the best. Fore Street was one of the first places I made a reservation at and it definitely did not disappoint. The mood in the restaurant was just right and I loved the open kitchen. 

Their menu changes every day -- I can't remember the exact names of everything we ordered, but I'll try my best. For appetizers, we got the SOFT SHELL CRAB which was pretty bomb. We also got this platter of chilled seafood -- it was unique but it wasn't that great. It was just five different samples of fish I believe. I got the SEA SCALLOPS and they were plated on top of different greens and I think some type of grain. Out of all the things I tried that night, the scallops were the best, in my opinion. One of the girls got a skirt steak I believe which was also delicious and quite juicy and tender. 

The price is pretty hefty and don't think it's worth it for some of the appetizers we had. I love it when restaurants change the menus every day. I'll definitely be back the next I'm in town. If you want a break from the typical lobster/seafood meal in Maine and want to try something different, definitely make a rez at Fore Street!"
325,"The mussels appetizer was absolutely amazing. What really brought this dish home was the garlic and almond butter sauce.

For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake with homemade peanut butter ice cream. It was so good we practically were licking the plate.

The service was outstanding. Servers and bartenders were attentive and friendly.

So why not 5 stars you ask? Our meals, although delicious, were barely luke warm when served-a bit disappointing."
326,"Great service, good food but a bit overpriced for a lot of salt and brown butter. It is one of the good ones but no longer the best..."
327,"Went with my husband and got seated near the brick oven which we loved, we also got to see dishes being assembled which we also appreciated. Our waiter was great, very attentive, friendly, honest and informative. All of the food we got was absolutely perfect and unlike other dishes we have had throughout our food travels. The restaurant itself is just very neat and had a good ambiance. Everything is fresh and I believe local with a menu which changes day to day. They make their own bread which is delicious and served with sea salt, creamy butter and black pepper. 
The salads were delicious, best beet salad I have ever had. We also got a squid dish and one with monkfish, the seasonings and char on it was so unique and delectable!! was compelled to get dessert although full. Dessert was oh so good. Recommend anything and everything and hope your experience is as good as ours was."
328,"We were so excited to check this place out. My brother has raved about this place so the expectations were high. This place barely met expectations. Why so?

PROs: lots of options on the menu; rotating menu is a nice touch; waitress was friendly, patient and helpful; ambiance was rustic and beautiful; ingredients appeared high quality; free bread; smells like campfire inside; amazing mashed potatoes.

CONs: Male hostess has a snoppy attitude; fairly average entrees - nothing that stands out from other high end food establishments; probably too pricey for what they're providing ($8 for broccoli - is it dipped in diamonds?); bread is outsourced. 

If you want a decent meal that is worth the cost, drive down to Gracie's in Providence RI. You get amuse-bouche complementary and in-house made glazed beer bread. Now that's a classy dinner."
329,"Our first family meal in Portland, and the menu was so delightful, so many fresh and local options. We had a wonderful time sitting in the booth, DINING."
330,"Having not been to Fore Street in a number of years, my wife and I went there last night to celebrate her birthday.  I had forgotten how loud the restaurant could be, but that is part of the experience. The food was good, not mind blowing as I remembered it, but it was good. I felt like having littlenecks as an appetizer, and I have to tell you, they were the tiniest littlenecks I ever saw. whoever shucked them does need some training, as each one had bits of shell in them. 
The main courses were really very good. My wife had the oven roasted pork loin which she loved and I had the oven roasted Mackerel which was a suggestion by our waitress, and it was beautiful. Plenty of food, attentive wait staff, good wine, delicious desserts.
All in all a good night out to celebrate a birthday !"
331,"OMG... 
This NEEDS to be on your list of places to eat in Maine.
If you LIVE in Maine and haven't been, you are definitely MISSING OUT!

Bread & Butter.
Shiitake & Heirloom Tomato Salad.
Wood Grilled Longfin Squid.
Pan Seared Chicken Livers.
Fore Street's Dry Rubbed Pork Loin. (***The BEST!!)
Garlic Mashed Potatoes.
Hand Made Chocolates.

We Loved EVERYTHING!!
Truly unforgettable..."
332,"OMG.  Three letters are all that is necessary to describe an experience at Fore Street.  It's not every day that you come across an experience that transcends or alters your opinion of what something should be or has been for all your life.  Today, at Fore Street, that moment in time where you are given a choice, take the blue pill, which will ultimately lead to a blissful and safe but ignorant experience or take that red pill, the one that will free your mind, change your perception of reality, change untruths you've held dear from day one.

Morpheus (masquerading as my server this evening as David B.) steered me, Neo, towards that red pill and changed my perception of how good a pork chop can be forever.  Never before have I had a pork chop that wasn't over salted, fried, simmering in butter, or wrapped around some other fatty pork(pork belly) to add flavor or juiciness.  This pork chop needed none of that to be better than any other pork chop I've had.  This pork chop was tender and juicy, full of flavor, but not salty.  It was wrapped around this slightly sweet almost ketchup-y tomato gastrique, surrounded by absolutely perfect black trumpets, sweet peppers, corn and alliums which were plate cleaning licking awesome.  David's mild insistence that while that Hanger steak was going to be a great option as well, that this Pork Chop, cooked by that guy (he pointed to him) behind working the grill, was going to be the best Pork Chop ever.  Now I know how Neo felt when Morpheus gave Neo the freedom to choose and nothing will ever be the same.

If you ever get David,.... uhhh, Morpheus as your server, just listen to his suggestions.  Aside from this Pork Chop, he was spot on in regards to the Wood Grilled Longfin Squid and Wood Oven Roasted Mussels.  Before that Pork Chop entered my life, the Squid was going to be what I would have gushed about.  As it stands, this super tender squid will have to take a back seat.  Of the remaining items I tried this evening, the Foie Gras and Wild Mushroom & Grilled Corn Salad were amazing as well.

For dessert, the Nectarine Tarte and done.  Really.  Sweet and fresh sliced nectarines layered on top of a buttery crust and ultimately topped with ice cream.  All the desserts are insanely sized for like two or three.  

The entire experience was eye opening from the moment I sat down.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen area, right next to the wood burning oven, was the best seat in the house.  I was so close I felt like I was cooking tonight with all the heat that was generated by that oven.  Of all the dinners I've had in Portland, and there have been many, this has to be the dinner that tops all others.

Sadly with this knowledge that Pork Chop doesn't have to be dry and brined for hours, there is sadly one big issue, and that is I won't be able to replicate this Pork Chop myself or get to Fore Street often enough to enjoy.  Hey Fore Street, how about sharing the recipe and freeing the rest of the world from the notion that Pork doesn't have to be dry or water logged!"
333,"Best meal I've had in a long time! Definitely call and make reservations days in advance, unless you're okay with waiting 2 hours for a table. Not a place I would come to regularly as it is very expensive and hard to get into, more of a treat I would say for most locals. Very popular among tourists. But it was delicious!

We made reservations the night before and were sat immediately upon arriving. Great seats by the window overlooking the water on commercial street. Great cocktail list ($14-15). Bread on the table comes from Standard Baking Co. and is very good!

We ordered two appetizers, the pork belly which is a portion about the size of a deck of cards for $15 and was pretty good. The sweetbreads app (also $15) wasn't my cup of tea. My friend really liked it, however. 

I ordered the flank steak as my entree, cooked perfectly and it was delicious. My friend ordered the duck cooked two ways which comes with breast and a duck leg. I ate some of the duck breast and it was delicious! The entrees don't really come with sides, you have to order them separately. We ordered garlic mashed potatoes and fingerling potatoes. Both were delicious and I would order them again ($8 each and they are shareable portions). The entrees cost about $35 and up. 

We also ordered lagavulin, and a couple of dessert liquers to wrap things up. All in all we had two appetizers, two entrees, two side dishes, 6 drinks, and the bill came up to $230 including the tip."
334,"We visited the restaurant on 10.24.2018 while we were visiting Portland for a few days and it was definitely one of the better meals we enjoyed. 

First off, the building is sort of rustic, but very warm and inviting. The kitchen is open and located in the middle of the main dining floor. We were welcomed by the hostess and invited to sit in the bar while we waited for a table. 

The waitress in the bar area was friendly and we received our drinks fairly quickly. After a short wait, we were seated up the stairs and waited on by Ben. He was knowledgeable about the menu, made some good recommendations, and took great care of us. We really enjoyed the Hanger Steak and the Scallops were perfectly cooked."
335,"It's just ok.  The open kitchen is really open -- seeing that was a treat. But a bit over-priced and over-hyped. The bread from the amazing bakery in the same building is a highlight. But our pork and scallop dishes were over-salted and lacking other seasoning or depth of flavor. We thought this would be our truly memorable meal during our Portland trip, but it wasn't.  (That came the next night.)"
336,"I was very upset with my last trip to this restaurant. 
I had been here previously over the past 15 years numerous times and the food was excellent beyond excellent. The service is always excellent the restaurant it's self is unique one-of-a-kind and a wonderful atmosphere. 
I don't know what happened to the food we had the chicken dish and it was so difficult to cut we sent it back we were just unhappy with our main meal I'm so sorry Fore street  I don't know what has happened.
$$$$"
337,"My oh my. 
Parking is weird and reservations are a necessity because it's busy as hell, but there's not much more to list in the category of annoyances about this place.
We waited just a little for our table, but there was comfortable seating in the foyer where we could peruse the daily menus and plan our attack.

We wanted everything, but settled on the mussels (heavenly sauce, no grit, and yes, I confess we saw it on television), lamb sausage with cornmeal cake which arrived looking something like a street taco but not tasting like anything you could grab on the corner, roasted chicken that was tender and crispy, although maybe a little too salty, the hanger steak which had that lovely flavor you only get from cooking over an open fire and that melting tenderness which meant that cow must have exercised less than me, and a shared side of creamy butter with a little bit of potato mashed in to keep it on your fork.

Patrick, our waiter, was busy but gave us good service, and other than the salty chicken the only complaint I had was a little indigestion after, for which I blame our menu choices. 
If I am so fortunate that there is a next time, we might have to throw a salad or something into the mix."
338,"After a few visits into town - and forgetting to make a reservation in advance - we decided that we'd hit up Fore Street via the walk-in line and grab a meal before heading back to the airport. We arrived around 4:20 PM, and we were the only folks there for about 10-15 minutes on Sunday...for future reference, coming for a walk-in spot at 4:45 PM would be more than okay IMO. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the kitchen does not actually open until 5:30 PM - so if you are under the gun for time (like we were), you'll probably do what we did and end up eating dinner at the bar. It's plenty nice enough - a view of a classy, well-stocked bar full of liquor never gets old - but it doesn't quite compare to how the dining room looks, with its high ceilings and wooden slats marrying the industrial feel of the brick building the restaurant is housed in with a more rustic sensibility. That said, we were serviced pretty quickly at the bar and had plenty of time to spare when it came to making our flight - so no complaints there. The drink selection is what you'd expect - a handful of local ales - and the cocktail I had was pretty good as well.

The food here is excellent overall, and it's easy to see why after all these years, it is still the standard-bearer for the Portland food scene. For starters, though - the sourdough served here (unsurprisingly from Standard Baking, which is in the lower half of this building) is excellent. We started out with a few appetizers, with the oysters being the first served - a nice selection of local oysters that showcased some of the subtle differences in salinity and finishes. The mussels were excellent, and I really enjoyed the garlic almond butter giving the broth something a bit creamier and nuttier relative to a standard white wine sauce. Our last appetizer was the seasonal salad, which was light but not necessarily distinguishable in any way...definitely the least memorable dish. Then it was on the entrees, both of which were delicious. The half chicken I ordered was ridiculously good, with the honey brine giving the skin a vaguely sweet flavor that mixed so well with the natural juices from the meat. It's a ton of food, so be forewarned...but this was definitely a can't-miss dish from my view. My wife went with the poached lobster with corn, and while the corn preparation was a bit on the sweet side, the lobster was prepared to perfection. We then finished up with a very seasonal dish that was a lot of fun to eat - a mixture of large and small blackberries (I forget the proper terminology here), served with lemon curd and brown sugar for dipping. It's simple, not overly sweet, and a perfect way to end a meal at this restaurant in particular.

Although we didn't get a chance to make it here in the past, I am glad that we came, and whenever our next trip is, I will need to remember to book a reservation in advance so we can sit in the dining room! With a rotating menu - but with some favorites (like the half chicken and mussels) always on the menu, there is going to be something new - or an old favorite - to enjoy. Still worth a visit, even if it's one of the 'older' spots in town these days."
339,"Wonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful atmosphere! Went here with my husband for dinner and was extremely satisfied with the half chicken I ordered.
My husband ordered fish and the pork belly which were also great. Good beer menu!"
340,"I had a phenomenal birthday dinner here during my visit to Portland. We did not have a reservation (whoops), but we stopped by around 5:30 to put our name on the list and were told there would be about an hour and a half wait. We were okay with this (I expected it), and wandered across the street to grab oysters as an appetizer.

We checked back in with the hostess when we came back an hour later and she led us straight to our table! The ambiance was amazing - warm and homey, with the fire from the oven flickering off the exposed brick walls. The open kitchen was cool as well; all of the chefs worked like a well-oiled machine, which was nice to watch.

Anyway, with input from our server, we both ordered fish (Monkfish and another option I can't quite remember...) and also got a side of the mashed potatoes. Everything came out steaming in small cast-iron pans, which gave a nice crisp to the food. Every single bite was delicious and bursting with flavor, and I don't think I can do the food more justice than leaving it at that."
341,"Having such high expectations, Fore Street turned out to be a major disappointment!!! Food was mediocre at best.....the only saving grace was the Mussels appetizer (it was some of the best i have ever had, tender, succulent and the broth/sauce was delicious) . Other than that, the skin on the Fire Roasted Pork Belly was chewy. Lamb Chop was tough and tasteless, Roasted Halibut lack seasoning and so was the Roasted Sea Bass. Roasted Cauliflower and Mashed Potato were bad too.  I honestly can make these dishes way better at home.

We were also made to wait until our reserved time 8:15pm (arrived about 20 minutes early) despite two open tables and guess what......we were seated in one eventually.

NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
342,"This was my best meal. The only reason they lost a star is the fact that their waitlist process was a mess. I was told come back in 30-45 and it didn't seem like they were any closer to having a place at the bar for me. Additionally, I watched them give everyone else near me a menu to look at while they waited, but completely ignored and overlooked me. However, after I was seated the service was excellent. I order oysters, tomato tart and the lobster.  I loved the oysters. They even had some pretty meaty ones. The tomato tart was featured on unique eats. It was  yummy. Almost like a Margherita Pizza flavor.  Lastly, the lobster dish was a whole lobster and a nice butter sauce on it. The sides complimented the richness of the lobster. It was the perfect dish. I would get it again in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, they change their menu often, so who knows if it would be available again. I definitely recommend you going to this restaurant, but try to make a reservation to avoid any delays or confusion."
343,"Traveling 5 hours from New Jersey to visit Portland I asked around for the best places to eat and 4 couples said 'Fore Street is absolutely the spot'. One couple said they have come here 9 years from New york and have gone there every year without fail. 
    My girlfriend and I walked by and were immediately drawn by the smell of the wood oven. The open kitchen and wood oven made for a very welcoming atmosphere and our server, Nikko, was not only knowledgeable but, an absolute pleasure to speak to. 
     Everything on the menu is fresh and farm to table. All our dishes were perfectly cooked while the desserts were all homemade and stellar. 
Highly recommend this place and if you get Nikko as a waiter, you're in for a great time"
344,"We had a good experience at Fore tonight. We had two salads, the hangar steak, and the cauliflower side. The salads were incredibly fresh and unique and the cauliflower was delightful! Also the fresh bread to start is lovely.
Staff was knowledgeable and great. Only snafu for us is that with our 8 month old baby, as there are no highchairs or accommodations for kids, it was slightly difficult to eat peacefully. But, maybe that is on purpose?
Not sure! Either way, everyone was very kind and awesome regardless. 

Thanks!!"
345,"So what to add to all the glowing reviews of Fore Street - leave it at the place is just about perfect - maybe not for everyone but it has everything I love in a dining establishment.  It is pretty basic from the outside - I walked by during the day and didn't notice it but once you walk in and the smell of the open wood burned envelops you - well I knew I was in a happy place.  We arrived early - like way early because it was raining and took a seat at the bar - Fore Street not only has great food the bar is excellent as well - can't get Allagash back home so kept it simple and my wife went one of the specialty cocktails with beet juice and was very happy - especially after the second.  Was called well before our reservation time (thanks) and a quick note - you should make a reservation as far in advance as possible)  Fore Street is intimate with exposed brick and wood with dim but not dark lighting.  The restaurant not only has an open kitchen, the prep area is in the wide open with a massive basket of fresh bread on view as you walk to the table with staff preps out salads, etc. - our table didn't look into the kitchen and it doesn't appear they have a chef table but would like to just watch them work.  So about the food - started with oysters - we live in the mid-west and super fresh isn't an option so local oysters are a treat and these were so fresh and delicious the mignonette was not necessary and in most places the oysters would have been the pre-entree highlight but then there was the sauteed squid with mushrooms - it appears that it is not always on the menu but if it is do not hesitate - just cooked through tender squid matched with sliced mushrooms was amazing.  Also ordered a fettuccine app - kind of weird as an appetizer but house made pasta in a light white wine sauce was kind of fantastic - just didn't see it coming.  So after three pre-dinner snacks listen to our waitress and order the Halibut steak served with potatoes in a ripping hot (their term) tiny cast iron skillet - it was a porcelain white inch thick piece of fish just cooked through that accentuated the fish spectacularly.  My wife also took the recommendation of the Scallops cooked with navy beans and sweet black rice with slices of white radish - I would have never considered that combination but now can't imagine them any other way.  So three apps, two entrees - no way dessert was happening - until the warm cherry rhubarb cobbler - with cinnamon basil ice cream - are you out of your mind - forget everything else that happened - Fore Street would get 5 stars just on the dessert.  We actually discussed trying to get back in the next night - I would not go to Portland with eating at Fore Street and neither should you.  Bonus for eating at Fore Street - your sweater will smell like roasty wood for several days - I actually picked mine up from the suitcase when I got home and relived the experience."
346,"Came here in the early summer for a special dinner while visiting Portland. We got lucky and were able to get a late reservation (9PM) on the same day.

(Un) Fortunately, our table was not ready when we got there, so we decided to go to the bar to have a drink and some apps. We decided to go with the Porkbelly and Grilled Octopus and some Oban to go along with it... wow, what an amazing meal. Table was ready about 30 mins later (we decided to take our time) and we ordered the Scallops and Lamb. Scallops had an amazing texture and tasted fantastic. Lamb was grilled to perfection.

Would 100% recommend / return to this place."
347,"You want a treat for yourself? That's the place, try getting in around 5, sit at the bar and you might just get a table, food is awesome and the servers will help you find a great meal!"
348,"If you are in the area, Fore Street should be on your list of restaurants to visit! We split the sockeye salmon with lentils and it was delicious. Finished the night with rhubarb crisp and raspberry cheesecake, which were delicious. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is full of energy! Loved this place"
349,"I pretty much went to all the top restaurants in Portland already, except Fore Street, but we didn't have a reservations, since we stopped here on a whim.

Luckily, the hostess got us at the bar when there was a last-minute cancellation. SCORE!

I know the menu changes on a daily basis, but they have standard items and I just thought it was weird when the waiter said he doesn't have any idea of how anything tasted. 

How does he not know how the standard plates tastes. and I know restaurants that offers a tasting to their waitstaff before serving time, so they are able to speak to the dishes.

It wasn't like that here. but our waiter Benson said everything was good here.

I am always reluctant to order mussels because a lot of places doesn't cook them properly. I asked him and he advised that they were good.

When the mussels arrived, they were huge and I have never seen them of that size.

I tasted them and I was just like grossed out by the texture and this is coming from an Asian. I can eat Uni, roe, sea cucumber and etc, but I just couldn't stomach this fluffy, super soft, and mushy type of mussels.

I called the waiter over and advised that the mussels tasted overcooked, but he advised the mussels supposed to take like this because of the type of mussels that are from Maine. He said it was because I am used to PEI mussels, but I am thinking I had moules from France, and mussels in Asia and Australia and I doubt they are all PEI mussels, since it wouldn't make sense for them to get them from Canada. But none of those oysters tasted like these mussels here.

The two tables next to us ordered mussels as well and I was dying to hear their thoughts, and the table to my left, had Benson as our waiter and when they ordered the mussels, he didn't mention anything to them in terms of size or anything after I complained about the texture.

The table to my right had a different waiter and he didn't mention anything either, but I wasn't there to witness the table to the left. however, I got to see the people's reaction on my right.

I saw the guy taking a bite of the mussels and he put his fork down and didn't say a word. He didn't reach for more, but his dinner partner took more mussels and ate them without a pause.

She raved about them, but he just nodded and as I observed, each time he took a mussel, he would chase it with his beer.

When their waiter came by, he asked how everything was going, and the guy said, these mussels are ""fluffy"" and big. 

Their waiter didn't mention anything about being the characteristic of this certain type of mussels, but he said the reason why they are bigger is because it is their spawning season.

I would definitely had appreciate if our waiter gave us this insight before ordering mussels and not lie and tell me it is because it's due to the Maine's mussels.

Everything else besides the mussels incident and our waiter were great!"
350,Awesome place. Loved the atmosphere. Excellent service. And every single dish we tried tasted amazing. Highly recommend.
351,Romantic evening with my wife with great food and drinks! The open kitchen and the great staff made our evening the best ever. The food was amazing and is worth going back again and again.
352,"The perfect place for a fine dining experience in Portland! It is rustic, quaint, yet elegant. It's the perfect setting for a date night. Make your reservation early, or come in at 5pm when they open and ask for a later reservation that evening. We took a 9:30 reservation. Everything on the menu is chosen fresh THAT DAY, making everything SUPER fresh (and locally sourced). We got the mussels & they were perfectly seasoned, not too garlicky like most places make them. My other half got a salad, which was fresh and delicious! I got the roasted chicken. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. He got the pork...which was prepared like I have never had it before: with a delicious spice rub, and juicy. It was a huge cut (on the bone). The waitstaff is very pleasant and attentive. They made great recommendations. I would definitely try this place while you're in Portland! Note: I took no pics because I was enjoying every minute & every bite!"
353,"Before I moved to Portland, I used to come here a lot for work.  I would stay at the Hilton Garden Inn - which overlooks the Fore Street restaurant - and think about how it might be the most inviting restaurant in the entire world.  On a cold night in January, it looked so nice in that dining room with the wood fire heating and lighting up the restaurant.

After several years of drooling over the restaurant, I finally have gone to Fore Street (twice) since moving here.  I thought it would be a letdown, but it was totally the opposite.  The smoked seafood appetizer plate is honestly one of the best things I've eaten in Portland.  The main seafood entrees change daily and they are all great.   This is definitely one of those places where you want to save room for dessert. 

Yes, it is pricey, but unlike a lot of places in Portland, the portions are large.  An entree here alone is enough to fill you up.  Not small plates, high prices.  Worth it for a special occasion."
354,"I don't even know where to begin... EVERYTHING about dinner tonight was UNREAL. 100% best dinner I've ever had in Portland. Service was amazing, atmosphere was awesome, and the food was astounding. 

We were lucky enough to get a reservation day of (3 hours in advance, none the less) which is almost unheard of. Our table had a great view of the open kitchen, which includes a wood-fire oven and a spit. Our waiter was attentive without being too present; came by to check how we were doing and remove plates without being pushy. 

Our drinks were average (draft beer and glass of Pinot Grigio) but the food... oh my. I got the Atlantic char, my boyfriend got the flank steak, and we split a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Holy moly. I don't think we talked for the first 5 minutes we had our food; we were both in heaven! 

Dessert was decadent, delicious, and delightful. I got the chocolate fudge torte and my boyfriend got the vanilla layer cake. The layer cake was the perfect serving size for one person; I was only able to fit half the torte before feeling like I would need to unbutton my pants on the walk home - so I recommended splitting dessert. 

I can not wait to go back. And even though reservations can be tough to get, always try! You may get lucky like us"
355,"Honestly, I hate doing this. I'm not into Yelp unless it's to hype up a restaurant after an amazing meal. I've only ever left one bad yelp review before: it was for a dentist's office that tried to scam me into getting work I didn't need (they've since been shut down). Anyway, I don't believe in doing this but feel it needs to be done. The 2 stars are for service, otherwise it'd be a 1. The food was beyond disappointing: bland, overcooked at points and undercooked at others, and seriously, way, way, way overpriced (and this is coming from a New Yorker). I truly hope this place can figure it out, but in the meantime, spare yourself the heartache."
356,"Come here for our anniversary every year! It is always phenomenal. Food, service, wine list, all top notch! Need to make reservations....way in advance!!"
357,"Love this place, especially the amazing open kitchen and their big vegetable pantry. I highly recommend the wood oven roasted Maine mussels."
358,"If you're in Portland, do not miss this restaurant. Phenomenal. We tried to get in on Memorial Day for dinner but it was a 2 hour wait so we came back the next day when it opened at 5pm. We sat at the bar and had amazing service. The entire place is upscale and you must make RSVP's 2 months in advance. We had a variety of cocktails and food and everything was beyond great. The menu changes daily. The Maine mussels, mushroom pasta and fresh oysters were outstanding. The bread and desserts are from the Standard Baking Company downstairs. The bread and fresh butter make my mouth water just talking about it. Its not cheap but its worth it! 5+ stars from us.

Go here, you won't regret it."
359,Love this place .. they know what they are doing ... pork chops to salads to veggies and sardines.. everything is impeccable and well executed.. wait staff is friendly.. wine selection is great... please make reservations in advance
360,"We ate at Fore Street this evening and the ambience and food were absolutely fantastic but the service from our waiter was sub par at best, it seemed like the other waiters were very attentive though (so this stops me from giving the restaurant 5 stars; if I could I would give the restaurant 4.75 stars though because the food more than made up for it but sadly yelp doesn't allow me to do this). 

The wine and drink menus were extensive with great selections, we ultimately went with the Pinot Noir and it was delicious.

Next we got the muscles, which were absolutely fantastic...if I could have I would have drank the sauce!!!!

Finally, for dinner, we got the Arctic Char, steak and Quail...they were all great but I absolutely loved the Quail and steak and again if I could, I would drink the sauce. I even took the remnants home to go because I may make a stock from the Quail."
361,"We've been eating at Fore Street for a very long time.  I hate how hard it is to get in because I'm not a planner.  That said, I made a reservation for four and needed to change it to five and they were totally cool and gracious.  The restaurant scene in Portland can be a little precious these days and not in a good way; so it is nice to have one of the early pioneers of the food culture be low key, client focused and accommodating. And oh, yeah, the food is always fantastic. Looking forward to our family meal."
362,"I can't believe I've never written a review on Fore Street. I don't even think it's necessary for me to go into deep detail here - because I've never had a bad meal. I've had the chicken, pork, char, sea bass, plaice, flank steak, various salads, sides, oysters, mussels, you name it. It's all delicious. The service is wonderful, the ambiance is to die for- it's like a scene from Ratatouille.  It smells good, and the bar is nice as well.

Plus, the walk-in option is always a nice perk; they take a certain amount of reservations, and there is a certain number of tables for walk ins. This is kind of perfect for my relationship. Why you may ask? Once long ago, the man I fell in love with would send me lists of  restaurant options, and we would research, overanalyze, and highly plan our dates. Then, as time went on, we started this whole ""winging"" phenomenon. On his first visit to my home state, we went to Fore Street on an uber-planned date, and now we just show up. And sorry to be mushy, but it's nice to have a place that has been consistently good, and that you can go back to and remember all of those early-on memories. Fore Street is one of those places that I will always love, both for its food, but for all of the times my heart has been so happy."
363,"This place is an experience in itself. Make a reservation in advance, and don't try to squeeze in a quick meal before an event. It is dimly lit but it fits so perfectly with the overall feel. You walk in and see everyone at work in a beautiful kitchen that fits so perfectly with the dining areas. The food is out of this world. You should take time to enjoy every bite because you can taste and see the amount of love and time they put into the meal and menu.  Highly recommend this place"
364,"We came to fore street and sat in the bar/lounge area. We ordered three appetizers and each one was amazing. Our waitress accidentally rung in a fourth and gave it to us on the House. The mussels were the best mussels I've ever had, the mushrooms with polenta were amazing, and the pork belly had so many different flavors. The martinis were delicious as well!"
365,"Had a reservation here and showed up 20 minutes early...sorry about that. Went to the bar to get a drink and was told no you can't sit here. 

You may be the the most popular restaurant in town but you have the worst service. Crap service very bad cocktails glad we ended up at eventide"
366,"Another delicious meal at Fore Street! I keep thinking I should go to another of the many good restaurants in Portland for our special occasions but it is so delicious with real earthy, complex and simple flavors. Thank you to all the staff for your hard work,  delish!"
367,Not worth the money or the hype - food is very good but nothing to write home about - service is fantastic however.
368,"Incredible meal from start to finish. My husband and I shared the tomato tart to start, and then I got the pork chop, while he got the flank steak. Both were delicious, and decent portions for an upscale place. The bread was also incredible since it comes from the standard baking company that is owned by the same people. Well worth the cost and very memorable meal."
369,"I had heard a great deal of good things about this restaurant before going there last Friday. Although I understand that every restaurant can have an off night, my impression was that Fore Street is grossly overrated, and when they mess up, they do very little to atone for it. 

My girlfriend and I were there for a birthday celebration. Both our entrees were a disaster. She ordered halibut, which came out virtually raw. I ordered lamb, which was tough as shoe leather and extremely difficult to cut. I noticed that the woman seated next to me also ordered lamb and was having trouble cutting it. I also noticed that her presentation was entirely different than mine, even though we ordered the same dish. When I inquired to our waiter about that, he said that the kitchen places the entrées into whatever dish is available, so people get different presentations. Seriously? A $40 entrée and that's what you do?


By the time we finally finished our entrees, after I switched to chicken and my girlfriend's halibut was sent back and returned still not really cooked through, we were too disgusted to order dessert. 

Most telling was that our waiter and the hostess both apologized profusely, but only our $12 app was comped. No offer even of a glass of wine. Still stuck with a $150 bill for a highly disappointing meal and experience."
370,"Have you read ""1001 Arabian Nights"" and drooled over the delicious dinner tables? The food at Fore Street transported us to such fairytales. Thanks to our lovely waitress Emily, we started with some greens and mussels. The mussels were out of this world, I don't know what they did to them, but at one point, I stopped and stared at my beautiful girlfriend's face and felt overcome by the very joy of being alive. Then we continued with black sea bass and scallops on crack. As a final touch, the most subtle and beautiful lemon meringue. We are actually considering extending our trip in Portland another day to taste the fire roasted chicken and lamb tomorrow evening."
371,"Incredible meal that does not dissapoint.  The chilled and smoked seafood platter and charcuterie plate were amazing items for two to split, giving a variety of smoky, salty and sweet flavors that were interesting and delicious.  The bread they use from the standard is craveable and the bite sized desserts are the perfect way to end a meal without finding yourself overstuffed."
372,"I really did not care for this place but am giving it 2 stars because my companion enjoyed his wood fired pork belly (which I actually thought was dry it had a nice sauce). I ordered the mussels which were undercooked; the broth they are served w has chunks of nuts in it instead of it being an infused broth which I didnt care for. The worst part was that there were tiny particles of shell in every single bite I took. That's not counting the large bits I could pick out (1 which was embedded in the mussel). I had to have the waitress fire it up again which she did to both warm them and cook them more. I also told her about the shell issue to which she apologized and walked off. I left plenty of mussels on the plate- take it off the bill if there are so many issues right? We said nothing, paid, and left. The people sharing our table seemed to enjoy their seafood appetizer though."
373,"Great spot loved the fettuccine, pork & salad. They should stop what they are doing with the halibut it's as if it's poached and has no flavor."
374,"I REALLY wanted to give Fore Street five-stars. All of the reviews here are so amazing that I thought for sure I would have an equally exceptional experience, but I think this is a solid 3-3.5 star restaurant.
The food is very good, but it is not GREAT. We split two appetizers- a pork belly appetizer and the mussels. While the mussels were delicious (especially with a crusty piece of bread to sop up the sauce they are in), the pork belly really lacked in flavor, and was very tough to chew. Entrees were the half chicken and a duo of duck. Both were very flavorful, and no complaints on the execution of the cooking, but I just do not believe that the taste comes close to justifying the price of this meal.

Based on the a\\experience above, I would typically award this restaurant 4 stars, not 3. However, the entire time we were there we felt extremely put-off by our waitress. I don't know how to explain the vibe that she was sending, but it almost seemed like she thought we were going to try to run out on our bill? I'm not sure if we looked ""too young"" to be able to afford such an ""expensive"" meal (we are both almost 30), but I didn't appreciate being made to feel like we were somehow beneath the quality of such a prestigious establishment.
And not that it matters, but we were both dressed more than appropriately for the location (skirt/blouse for me, blazer/slacks/button-down) for my fiance. 

My advice to management would be to retrain the staff to respect the patrons more, and avoid the snooty, entitled attitudes."
375,We enjoyed a tasty meal at Fore Street. The reviews do it justice! Our server was incredible and helped my picky and overwhelmed with all the menu choices decide on a meal. The atmosphere is nice - likes the kitchen in the middle of the room. The handmade dessert was wonderful. Only issue we had was the fact we were seated so late. Definitely make reservations if you are headed to Portland!
376,"Great restaurant, great menu and great vibe. The only reason I didn't give 5 is I felt service could have lived up to a higher standard. The hostesses were fantastic and our server was nice but I felt we waited more than we should have. The menu is so fantastic good luck deciding on what to order. I haven't seen a menu so great in....well....can't remember! 
Started with a cheese platter, next was a split entree of the heritage smoked pork w sweet potato puree and ended with apple/cranberry cobbler and cappuccino. And it was not overpriced. 
Next time I will get the seafood sampler! 
I hope to come back!"
377,"Wow, this is almost as good as it gets...

I was lucky enough to get a reservation here with only two weeks notice, barring it wasn't the ideal time my family wanted, but we are very glad we got to eat here.

I could write the longest review ever for this place, but i'll keep it as short as I can.  Hostest and waitress were super friendly and accommodating (since they don't do highchairs or anything, and my 13 month old niece cant just sit in a booth, ha.  We brought something with us, and it worked out great, and even the random times she was loud (hey, she's still a baby), no one complained or looked at us weird.  

We ordered a lot, almost too much between the six of us, but every single dish impressed.  I mean, every, single, dish...  There was nothing we ordered that we went ""that was just okay"", every dish was delicious, and fresh.  This really stays true to it's farm-to-table credo, and you can see it in the menu as it changes often as well.  The place itself is beautiful too, and they had a good beer and bourbon selection, I got my EH Taylor Barrel Proof!  

The big thing was the pacing of the food was great too, there were never more then 2-3 dishes on the table at a time.  Dinner was about 2-2.5 hours, and it didn't feel rushed or slow, was perfect.  This place fits in my Top 5 places that i've ever ate at.  

Worth it, easily."
378,"Fore Street was a beautiful intimate experience for such a large restaurant. 

The open kitchen in the middle with decadent food fumes entangling with the wood fire smoke wafting towards your nostrils was a feast in itself. 

I've never had mussels as good as the ones from Fore Street and the chicken is magical. 

I dream of the mussels and chicken often, and tell myself that 5 hours isn't too far of a drive to eat here. Our waitress was exceptionally friendly as well. 

We arrived at 9PM on a Saturday night and it was still pretty busy. I would suggest reservations."
379,"Not the friendliest place! We were going to go here for dinner and drinks before heading back to Boston. We did not have a reservation, but we assumed we could put our names in, if their was a wait, and just sit at the bar until our table was ready. It was a Monday night, so how busy could they be? When we arrived they did not seem too busy. They quoted us 30 minutes which was fine by me. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. The bartenders were a bit rude and pretentious! I told them that we were waiting for a table, or even 2 seats at the bar if they opened up. A few minutes later, one of the bartenders came over to us and said that it will be longer than 30 minutes since they forgot about a couple that was ahead of us. So, I finished my drink, spoke a few words to them letting them know how I felt about the situation and we left. All they had to do was accommodate us too for their mistake. I would have accepted an apology too or better yet a gift card. We all make mistakes, but if they tried to make up for it, I wouldn't be giving them 3 stars. Since  I wanted to really check this place out after hearing good things, but after this I am not sure if I will be back."
380,"Outstanding! Our friend brought us here one evening and we all started with foie gras and then shared this massive charcuterie board, the centerpiece being your bison tartare topped with a quail egg. This was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. It bursts in your mouth with unmatched flavor and phenomenal texture. It's like an experience. Unbelievable! 

My only critique, however, is that the foie gras was a bit undercooked. Came out lukewarm, not seared long enough. It's an easily reparable faux pas, we could have sent it back to have them cook it longer. 

The bison more than made up for it though, kind of sealed my opinion, to be honest."
381,"I've eaten here before and yes the food is good but the arrogance and pretentious manner of the staff especially with so many choices in Portland reminds me why I only go in maybe yearly. 

A business partner was in town and I took her over as it was close to her hotel. It was freezing out. We arrived around 5:20 - 5:25 and the hostess said she could seat us in a few moments. I stepped into the bar area to check work email & voice messages and the bar tender asked me to leave as they were not open for an other 10 minutes and he meant it. I wasn't sitting down, asking for a drink ... just warming up and checking work emails. Again, wasn't the end of the world but really. 

We left, didn't feel welcomed and really for 1/2 to 2/3 the price there is several great  restaurants within a block or 2 which is exactly what happened 5 minutes later."
382,"We did the walk-in at 5, got there at 5:25 and next table was 8:30. Finally sat at the bar and ordered the chilled seafood tasting platter, foie grais, Maine lobster with chanterelles, heritage pork chop. Everything was fresh, however my pork chop was not rosie in color and was over cooked. It was tough and heritage meat being tough is just wrong. It tasted like any other pork chop and it didn't wow us. The service was great, and the staff was friendly."
383,"We had dinner here this evening based on glowing recommendations from my son and several co-workers. I had tried to make reservations several weeks ago, but they were fully booked. Showed up as a walk-in just after 5 PM, and got two seats at the bar for 5:30 - not bad for such a popular place. 

We started with a charcuterie platter - blueberry cured duck breast, lamb pastrami, and pork terrine - all outstanding.

My wife had the Heritage Pork Leg Steak with sweet potatoes purée and collard greens. 

I ordered the Hanger Steak medium rare. The steak looked perfectly cooked, but I took one bite it was room temperature at best. I informed the bartender, and he offered to have it warmed up for me. I declined as I didn't want the steak to come back overcooked. He also asked if I wanted to order something else which I also declined, just requested that he take my meal off the bill, which he did with no problem. 

Bottom line is I will give this place another shot, but we definitely didn't have the typical experience that others post about this place."
384,"One of the best restaurants in Portland. Coming from DC and having dined at fairly decent number of restaurants in NYC, I would say this restaurant definitely takes it up a notch. Great service and ambience. Love the open kitchen format. This is a sort of a place where you savor your food taking time to relish in the complex flavors. Portions size are perfect what I call European style. 
Wine selection is diverse and so are cocktails. Enjoy the dinner in company of your friends and loved ones."
385,"I'm giving Four Street Four stars! I had heard so many people rave about it here, plus heard it's difficult to get a reservation,so I was intrigued. We had a 7:30 reservation on a Friday night and they happily seated us right away. 
 Our server was super attentive and friendly;especially when my son didn't like the drink he ordered and our server easily allowed him to order another. We shared the marinated flank steak, Atlantic halibut filet and garlic mashed potatoes. After we ordered, we received a basket full of fluffy soft bread with a container of soft butter. When our food arrived, everything  was cooked to perfection and delicious and tender. 
 My only complaints would be that the food arrived a bit too quickly. My son didn't even have his drink yet. Also, $38 for a small piece of halibut seemed a bit steep. Anyway, I would give it another shot here, as I really enjoyed the upscale atmosphere. Also of note, is the large, open style kitchen. Interesting to see how the food is being prepared. I would recommend this place and look forward to trying it again some day."
386,"Okay, I get it. I get the hype. Just ate there recently for the first time, having made my reservation in due time, coupled with having secured a sitter, woo-hoo! The menu was so vast, and well-thought out, it's hard to believe it's constructed each day. The atmosphere is lively, yet cozy, and not stuffy. And everything hit the right note, especially the salads, and I don't normally go out of my way for salads. They take their food seriously at Fore Street but without taking themselves too seriously - definitely a Maine thing!"
387,"Bread was divinne, but certainly would like the option of olive oil vs. butter for bread.​   Had salad and broccoli.  Both very good.  Fish was delicous, perfectly done, though one of my dining mate's salmon was underdone, per his original order.  Had to send back.  Would return.  Too full for dessert, but all sounded good."
388,"While on business I love to sit at the bar and enjoy watching all the action of the servers and good looking people.  Portland is lucky to have such a slick bar and restaurant in the city, so close to center of town.
Great appetizer options and the best selection of bourbon ever.  
Lobster app and pork belly was delicious."
389,Probably the best mussels I have had in my life. Food was all around amazing except for the cold dishes that were a bit salty. Good layout with an open kitchen.
390,"Did not disappoint.  So few restaurants are hopping or have any sort of buzz at the opening hour - Fore Street was the exception.  I was a bit bummed that 6pm was the only reservation we could get, figuring it would be a bit dull and quiet.  Joke was on me.  The lobby and bar were packed and we were sat right away.  The veggie cooler is so cool and then look at all the bread and then holy cow look at the fire in the oven!  The atmosphere was definitely set for an outstanding meal.

Our servers were so friendly and knowledgeable and GOOD.  Cocktail and wine selection was impressive with some special by the glass offerings.  Bread and salt and herbs were fresh and warm.  The menu offerings were so diverse and uniquely prepared.  The fish and mussels were fresh and perfectly cooked.  

Dessert was wonderful but the seafood entrees stole the show.  An absolute treat for seafoodies."
391,"What we liked:
- Great ingredient sourcing!  Most evident in the Maine mushroom sampler with three different mushrooms which was one of the most creative and delicious dishes I have ever had and the most tender and sweet pan seared scallops.  
- Dynamic dishes!  Also tasted the vegetarian option - a spätzle with hen of the woods mushrooms and goat cheese.  Incredible veggie dish.  I had a phenomenal food experience!
- Wine list met expectations.  
- Absolutely awesome atmosphere.  Casual with wood-fired lighting and a consistently delicious aroma throughout the restaurant.  

What needs improvement:
- Service was very slow with bread taking multiple tens of minutes to be delivered when empty on two different occasions.  Server quite disengaged.  
- The primary reason Fore Street does not get five stars from me is dessert.  We ordered the soufflé and got a flourless chocolate cake in a soufflé dish, definitely not a soufflé!!  When choosing the soufflé, I asked if it would take 20-30 minutes and the waiter assured me it would not.  I should have noticed then!

Summary:
Service knocks off half a point for me.  Soufflé knocks off one point bringing me to 3.5 stars.  I rounded up to 4."
392,"Ok. So when you spend $260 for dinner (3 people), it should always be THIS good - GREAT actually. We wanted to get outa town and drove to Portland with the idea of a world class meal in a well known restaurant with our daughter home for holidays. That's what we got. 

When you enter Fore Street, the smell of the wood fire greets you as well as smiling ""happy to help"" faces at the hostess station. 

We started with cocktails or a glass of wine and ordered the first course: mussels and the cold seafood platter. The mussels were plump, perfectly cooked & cleaned and whatever broth they were in I wanted to bathe in. The seafood platter was delicate and very well done. The highlight we agreed was the thin sliced fresh scallop. 

Dinner was: Arctic Char for my wife, my daughter had the whole black bass and I had the wood roasted lamb w a side of gnocchi. 

We finished with Creme brûlée & a cake/milkshake combo. Soup to nuts. Mary Jane, our server really is fantastic. Ask for her. All in all...this is how it's done. Read my review of Legal Harborside. Also expensive but not nearly as great. They could take lessons from here."
393,"My girlfriends and I had an amazing experience at Fore Street. The ingredients were so fresh, the food cooked perfectly, and the drinks were amazing. Some of the things that stand out: 
- Scallops were cooked to perfection
- Cauliflower made me believe that vegetables are good for you
- Mussels should have been my entree as I could have eaten that all day
- Cappuccino was like the cherry on top for the meal  
- Wine where I ordered the special Pinot Noir that was only made for Fore Street (it was worth the $16)

It was great that we came as a group and ordered a lot of the smaller plates to share. It really allowed us to try all the different options Fore Street had to offer.  In terms of restaurant, I would consider this an intimate romantic dining experience. We had a corner booth that gave us a view of the restaurant and the open kitchen."
394,"Fore street is a very cool place. The restaurant itself is very open, has a lot of windows, and just has a good vibe going for it. The food was very good as well. My fiance and I shared the cauliflower soup, the pork belly, and the roasted half chicken. We were very full by the end! The bread is also amazing, don't skip that! 

Portland has so many great dining spots, and we were only in the area for a long weekend. We both decided this meal was good, but it wasn't one of our favorites from the weekend. I think we'd both try it again, if we are in the area, as their menu does change."
395,"Delightful farm-to-table dinner. Emily's service was superb guiding us through all local dishes. Pork loin, Atlantic scallops, mussels, oysters were all delicious. Beautiful interior. Loved how they prepare the meat out in the dining hall."
396,"Fore Street is the real deal. A charming open kitchen fine dining destination in a historic Portland building. A feast for the eyes, for the nose, for the taste buds. Romantic to the max. While the food is pricey, we still considered it a value. Great wine/beer/drinks list, scrumptious bread from Revolution,  and the food is phenomenal. My halibut with pesto was tender and amazing. My companion had skate wing locally sourced and also delectable. We ordered Brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes but had no room. The deserts looked lovely but alas, they will have to wait for another day. Apparently Fore Street pioneered Farm to table in Portland, well they still have it. Highly recommended!"
397,"Aahhh... finally after many years we got in and enjoyed a several course meal for our 20th Anniversary!  We started with fettuccini and little necks which were good. Then we had a mixed green salad with house dressing and an order of the musssels which were fair.  Then we had the pork belly which wad dynamite!  For entrées, my wife had all five selected veggie dishes and I had the hanger steak, all of which were excellent!  We topped it off with strawberry short cake and a cheesecake. The cheesecake was excellent and the strawberry shortcake was OK. All in all it was a very good meal with excellent service and it was fun to watch everyone working very hard in the open kitchen to make everyone's meal pleasant!"
398,"Arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were quickly seated. Our appetizer came in short order but it was another hour before our entrees came.  Our meals were tasty, but for the size of the portions overpriced.  We had to wait another 15 minutes for our plates to be cleared, at which point we asked for our check.  After waiting another 15 minutes for our server to pick up our credit card, we dug up the cash so we could leave. Although our meal was good, service was slow ( server very busy) and it was very noisy.  With so many other choices in Portland, not planning on returning soon."
399,"This is a love story. It begins in the city of Portland. I've eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world, and this one of my favorites.  I've got nothing but praise for Fore street.  Thank you for taking the care to make sure everything on our plates was mind blowing."
400,"Amazing! 
We went to Scales for a special celebration for our anniversary. Our waiter, Ben was just delightful. The food was savory and we enjoyed every bite. 
We ordered the baked haddock, Maine halibut, local oysters, salmon belly appetizer and primly pear sorbet for dessert. 
Lovely relaxing atmosphere on the waters edge. 
A special spot and savory menu!"
401,"No complains about the food here, just slightly overpriced.

As I wasn't too hungry that day, I ordered the fluke ceviche and the daily special of duck agnolotti pasta appetizer as my dinner. If you really like the flavor and sweetness of pineapples, you will love the fluke ceviche. For me, I felt that the dish lacked acidity, and was more like fish in a very sweet sauce.

The duck agnolotti pasta with foie gras and morel mushrooms was on a totally different level, it was a dish bursting with umami and richness in comparison. The pasta was cooked al dente, and had a generous amount of filling. This was an appetizer sized pasta and it was the perfect portion size since it was so rich. I usually hate peas, but I loved the addition of peas on top as it was a nice burst of freshness in contrast to the creamy sauce. Order this if they have it available!

Dishes that others at the table had: pan baked lobster (this is 1.5 pounds of lobster if you're wondering!), lobster roll, seafood stew, halibut.
The scallop entrée looked really good, I would get that next time if I visited again."
402,"Where do I start?  What a meal!  Nothing about tonight wasn't excellent. Our server Julie started the night off great, expertly describing the specials of the day before we even got into the menus. She then gave us enough time to look over the drink menu before she came back to take them. 

We started with the Brown Bread and she warned us that the order only came came with two pieces, but would gladly get us more if we wanted it. I wouldn't normally be willing to pay for bread, but it was so good we ordered another order of it. The flavor was out of this world. We also got the sApp special of the day which was a scallop fritter (more funnel cake). It too was outstanding. It had chunks of scallop in each bite and the Jalapeño Aioli drizzled on top was an excellent addition. 

The entree that each of us ordered were equally as excellent. My son got the Pan Roasted Maine Hake, which he raves about, and the bite I stole was great. My DIL got the Seared Scallops and they too were great. It came with a lot of scallops, the sauce and pork belly were great and she said the kale added the perfect earthy tone. I got the Baked Haddock which may have been the best fish dish I have eaten. The flavor of the fish, the sauce that it was cooked in, the rutabaga, mushrooms and leeks made for a killer flavor combo. 

Dessert was equally wonderful. We had the Baked Alaska which they made with their custard of the day, Maple Walnut. Great flavor!  We also got the wild Blueberry Custard which I would eat everyday!

Great meal and although not inexpensive, I felt like I got a deal based on the service and the flavors of the meal."
403,"One of the best restaurant experiences we've had. 
We came to Scales on a Tuesday night and were immediately sat. 
The ambiance was great, a nice restaurant but not overly fancy feeling and well lit. The kitchen is also an open concept and all of the oysters and fish is on ice at the front. 

We sat and each ordered glass of wine. The wine list was huge and really well priced. 
We started with 1/2 dozen oysters (2 of each that they have- they have 3 rotating choices- so we each got to have one of each). 
The oysters were very good and all local. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the seared scallops, which came with squash, pancetta, and kale in a delicious cream sauce. She orders scallops any time it's on a menu and said this was potentially  the best she's had. 
I ordered the seared tuna (part of the raw bar menu and an appetizer/small plate) and the Brussels sprouts side as a DIY entree. 
The tuna was perfectly seared and tasted so fresh. The Brussels sprouts were also great, shaved and cooked perfectly (browned) with big, delicious pieces of duck. 

Since everything was so great, we felt we had to have dessert. We ordered the chocolate crémeux, which was rich but accompanied with many things that balanced it out. We also had a dessert wine to go with it (Colosi Passito Mascato), which was fantastic. 

On top of everything, our server was so sweet and really helpful in guiding us through ordering. 

I will - no question - return when I am back in Portland. I just left the restaurant and am already thinking about my next visit."
404,"While I had visited for happy hour several times, I hadn't experienced entrees at Scales since opening week, several years ago. This is the restaurant you take someone to impress, especially out of towners. It's a gorgeous, wide open new building directly on the ocean. There's really no discussion...this is the most stunning restaurant in the city of Portland and should be your first choice as a seafood destination. It's a class above a place like Eventide and a much better atmosphere than sister restaurants Street and Co. and Fore Street. 

With the above being said, as a local, I wouldn't come for entrees again unless someone else is paying. At $32-$38 for most items, which includes only a minimal side, it's just too expensive for anything besides a special occasion. The arctic char, haddock and hake were all excellent, and about as good and fresh as you'll find in the city. If you're visiting Portland, stop reading and make a reservation (and you'll definitely need one).

For me, the happy hour and/or bar is a great up""scale"" (couldn't resist) year round choice. It's a gorgeous stone bar and oysters are shucked directly in front of you on a pile of ice placed in a crevice. From 4 pm-6 pm in winter, it's $1 oysters with various wine and beer options at $6. The appetizers, priced $9-$16, are much more reasonable and great for sharing. In order of preference:
-Mussels: a massive portion in an oversized cast iron skillet with perhaps the best bread I've ever tasted, baked across the street at Standard.
-Seared Tuna: melts in your mouth. I can't think of a better version, anywhere.
-Fried Cauliflower: decent, but not exceptional. Similar items at Central Provisions are better.
-Salt Cod Croquettes: too salty for my taste.
-On different visits, the fried clams and fried squid have been excellent.

Service has been perfected to a science, led by manager Alexa. They've ditched the silly team of servers and transitioned to a traditional method. Bartender Sam is a Portland icon and is way cooler on his worst day then I'll ever be on my best. Scales would be loved in Boston. We're lucky to have it in Portland."
405,"I've been to Scales several times and have never been dissapointed! I most recently dropped in for my birthday and it was just a wonderful meal from start to finish. 

The brown bread was a tasty starter with a solid flavor of molasses. My mom ordered the sea food stew which was served in a cast iron skillet and she loved every bite. 

The baked lobster was filling and not too heavy on the breading. 

We ended the meal with a dessert of baked alaska that had the most amazing toffee flavored icecream inside. 

If you're looking for a great meal on the water Scales would be my pick!"
406,"Loved the brown bread (2 warm and crispy pre-buttered, 2"" disks), crab fritters (3 crispy pieces with cool tartar sauce and herbs), seafood stew (mussels, clams, squid, and white fish in a heavenly smoky tomato broth with a well-buttered piece of crunchy bread), and lemon mousse dessert (served on top of shortbread and paired with a delightfully tart berry sorbet). The space and server were wonderful, too. 

However, the duck confit brussels were oily and felt somewhat one-note, and the hake was a beautiful piece of fish just drowning in a brown butter soup. The toasted hazelnuts and roasted potatoes were wonderful accompaniments, but the look and taste of all that brown butter was a real turn off with that dish. 

Would definitely come back to try other dishes, but would avoid those two."
407,"Came here for happy hour and to try my first oyster! 

At first it took the bar staff a really long time to come over and take our order, despite the bar being empty, which annoyed me a little but I was in no rush. When they asked what we would like to drink, I asked ""What is Milk Punch?"" because it was the only cocktail on the happy hour menu and I have never heard of it. They told me today it was a pineapple milk punch. We stared at each other blankly. I was expecting her to tell me if there was actually milk in it or what kind of alcohol was in it. I finally just asked if there was actually milk in it, to which she said yes but it's strained out. By this point I just said screw it and ordered it anyways - I was being adventurous today and it was actually very good!

After this interaction we were only served by other bartenders and they were all phenomenal. I told the man who brought us our oysters that it was my first time trying one and he gave us lots of good tips and info. We also ordered clam chowder and calamari. Clam chowder was amazing and the calamari was just good. 

Overall I really liked the ambiance and the oysters were delicious. I will definitely come back sometime to have a full meal!"
408,"Had the chance to eat at Scales during a recent business trip. Each day that I was at work I was told 3-4 times that I needed to try and get into this place to eat. I was fortunately able to get a reservation late one night right before they closed. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to eat off their menu. The server suggested a special appetizer that they had that night which was a fried branzino on top of sweet/spicy slaw. I went with his suggestion and ordered that and then also ordered 3 raw oysters and 3 raw clams since I had never tried either raw before. My main dish I ordered was the Seared Scallop entree. 

The fried branzino was phenomenal. Like easily one of the best appetizers I had during my business trip. The branzino wasn't super heavy feeling and the slaw was really tasty. The raw oysters and clams were presented on a very appealing platter. I just however decided raw oysters and clams aren't for me and that is nothing against Scales. The Seared Scallop entree was one of my favorite entrees I had during my trip. The scallops were seared to perfection and the combination of mushrooms, bacon, spinach, and parsnip cream sauce was delicious. Towards the end I had a lot of sauce remaining on my plate so I ordered the cloverleaf rolls which helped remedy that situation. 

Overall this is a must visit place when you are in Portland. I've heard they are incredibly busy most nights so plan ahead and make reservations and if they are full they are usually able to fit you in before closing if you don't mind a late dinner. It is definitely worth it. The only thing I disliked was that their soda was ridiculously expensive. They charge per glass, I had two glasses which was the equivalent of about two 12 oz. cans.This is my biggest gripe considering I spent over $70 at this restaurant. Next time I would probably just stick with water."
409,"THE FOOD IS AMAZING! Dining at scales is not just dinner, it's an experience. Their food literally tasted like art

Service: A, making a reservation was easy. Our waiter was attentive and personable. 
Food: A+ my boyfriend and I got the mussels, octopus grilled (highly recommend), lobster stew, raw halibut ceviche, and raw tuna. My family got the fish sandwiches and scallops which they enjoyed. Everything was good. Even the rolls melted in my mouth perfectly. 
Atmosphere: A, high ceilings, cozy lighting, clean, big windows showing the waterfront
Price: expensive but worth it for what you get 
Parking: complementary valet
Menu: lots of options! Even if you don't like seafood there are some choices for you 

They did charge 3 dollars a person to cut my birthday cake which bugged me little since we dropped $270+ but I guess that's understandable bringing outside food into their place. 

Thanks scales! I'll be back to try more"
410,"If you can stand the waiting, it's worth it. I promise, it's worth it.  Or I guess you could be a good human and make reservations.  #NoReservations

I've never been to a restaurant where the bar had its own waiting list that went passed an hour.  So you can eat in their dining room, the bar or the waiting area near the bar with low tables.  But rather than awkwardly eating in front of our coffee table mates, we waited because we wanted to give our food the proper respect.  I'm not going to go into full detail on everything, because I totally could.  Just know that they serve excellent quality seafood here.  While the price is high, the food is absolutely worth it.  Also worth mentioning is the wonderful staff.  Although it was incredibly busy, every server/bartender we came across was friendly and knowledgeable.

Them scallops tho..."
411,"So glad i found this place on Yelp and ended up coming here!! We were looking for a dinner spot during our quick trip in Maine that would have a nice menu of classic lobster dishes, soups, and some other seafood dishes. This place fit the bill and boy did it not disappoint!

We did not have reservations on a Saturday evening but were able to get seated within 5 minutes - though this may have been due to the rainy weather and maybe not being as busy, it was very nice that we didn't have to wait a while. 

As soon as you walk in you're greeted by a huge
Box of frozen seafood on display and a nice open seating space (big windows with views of the water) - It reassures you that you're in for a fresh dining experience. 

We ordered clam chowder, lobster stew, grilled octopus, crab fritters as our appetizers, and steamed lobster and scallop dish as our entrees. Baked Alaska and frozen blueberry custard as dessert. Everything was so delicious especially the entrees and the octopus and crab fritter appetizers! The fritter was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside full of crab flavor. The sauces for all the dishes were very complementary and you can tell care was taken into every bite and presentation. This may honestly have been better than some Michelin restaurants I've been to for a way cheaper price in terms of freshness, taste, and quality! 

I looked through other reviews for popular spots for Eventide oyster co, etc but if ur looking for a slightly elevated, sit-down experience for a very reasonable price with quality seafood, look no further!! Staff was pleasant/friendly, seating was hassle-free, interior design was nice, and dining was EXCELLENT and satisfactory. I'm surprised scales does not have higher ratings. Yum!!"
412,"Not only did this place not wow me, there were things that just made it a bad experience.

The restaurant itself is lovely with lots of windows and sunlight.  Free valet parking makes it very convenient.

My family was up in Portland for vacation so we were a party of 12.  I looked at the menu ahead of time online and was excited about the short rib and duck entrees.  While it's a seafood restaurant, I wasn't in a seafood mood.  When we were seated, I was disappointed to not see the entrees that I saw online, but know menus are subject to change so I didn't think anymore of it.  I was avoiding shellfish and am lactose intolerant so my choices were limited, especially with no changes to the entrees.  I settled on the sockeye salmon which was over cooked and salty.  Most of my family enjoyed their dishes however.  

As we were wrapping up, we noticed someone at the next table got the whole fried fish.  It wasn't on our menu so that's when we asked our waitress how that table got the dish.  She then explained the rule of a limited menu for parties of 12 or more... and that it should have been explained when the reservation was made.  I didn't make the reservation so not sure if it was properly explained.  Since they were a party of 8, they got the regular menu.  

Whether the limited menu was explained or not, I think it's bullshit that a party that is spending more money doesn't get to order what they want.  From what I recall, the limited menu does not include the whole fried fish, seafood stew, duck, short rib, or any of the sandwiches.  We had 3 kids with us and my sister had even asked if there was a kids menu / smaller portions and our waitress said no, knowing that the ""regular menu"" offered sandwiches that would be better portioned for kids.  So instead of being able to get the fish sandwich with fries my young nephew had to go with the full order of fish and chips.  And instead of getting the short ribs, I was getting something I didn't want.

When you drop $800 at a restaurant, you expect more and you expect to be treated equally and not considered as an inconvenience to the kitchen.  

Thank you for making us feel so special as customers who create such inefficiencies for you  to the point that you print special limited menus for us!"
413,My wife and I are at Scales tonight.  We both felt the food and overall experience was good.  The experience was not great considering the prices.  There was a lady walking around monitoring the progress of diners and it bothered my wife - she felt pushed.  Our service was good and the food was good but I think everything is all about expectations and my expectations were higher than what I experienced.
414,"The haddock was not completely fresh.  The hassleback potato was crisp and delicious.   The baked Alaska was a poor substitute as the ""meringue"" was soggy like marshmallow and overly sweet rather than being crisp and light like true baked Alaska. The waitress was prompt but seemed brusque and patronizing at times.  We have dined at some of the finest restaurants around the world and are gourmet cooks ourselves so know what real baked Alaska is like and the waitress said "" well everyone else always loves it, and is is meringue"". The scallops were wonderful."
415,"Despite having a seemingly endless selection of places to eat, it is tricky to find a nice place to have a group dinner in this city.  Portland is home to a bunch of small local restaurants, which makes it awesome, but also makes it hard to get a reservation for a group.   Enter Scales.

Scales is one of those restaurants that is great for corporate dinners, taking your family when they visit from out-of-state, or celebrating a special occasion in a large group.  The space is large and open, and the tables are moveable, which lends itself well to group dining. Scales is fancy enough to impress, but still relaxed enough for everyone to feel comfortable.  

Scales is one of the better places to get seafood in town, and perhaps the best place that's right on the water.  Everything is extremely fresh, as in you can see the fish displayed in the front of the restaurant fresh.  I am a big fan of their Arctic Char.  As pretty much every other reviewer has said, this is not a place to skip dessert.  I love their frozen custard and seasonal desserts."
416,"Ok I am going to preface this with the fact that if you are looking for something inexpensive and are on a tight budget, then this place is definitely not for you otherwise this place is the bees knees!

The service is impeccable, the restaurant, bar area and bathroom are immaculate and clean and the view is something to behold out on the water at the end of the pier.

The layout of the restaurant is all open glassed where it is naturally lit from ear to ear and would be an amazing place to bring a date to if they are worth forking over some loot.

I had the scallops dish and I was in LOVE with this dish, the creamy broth and the veggies that were sautéed with them were delicate and delicious and the scallops were cooked to perfection.

There were many things that we had at the table (we were a table of 8) like seared ahi tuna that was encrusted in peppercorns and the fish and chips that was light and fluffy with the batter not being too greasy and fatty.

I paired my scallops with a glass of shiraz but had an Allagash for beer during the main course.  

If you are looking at a date night or a special event downtown Portland right on the water, then check this place out, just bring your wallet filled with some cash."
417,"We celebrated a belated Valentine's Day with an early dinner at one of the few restaurants we haven't tried in Portland, Scales! We've heard a lot about this place especially since it's the sister restaurant from one of our favorites, Street & Co. Let us tell you, Scales quickly climbed to one of our top restaurants in town :D We came with an appetite so we started with 1/2 of a dozen of oysters, the buttery Cloverleaf Rolls, the Casco Bay Lobster Stew, and the Grilled Octopus with Chorizo. The butterfield oysters were perfect with the right balance of sweetness and brine. The rolls paired perfectly with the soup, which was creamy and filled with fresh lobster meat. And even though Grilled Octopus is one of our favorite appetizers... this one was perfect!! For the main courses, we picked the Seared Scallops and Seafood Stew. The Seared Scallop was one of the best meals we've had in town- the parsnip cream was flavorful but light and paired perfectly with the assortment of king oyster mushroom, squash, and bacon. The Seafood Stew was hearty and captured all of the flavors of the sea, ranging from clams, to mussels, to squid and whitefish. Let's just say this won't be our last time coming, as all of this was topped with a perfect setting with a beautiful view of the sea :))"
418,Wow!! This place is outstanding if you're a seafood lover. Everything we ordered was superb. The restaurant is kind of tucked away in an alley by the water. As you come in you notice a beautiful dining area with an open kitchen. The service was top notch and the dessert was out of this world. My wife ordered the special gnocchi bolognese which was very tasty and I ordered their version of chipino which is a must if you enjoy seafood swimming in a savory tomato sauce that's out of this world with flavor. It's my top restaurant in Portland ME. Highly recommend this place!!
419,"This is an all around solid restaurant. The food, the atmosphere, and the price all make it a good choice when visiting Portland.

The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, but it's also a place you could dress up a bit and not feel out of place. The wait staff was all very friendly and helpful.

Food was delicious. We had the rolls to start (droooooollll), asparagus salad and oysters as an appetizer, and halibut for main.  The asparagus salad was very fresh  and light. Loved it. Oysters were well shucked and tasty. The halibut was the star of the show. Perfectly cooked with a great and unique flavor.  

For dessert we shared the banana sundae and chocolate pave. Both were good.  Chocolate was very beautifully plated, and the banana sundae was just so good. 

Price point is not cheap by any means, but the food is worth the price tag."
420,"Came in for a nice family dinner on Friday night. Did not have a reservation and were able to walk in and seat 4 right away. The decor of this restaurant is very nice. It is on a wharf on the harbor. 

We ordered the cod special and the seafood stew. Both dishes were 5/5. Overall service was great and dishes were delicious.  I would highly recommend Scales to anyone looking for a great seafood meal in Portland, Maine."
421,"I don't think there are any bad places to eat in Portland Maine, just because it has great seafood everywhere. We stopped in at scales after taking a cruise on the bay, and stayed for dinner. Everything we had was very delicious. The Lobster bisque had a whole lobster claw. Now that's a lobster bisque."
422,"One of my favorite dining experience in Portland. Will definitely return.. 
I will suggest it to all my friends. Check out the picture I was able to capturec"
423,"This is the greatest seafood restaurant I have ever been to during my trip to New England. This restaurant has completely changed my perspective on how seafood could be made and I judge future seafood based solely on my experiences here at this restaurant. As you can see from my photos we ordered a medley of appetizers and entrees. This chef pays great attention to the seafood dining experience. Every dish I ordered had 1 amazing aspect in common- the star of every dish was fresh, sweet, plump- seafood. The seasonings in each dish worked to simply highlight the seafood- not overpower it. The oysters were extremely fresh and naturally sweet- I need not use any sauces. The mussels were extremely fresh- with no sand- very plump! I just absolutely love the chef's take on dessert! They were all recompose dishes of American classics. From the s'mores, to the fruit pie, to the lemon tart- they were remade and repackaged into extremely high end desserts.

When my family and I look back at this trip we will all bring up ""the dinner at scales"" to be one of he most memorable experiences in New England.

Highly recommended- i am saddened I was not able o try every dish and envious of the local's ability to do so.

Enjoy!"
424,"I literally had the best meal of my life here.  The freshest oysters, the most amazing chowder, incredible mussels, and oh god the whole fish.  A Dorade in the most buttery and delicious sauce of all time.  I implore you to not miss this place.  In my opinion, still the best Portland has to offer."
425,"My second dining experience at Scales was much different / better than my first.  I think, in part, because we sat outside on the deck.  It's much quieter out there, inside is so loud it's hard to have a conversation.  When I went to the bathroom then walked back on the deck I was so happy we were outside so we could actually hear each other talk.  I got the lobster salad, it was fresh & flavorful with a good portion of lobster it came with creamy fingerling potatoes, oranges, frisee & champagne vinaigrette.  It all came together nicely, I'd get this again.  It was reasonably priced at $19.  The wine spritzer, however, was a ridiculous $14!  It was a nice, relaxing evening and I can honestly say I'd only eat there again if the deck is open.  Inside is much to chaotic & noisy, not relaxing at all."
426,"Definitely a higher end restaurant with entrees from $20-40. The food is EXCEPTIONAL!! So delicious, we got fried whole belly clams, scallops, and their homemade bread. The scallops were above and beyond. I would get  them everyday if I could. I definitely recommend getting it with their bread and a glass of wine. You won't be disappointed."
427,"Truly a top notch experience, from atmosphere, to service, to delicious food! The restaurant, like the others in this group, is really stylish, and the decor carries over to the server uniforms, and the starched and pressed head chef overseeing it all from the open kitchen. 

Service was impeccable. Attentive in a non-intrusive way, and helped us feel festive during our joint birthday celebration. Our server even brought us candles on saucers at the end, such a nice touch!! 

Food was great. I believe we ordered mostly specials, but our favorite bite of the night was the yucca fritter on the octopus dish, which is on the menu. Cannot recommend this dish enough! 

Don't skip dessert! The butterscotch Sundae was out of this world, and the corn pudding was really tasty, and something totally different, for me.

Great cocktails, terrific wine selection, and just a great vibe all around. Will continue to visit restaurants in this group whenever I'm in town!"
428,"Went to Portland for a night wanted to try some of the new dining spots that are popping up all over and we came across this place while out sampling some craft beers. When the 4 of us got there we were warmly greeted by the hostess who got us seated where Tommy took over from that point. We put in our drink orders which was a glass of white wine and 2 Battery Steel beers (craft beer list is below average) we all put in our orders fish and chips, lobster stew and fresh garden salad and 1.5 lb lazy lobster and I did the Halibut. Tommy brought all drinks in a timely manner and soon after the kitchen staff brought us our meals which all looked hot and tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food with not much conversation as we were so focused on our meals. I would like to point out portions are very small to below average. My halibut steak was about 6 to 8 OZs most meals come with zero sides so if you want a side or something to accommodate your meal make sure you order something. Tommy offered us desert as most us were still hungry because of the small portions and they were out of the Baked Alaska so we ordered a night cap and headed on our way. Tommy was a very good server who was knowledgeable about the menu."
429,"The food here is amazing! Every dish was a feast for the eyes and taste buds. The octopus was so soft and tender. It was slightly chard but not burnt and the fried balls of potato just melts in your mouth. The muscles were fat, juicy, tender and properly cleaned. Thick slabs bacon of onion was added to the Seafood Stew to create a burst of flavor. My favorite was the scallops which was seared just enough to form a crispy crust but not long enough to overcook. The thick white sauce made with cubs of pork belly, corn, mushrooms and string beans was the perfect combination for the scallops. Thick cuts of bread is all you need to mop up the sauce for a perfect ending. Finally, if you still have room, the desserts is worth trying. From a comforting warm cobbler to deconstructed takes on classics such as s'more and lemon tart, it is worth the extra calories."
430,"Oh. My. Lanta. This place is GOOD.
I am always skeptical of restaurants that are this expensive- will it live up to the hype, is the food worth it, is there a chance I'll meet my future sugar daddy here (kidding...sort of).
However, Scales definitely lived up to the hype and then some! The drinks were delicious, the food was divine and the service was on par for what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment.
Our party of four started with:
Anadama bread- a bread so delicious already its hard to mess up, which they did not. Amazing slice of corn meal and molasses heaven
Fried oysters- I had never had oysters fried before because they are so good raw why mess with a good thing? However these were amazing.
Steamed clams- I don't know how, but these clams had the biggest bellies I've ever had with clams, and we didn't even need to clean them in clam water!
Tempura soft shell crab- So good
Halibut tartine- still not sure what tartine is but this was good
Everyone got a different entree and shared a bit of our food with everyone else and I can say that I would have been happy with any of the choices:
Roasted lobster
Grilled swordfish with mole
Seared scallops
Fried whole fish (filleted right at the table)

This is a great place for a special occasion or fancy meal"
431,"Where do I even begin? Benjamin was attentive, considerate, helpful, and fun. The food and the service was 10/10. Favorites include the lobster chowder, the crab fritters and the Brussel sprouts. There is no wrong entree, dessert or cocktail that you can order here. On a SCALE of 1-amazing, we will be back. Ty Ben~"
432,"Fantastic meal! Favorite of the whole trip.

We had oysters, lobster and scallops. The scallops were delectable. The oysters and lobster weren't bad either :)

My friend got the lobster but wasn't really sure what she was doing. Instead of asking for help, a waiter who was passing by backtracked when he saw her struggle with the cracker. Good looking out! 

Drinks were really good here too!"
433,"Scales does dollar oysters (bar and lounge only) from 4-6 during the week and it's fantastic.
The service was excellent. The oysters were ALL local and delicious. (Most dollar oysters spots in town were Virginia oysters so I was pretty thrilled). 
We can't personally afford to eat entrees here but that's not their fault! And they all looked absolutely DELICIOUS. 

We're glad to just get to the bar for the dollar feasting! Thanks scales!"
434,"I would call Very few restaurants ""memorable "" but I must say Scales fit into that category. First trip to Portland so on a couple of recommendations we chose Scales which is a Great space on the water. Our server Julie was amazing. Her guidance with specials and the menu coupled with her personality made us feel comfortable and welcomed to be dining there from the moment we were seated. We started with 2 shared appetizers for the 4 of us  and moved on to 4 great meals in generous portions. Rarely do we get dessert but had to and they did not disappoint. Overall we all walked away with nothing but rave reviews about the evening."
435,"My boyfriend took my here for the first time on Valentine's Day, and we have been back several times since. They change their menu seasonally so don't fall in love with something, because the next time you go in it could be different. They have valet parking which is great, because parking in this part of the city can be challenging. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a very nice hostess, and you see the fresh fish right in front of you. Some of the seating areas aren't the greatest as they are very close to other people, but we love the food so we don't mind. The clover leaf rolls we had were to die for, we actually ordered a second order of them they were so good. Oddly enough my boyfriend always orders the steak dish and said it is at the top of his list for how good it is. The bone marrow they give you on the side is what he loves. I always order the scallop dish, they melt in your mouth they are so good! Dessert is also delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you order here."
436,"Scales is perfect every time. The preparation of their octopus is the best, and the way they present oysters! Scales is like an extension of my physical and metaphorical home."
437,"Bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable about the local beers.  
Also, had the grilled octopus and it was out of this world.  Unbelievably good!"
438,Cool building! Wish they had more variety of oysters! Atmosphere was great enjoyed the experience!
439,"Of the Street Restaurant Group restaurants, Scales sits in the middle for me.  Scales isn't as charming as Fore Street (or as tasty), but the food is better here than it is at Street & Co.  To me, Scales is one of those places where the food plays second fiddle to the atmosphere.  In other words, you come here mostly because it is right on the pier and has giant windows looking out over the water.

We shared an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts and the desserts were really all that was memorable (to be honest, I can't even remember what my husband ordered as an entree!).  My scallop dish was gorgeous, and the portion more than generous, but I've had much better scallops in Portland.  Entrees are in the $30 range, and in this city, I expect to be wowed for that price.  The desserts, on the other hand, are fantastic.  They are similar in quality to those at Fore Street, which is my favorite place to get fancy dessert.  Most of the dessert menu changes with the season, but they always have homemade frozen custard - it shouldn't be missed!

I would highly recommend going to Scales for pre-dinner drinks (those views!) or after-dinner dessert, either of those is sure to impress!"
440,"I went to Scales this past Saturday night for an early dinner. 

The restaurant was tucked away down a wharf but was easy to find. The decor was really cute. we chose to sit at the bar and didn't have to wait long for a seat and the bartender had offered us a cocktail while we waited. We both got a martini with fig in it which we loved .

We started with a scallop and mushroom appetizer special which was tasty and fragrant. 

I was craving a lobster roll - there's was delicious. Warm, buttery, generous serving of lobster and a little mayo. The fries accompanying the roll were also delicious. 

My boyfriend got the scallop entree. There were a fair amount of scallops and the presentation was lovely. He didn't love the taste. The combination of flavors didn't really do it for us. 

Overall, the service was great and the food (at least what I ordered!) was tasty...4 stars!"
441,"My date and I had the most perfect dinner at Scales last night! We were vacationing and only had one opportunity for dinner, and I am SO glad we went this route. Here we go:

Wine: my last name is Colombo so anytime the Rhône Jean luc Colombo is any menu ANYWHERE, I order it. It is also luckily quite inexpensive and DELSIH. We ordered a bottle, it was lovely. 

Apps: we went with the Chowder, crab fritters, 1/2 dozen clams and green salad. I personally loved the red wine vinaigrette on the salad. Crab fritter were at the recommendation of our server and rich as heck. Amazing. The chowder was a bit thinner than the other chowder we had in Portland, but unique and wonderful and fish filled. Clams were fishy (like how clams are) and served on ice.

Dinner: we split the roasted lobster for dinner with a side of Broccoline/Guanciale and WOWWWWWW. Ritz cracker goodness and the MOST amazing flavor. It was my first ever lobster and the best ever. I felt spoiled and left covered in butter. Decorum went out the window. It was fine. The greens were good too but LOBSTER. 

Service the whole time was on point and people in Portland are just so nice. We got great gelato recommendations and went on our way. I won't forget the meal and am so grateful to Scales for making our night in Portland so special!"
442,"Absolutely outstanding meal! I'm so happy we decided to eat here on one of only two nights we had in Portland. It definitely gets busy here but they do everything they can to accommodate you. I called for reservations, and when there were no times I wanted available the hostess kindly told me to just come in when we wanted and they would find a seat for us. Thats exactly what we did, we did wait about 30 minutes but we got seated promptly after that. The space is pretty big and has a big bar to wait in. I love how the kitchen is open so you can watch them cook, there is also lobster cages and fresh fish on ice. Our sever John was awesome, very attentive and nice. We had clam chowder to start, delicious! Then we got the scallops and the Halibut for entrees, both were phenomenal! Those were by far the best scallops I've had and there were at least 6 or 7, they did not skimp at all. Same for the Halibut, amazing sauce with toasted hazelnuts. I wish we had room for dessert but sadly did not. If you're only in town for one night, I highly recommend this place, you won't be sorry."
443,"After a week long luxury vacation, this was our favorite restaurant for the food.  The tables are way too close together and there is absolutely no privacy, but the food is terrific.  

We started with two of the appetizer specials.  One was a fluke dish and the other was a fish sashimi.  These were a great starting point and were perfectly prepared and flavored.  We then moved to the oysters- with a selection of all three available that day.  Again - beautiful!  Our main course was the lobster roll for both of us.  After the week long vacation up the coast - these still remain our favorite - they were really flavorful and perfect.  We finished with steamed lobster for dessert - this was the best part of the entire meal - I highly recommend this. 

Additionally - the service was really nice.  The front desk staff was friendly and helpful and our server couldn't have been nicer.

My advice: Go for the food, ignore the ambiance. Have lobster as dessert."
444,"I like my fish, it is a nice atmosphere,busy, hustle,
Open concept. Friendly wait staff
Beer selection is lame, need better options.
Fish entree's are pricey , I mean it is Maine not NYC.
Overall I would say it is a good experience."
445,"Great place to eat.   We had a great meal here.  It is pricey but for good food, we are happy to pay the price.   The atmosphere is great.  Large open space with a bar, dining room and open kitchen.  When you walk in you can see you soon to be meal, swimming or already on ice.  The food couldn't be fresher than if you caught it yourself.
    My daughter had a hamburger and fries.  The fries were homemade and really good.    My husband and I both had the lobster stew. I was expecting more in it than a few pieces of lobster.  When I hear stew, I expect meat and veggies.  It was good, but I don't think it is something that I would order again.  
   For entrees, I had the scallop dish.  It was out of this world.    I love scallops and have them when I can.   This was the first time I got more than 3 on my plate at a restaurant.  I got the lobster stew because usually when I order scallops somewhere I leave the table hungry because there are so few.  Not this time.  They were perfectly cooked and more than enough.   I wish I could remember what the sauce under them was, but I can't.     The whole dish was spectacular.    I would highly recommend it.
   My husband got a mix from the raw bar of oysters and clams.  He said they were really fresh and enjoyed every bite.
   As we were leaving, our daughter got to listen to one of the chef's explaining how they choose their fish and were it is supplied from.  She said it was fascinating and interesting.  She is a 10 year old who loves science and environmental topics. She loves cooking shows so this was right up her alley.
    When we make it back to Portland in the future, this will be on our list to visit again.  
  I highly recommend it."
446,"Scales is a beautiful restaurant and even has fish and seafood on ice when you walk in so you know it's fresh. But don't worry, there's no fishy smell or anything to ruin your meal. There's lots of seating so we didn't have any wait, which was nice. And our server was very attentive and helpful. 

We ordered the clam chowder and lobster stew. I loved the stew and it had lots of sizable chunks of lobster. Definitely got your moneys worth there. The chowder was good too but I definitely prefer the lobster stew. We also ordered the Maine scallops (served with pork belly, pearl onions, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. Seasoned a little heavily but nothing unbearable. The scallops, however, seemed a bit overdone... not ""melt in your mouth"" as other reviews have stated but still, really good and worth it. However, we ordered the Brussels sprouts with duck confit and it was SO SALTY. It was so salty that we ordered dessert (chocolate frozen custard with almonds and toasted coconut) to offset the saltiness before attempting to finish our meal. The server said they have received comments about it in the past and it comes up every once in awhile, saying some chefs are tasting so many dishes and have a higher tolerance to salt... i don't think that should be an excuse and it is definitely something that should be addressed. Overall, everything was good but I probably wouldn't take my chances with the Brussels sprouts again."
447,Overall I really enjoy the aesthetic and the experience of scales but it's not the best food I've ever had or even the best ive had in Portland. The location is beautiful inside - right on the docks where you can see fishermen unloading the daily catch. The fresh fish and lobsters and oysters on display is beautiful and gets you excited to try. The interior of the restaurant is sleek and modern and has high Windows perfect for watching the sunset right on the ocean. The cornbread was lovely and warm and very cute. I do wish they'd brought us three though since we were a party of three and they only brought 2. The smoked salmon appetizer was average. The salmon was fresh enough but the star of the dish was the farm tomatoes. The scallops were delicious - I enjoyed the corn that added lightness but found the overall dish too heavy with the dairy or butter sauce. The halibut was average. Definitely not a problem with the portion but the fish felt over cooked and drowned in butter and sauce. The lack of green on the plate also felt heavy and without a new texture or break from the fish. The steak was fine and the potatoes were well cooked but I wouldn't order it again. Overall a great experience but not the most exciting food. Come here for drinks and the view.
448,"Some old classmates were in town from DC so we decided to make a reservation at Scales to give them a sampling of some good food and even better atmosphere on the water. We weren't disappointed. 

The place was busy (late on a Tuesday) but we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt in taking our drink order. We looked through the menu and decided to sample some items from the raw bar as well as the regular menu. First course included oysters (all Maine and all 3 types were exceptional) tuna tartare, octopus with chorizo and clam chowder. The chowder was simply divine and the tartare was so fresh and so well balanced it might be the best I've ever tasted.  The hands down favorite, though, was the octopus. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and ever so subtly balanced in flavors with the chorizo, hazelnuts and a balsamic reduction. So. Amazing. Everything came out quickly and was served promptly. 

Entrees were a bit less adventurous, though equally delicious. We ordered both steamed and roasted lobsters as well as the baked haddock. The lobsters were amazing (no surprise) and the baked lobster is absolutely something that should be on any foodie's bucket list. Rich, savory texture and flavor topped with crunchy breadcrumbs - so good. But the star entree was the haddock. Served in a cast iron gratin with morels, fingerling potatoes and leeks swimming in a rich delicious cream sauce - this dish was pure heaven. I'd go back just for this. Seriously. It was the most ingenious presentation of haddock I've ever seen. 

We decided to sample dessert as well - blueberry crumble and a butterscotch sundae. Both were incredibly good. The crumble was warm and comforting and topped with delicious vanilla ice cream. The sundae was equally good and came topped with caramel popcorn. Such an amazing idea. 

We left Scales completely satisfied and altogether pleased with the experience. It was a truly amazing meal."
449,"Not impressed overall. 

We know fish. We know good food.

I ordered clam chowder. When it arrived it was not hot. It was so SALTY I had to send it back. I love salt so it was so bad I couldn't eat it. Strike 1

My friend ordered the tuna appetizer and I tried a piece... not fresh. It tasted super fishy. Strike 2

My wife ordered the halibut. Looked good but it was super dry and over cooked. When we complained we were told it was due to the thick cut....?????
We prepare halibut at home all the time-thick/thin in between it doesn't matter. We never have a 
problem. They tried a second time and presented it raw in the middle....really??? Joke. Strike 3.

IF YOU CANT PREPARE A THICK CUT OF HALIBUT  PROPERLY THEN DONT OFFER IT!!!! 

I had the seared scallops that the waiter raved about and said it was the best dish on the menu.
They were ok. Inconsistent sizes of the scallops left the amount they were cooked from raw to over cooked.

Drinks were good and the place was busy. 

Overall I'm sure there are better places to eat in the area. 

Try somewhere else."
450,"The restaurant's appearance is so chic and had great ambience. We didn't make a reservation but we lucked out and was able to get a table. Our waitress was so pleasant and she was very attentive. We ordered a ton of different things to try. Shrimp and corn chowder, steamers, tuna tartare, bluefish pate and some other items I cant remember. But it was all really good. The only thing we didn't like was scallops ceviche which was very salty. The drinks were exactly what we needed after a long day of walking around Portland. Overall it was great and definitely recommend this place. I will be returning."
451,"OMG, best food I've had...maybe ever.  We celebrated our 19th year anniversary while in Portland.  Scallops were absolutely amazing, service very good.  Not a place to go while on a diet as they cook with all the good stuff.  Unfortunately scallops will never measure up in life moving forward.  Have to try them at Scales."
452,"I was there at 4:45 had a glass of wine, sat at the bar and waited until 5:00 for the steamed clams.  I watched them shuck oysters and then take their bare hands and put lettuce on a plate.  Bare hands really. I was mortified, I asked to talk to the manager, he really didn't care. In this day and age who can take a chance.  I would never go back."
453,"Happy hour oysters!! Crab claws!! 

We heard Street & Co was the same owners as Scales and we loved Street & Co so much that we had to stop by Street & Co! 

Come early, like at opening. We came right at opening and managed to snag a bar seat. We got the chowder, oysters, fried whole belly clams, crab claws and lobster bisque. Everything was delicious. The presentation was unique. The claws were so good! 

I wish we were able to eat there for dinner, but it was all booked for the day."
454,"Made our way to Scales, a T&L recommendation, and were not disappointed. We had a blend of the oysters of the day and a couple of appetizers. Everything was fresh and delicious. The Halibut ceviche was my favorite, but the tuna tartare was also excellent. We sat at the bar. Expect to wait to sit even at the bar. There are multiple waiting lists-restaurant, outside and bar. You can sit in bar area but only order off bar menu. However that does include oysters! Sitting at the bar, you get full menu so if you are two, this is the way to go. Only negative was it is a bit loud."
455,"We recently visited Maine and had an incredible time in Portland. If you have not been to Portland, suggest you go as it was rated best food city of the year by Bon Appétit recently. So good in every way! We went to Scales and it was by far, one of the best and most memorable meals I had. One of the best things on the menu is the Grilled Octopus and Chorizo. It was divine. We also had Crab Fritters and Oysters--all excellent.  One cannot go to Maine without eating lobster and that is just what we did. Five of us ordered the lobster and some of us had Fish & Chips. All excellent and fresh beyond belief.  The food is great and the aesthetic is also amazing--wood and windows and old school lighting--cannot beat that it is right on the water as well. Service was fantastic and we left so happy. Worth it in every way if you make it to Maine."
456,"Winter is my favorite time at Scales. Less crowds, $1 oyster happy hour and their winter menu scallops. Recommend sitting at the bar to watch some of the food prep and oyster shucking- they make it look so easy! Oysters, winter scallops, and bread are all must haves here. A bit pricey but worth the splurge. Summer time I would say reservations are needed unless you have some time to wait for a seat at the bar or table in ""the lounge."" 
Additionally, the space itself is beautiful. The windows let in so much daylight and you can see some of the working boats."
457,"It was a tough place to get into on a Saturday night, especially without a reservation. However, the 1.5 hour wait was worth it.

I started with the grilled octopus with chorizo. It had the right balance of salt from the chorizo and a richness from the hazelnuts. The octopus had a great texture, with some moisture still present, but a tasty char.

Next up was the seafood stew. Again it had a good balance of salt, savory, and a hint of spice.

The service was great. I split a bottle of wine with another person who had a different dish from mine. The waiter paired a good Pinot noir that had minimal fruit coming forward, I.e. not a sweet bomb. It was a perfect complement.

Overall, the experience was a really good one. I'm looking forward to another visit."
458,"What's not to like? We tried many small plates and an assortment of fresh local oysters.

Everything was fresh and delicious the server was knowledgeable and friendly, atmosphere trendy bordering on overdone but just falling short of cliché. I mean having fish that you're serving on ice in your entryway is original and I like!

Wish we lived closer!"
459,Great restaurant. We were in town just for the evening and our hotel recommended this restaurant. The food and service were outstanding.
460,"I was part of a large group dining at Scales last week.  We'd been briefed in advance that, even though we had a reservation, our party would not be seated until everyone was present.  Managed to get everyone there on time except for one person; I explained that to the host who could not have been friendlier and seated us right away.  We were seated at a large, comfortable table between the bar and the main dining area.  From there our group could see the water on two sides and the views were stunning. I loved the large windows and airy setting.  Also, Scales is casual but still feels 'upscale' in a fun way (pardon the pun).

Several of us ordered specialty cocktails.  I don't remember the name of the one I had but I do remember it was delicious.  We were assigned two servers, which meant all of our food and drinks got to the table reasonably quickly--very much appreciated. 

I had the clam chowder, the roasted lobster, and the butterscotch sundae with caramel popcorn.  I recommend them all.  After all that food, I could barely walk back to my hotel but it was worth it to taste so much deliciousness.  

Scales is expensive but if you're looking for someplace special with excellent food, service, and ambiance, it's the perfect choice.  I recommend it."
461,The food here was amazing!!! Our first time in Portland and Scales was our first 5 star meal!
462,"Such an amazing spot! The place was warm and inviting even with the open floor concept.  Great views of the harbor and the water. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. There was a great variety of oysters.  I had the hake which had a mouthwatering sauce with hazelnuts.  Potatoes cooked to perfection.  My mom had the pan roasted lobster which she said was perfection.  Definitely recommend for a nice dinner, small or large group!"
463,"Great place all around... really enjoyed our meal and the ambiance!
Nelson"
464,"So good we came twice! The first night we came in for drinks and appetizers. Everything lives up to the expectations. Such flavor. The next night we came back and we ordered the same appetizers as the first night: grilled octopus very tender with amazing flavor, halibut ceviche so of the best ceviche I've had, crab fritters, and then everyone ordered lobster rolls for dinner. The dessert also did not disappoint."
465,"Scales is good. Right down by the water in the old port, depending on where you're seated you may get a view of the dock/boats! I've been here a couple times now. Service is always superb. We had a reservation at 8 and they accidentally only took down that we were a party of 2 when there were 3 of us. They were able to still seat us and we only waited 10 minutes. They came by 4 times to let us know they were getting a table ready for us. We kept it pretty simple and stuck with the smaller dishes. The food was good but I left thinking we could have ate somewhere else. Nothing we got left me thinking ""wow I could eat that everyday"". All that said, I'll be back because my family enjoys this spot when they come to visit."
466,"Everything was very fresh and delicious!! Despite it being a full house, the food was prepared very quickly. Exceptional seafood!"
467,"Great dining experience open kitchen exciting be ready to dine with a hundred noisy diners great cuisine but nothing you could not cook at home I.e. cod poached in butter pricey at $38!!!
$5 in fish market"
468,"Overall, good experience. Disappointed our table was not ready upon arrival, although we did arrive 10 minutes early. Also disappointed there was no coat check. Food was amazing and service was great! Solid recommendations from Charlotte! Great prices, great location, very good service."
469,"Excellent food, relaxed atmosphere, friendly, highly competant staff. Super organized and quick service without pushing us to hurry. Great dining experience overall - and the view adds to the pleasure."
470,"Not impressed. 

We had a large party for a special event. Maybe this is where we went wrong. Anyway...

We arrived and our table wasn't ready. The maître d was super and arranged another table for us. Great! That, for me, was the last thing that went right.

Two dozen oysters arrived shortly after we sat down. We hadn't ordered them. It took 10 minutes to notify the server, during which they sat on our table, and after that we're delivered to the poor folks who actually ordered them. 

My calamari appetizer was very good. 
I ordered an octopus appetizer for dinner because I love octopus. It arrived looking wonderful - two large, nicely cooked tentacles. I took a bite - it was cold. I waited 5-10 minutes to get the servers attention and asked ""should it be cold?"" And it shouldn't so he took it back to the kitchen. No follow up; no suggestion it would be our soon. Nothing. 

Scallops arrived. They were put down in front of my sister and father, but they hadn't ordered them. They sat on the table a couple of minutes, and were then carried to another table- maybe the right table?

10-15 minutes later my octopus returned, or should I say half of it returned. Seriously one tentacle returned. Totally perplexing. Unpleasant. Just bad. 

Go to Street & Co instead. Check out my review. It was excellent."
471,"We made reservations and were seated quickly. Excellent service and food. We tried the clover leaf rolls, baked haddock, greens salad, fried oysters, crab and corn chowder and the blueberry/peach crisp. Totally awesome food!"
472,Went here for my sister's medical school graduation dinner.  The setting is pretty with the water in the background and the interior is nice and comfortable.  The food was excellent.  The lobster roll was fresh and delicious and the scallop entree was amazing.  The service was very nice and professional.  I would definitely recommend.
473,"This restaurant is delicious!! So many dishes to choose, from raw bar to salads to lobster rolls. We had the seared halibut and creamed corn with scallops. And then the buttery dinner rolls..heavenly pillows. 
Definitely set a reservation, which we did not and ended up getting an app and drinks to pass the time. 
Service is attentive and friendly"
474,"So glad we decided on Scales for dinner tonight. The wait was really long so we took our chance and put our name on the list for the bar seating. Nice concept! Sat down right away. Service was incredible. We tried the corn bread, oysters(served right on the bar in a bed of ice!) clam chowder, halibut and the blueberry peach crisp. My only complaint was that I ran out of room to eat more! Everything that we had was first class."
475,Came in here on a chance that it may be good. It was amazing!!! Had the grilled halibut with potatoes. Perfectly seasoned and grilled perfect. Had the apple pear cranberry crisp for dessert. That put me in my happy place. I will come back here if I am in town again
476,"Really liked this open-space, open-kitchen restaurant with excellent food and atmosphere. Loved the entrance door and restaurant location  sort of hidden in an alley, which surprises you once you come into the main restaurant which is so bright and open and with a nice view of the harbor.  Food was excellent, fresh and on point.  Oysters were amazing and so was the pan seared scallops and roasted lobster which I took a bite of my wife's plate."
477,"Been here three times, each time hoping ordering different food items but each time leaving disappointed. I suppose the best bang for your buck here would be the burger. Much better off at some of the other restaurants owned by the same folks (i.e. Fore Street and Street and Co.). 

First of all...who charges for bread anymore?? Scales does. For $4 or so, you can order small bites of very greasy bread (no matter which one you pick...I tried them all). Skip the bread. 

Oysters were fresh and delicious, but nothing special. 

Clam appetizer was FULL of sand. When we ate the first round of clams, the shells were mostly crushed and many were small and dry. We flagged out waiter over after tasting 3 or 4 clams to ask if the dish was supposed to be this crunchy. The waiter was kind enough to replace our dish with another. This time the clams were fatter and juicier...clearly, we got the bottom of the barrel last time. There was also less sand. 

The Scallop entree was good. Scallops were ever so slightly overcooked as the inside flesh started to get a little chewy. Flavor was good and sauce was thick and creamy. 

Cheeseburger - your standard, but juicy burger with a butter bun. French fries were a-ok. Nothing memorable. 

One pro that you can't find in the area is valet parking (for free)."
478,"A plate of oysters, a few littlenecks and some appetizers later and I'd like to go back.

The razor clam appetizer was especially good.  Maybe the cocktails I had made it a bit difficult for me to describe them, but they were cooked well, seasoned well and just all around great.  Octopus was very nice as well.

The cocktails were strong and the service was impeccable.  I'll be back next time I'm in Portland."
479,"Had the mussels app which was really good and the lobster stew which was also very good.  The seafood stew was definitely lacking substance.  Tiny portions of whitefish, squid and clams.  Definitely overpriced for that.  The scallops were really good but kind of small.  Not sure if it was worth the hefty price."
480,"We were in Portland for a long weekend and found it to be a great foodie city! Well, Scales was the capstone of our trip. We saved the best for
last! The lobster roll was the best we had, and we had several. Oysters were so fresh and tasty. The scallops were prepared to perfection. And the craft cocktails, the West End and the Paper Plane, were very well mixed and blended. Our server Sandra was so knowledgeable and helpful. Attentive without being intrusive. Perfection all around!"
481,"This establishment has a valet service that leaves cars idling for the patrons. They could be left idling for hours on end which is terrible for not only the local environment, but also is a massive contribution to climate change."
482,"NOTE: This review is for cocktails and dessert only.

I would never have a reason to come to Scales. The menu is almost entirely meat/seafood products. And well it should be with a name like ""Scales"" and a location *literally* on the water. But I was tipped off that they were serving some of the best dessert in Portland, so... 

The first time we came was late on a Thursday and we asked the host if we could just grab dessert and cocktails, he told us the bar was open for that. ""Could we maybe sit by the windows instead? We're having a date night!"" He didn't seem to like that request much. Dismissively he said, ""the answer is always no if you're not going to eat dinner"" (side note: seriously?!), ""but I'll let you this one time because we're not slammed.""

Not the best first impression, I'll tell you that much.

We were seated by the windows and, despite it being dark out, still got to watch a lobsterman set-up his boat for the next morning. Their location is offering hands-down one of the best views in the whole city. Being out on - and almost at level with - the pier like that is something incredibly special. Try to come here for dusk sometime; it's a breathtaking experience.

We heard the cheesecake was out of this world, and it changes seasonally. We were told that for the holidays/winter it's Spiced Autumn Cheesecake (with cider caramel, harvest granola, and a maple flavored whip cream) for $9.00. A bit steep, but well worth it - it tasted exactly like one would hope it would given the listed flavor profiles. I think this was in the top three cheesecakes I've ever had; well worth the price tag. And, come to find out they make all their desserts in house. Then again, why wouldn't they? The folks who own this place are also the same people behind Standard Baking Company. This alone makes me want to come back to order the cornbread with salted honey butter... I wonder if I would be forced to sit at the bar if I only ordered sides though?

The drinks were also amazing: my partner got the ""West End"" (whiskey, fernet, bitters, and orange) and claims it's one of the best, most balanced drinks he's had in a long time. I got the ""Autumn Sangria Infusion"" (red wine, herbs, spices) and it was good - it wasn't cloyingly sweet or as heavy as I was expecting and as such made for a solid nightcap choice."
483,"We stopped in here on a wintery night, Judd looking for seafood and not expecting much more than that. This restaurant turned out to be absolutely fantastic. The  menu had plenty old standbys, but also some very creative twists on regional seafood. Our waitress Isabella was the best. She was very helpful in narrowing the choices for us and her recommendations were right on the money. 

I had an appetizer of scallop carpaccio with caviar and limes that was superb. The contrasts of the flavors really popped. For entrees, I had the branzino done in a almond butter sauce. I have had branzino many times, but never as good as this. My wife had pan seared scallops with bacon and a sauce that she loved as well."
484,"Fantastic! Beautiful space, right on the ocean and seafood that represents the best that New England has to offer! Starting with the freshly shucked oysters  and clams the selection was varied and the individual examples perfect packets of delicious briny goodness! Plus, the way they serve up these beauties is quite fun too (see photo). We followed that up with a beautiful and tasty plate of the smoked mackerel and the salt cod fritters, both of which offered plenty of crunch, savory  flavors and the right amount of chew to please. Believe it or not we actually followed up all the delights  by ordering entrées. The saffron fish stew for me, a delightfully rich treat filled with a nice variety  of seafood and my wife went with the very nicely done fish and chips! I am so glad we finally tried this wonderful spot! Everything really was so delicious (cocktails too)!"
485,"Huge disappointment!  worst meal in Portland by far.  Our table pretty much ordered the entire menu which was very aggressively priced but the description of the items on the menu sounded very appealing.  Let me preface this by saying I love salt but every item was so salty nobody finish what they ordered and you could not taste any real flavor.   We scooped spoonfuls of salt out of the muscles and made a pile on a side dish,  Yuck!  Our curly blond waitress with lots of tattoos who was originally very friendly ignored us for the rest of the night after alerting her.  After shelling out several hundred dollars and leaving hungry we went across the street for mediocre pizza and a huge drink to counter act the salt which ended up being the highlight of the evening.  We did not see any form of management on the floor or we would have certainly alerted them in hopes of correcting it.  In short, bad service, bad food, acceptable but loud atmosphere, overall not a good value as I have had much better food and service in Portland for far less."
486,"Slick as a salmon, the harbor side seafood emporium deserves it's rep as one of the best in Portland, Maine. It's a long rectangular room that gets full up as quick as the guests fill up on the freshest the sea has to erp up. If they gave you a shovel and a pail instead of utensils, I'd be happy. I'd even be happy going all cave man with no cutlery or plates. So there. 

The decor is ceiling to floor glass so it's like eating in a fish bowl, which is most appropriate given the menu and location next to where the daily catch is off loaded. The menu is not for guppy tummies, either. Sure, you can order dishes by the half but they are still ample for a fisherman's hunger. I suggest you bag the half biz and step/swim up to the task at hand. Wow factor food.    

The place is what Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco could've been instead of the third stop in the air conditioned motor coach (full of oddly dressed tourists) to buy an octopus coffee mug or a ball cap in the shape of a shrimp. 

Scales is a sophisticated yet casual, light, airy and open space. There are lots of tables with elbow room to work that lobster like they was payin' you to eat it. There's a Raw Bar and a Long Bar (at least 100 feet...could be imbibing is the local past time), to enjoy the full bar options. 

Feel free to discount the opinion of Yelpers who only gave 3 stars, dragging the overall average down as one complained at being asked to wait in the bar for 10 minutes. It ain't like a segregation at Gitmo, bisides this place is busy for a reason. Or the one who dissed the joint because he/she/it didn't like sea food. Yo, what was you thinkin? Re-read the name of the place, you enter through a boat door, and the place is drippin' with lures for decor. Go ahead, order the Short Rib Pot Roast but don't roast the place because you don't like fish. You probably wouldn't like Rome either because it has too many old buildings.

The Vibe: Low key. Locals, yocals, and out of towners (and some Yelping downers),

The Bar Program: Lot's of crafty brews, a few ciders for orchard insiders, and an extensive wine list with many by the glass choices. The signature cocktails tend to be on the sweet side So? Just like our server Mikela who was truly sweet, helpful, humorous and enthusiastic. 

The Bug Light was a flute of boozy fruit (which describes half the patrons at the Red Velvet Lounge in OC). Eight Bells Rum, Barrel Aged Maple Syrup, OJ and Brut (as opposed to O.J. the Brute). 

The Fort Sumter was Tanguerey Gin, Muddled Fig, and Fresh Lime served up. Now fully muddled and addled myself, let's eat. 

The Food: This is Sea-forward dining. Duh! Right in the harbor where the fishermen deliver the sea's bounty daily. This is a working restaurant featuring the freshest and best of God's little swimming creatures this side of the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. Nothing here that's been fried even knows it's been fried. No residue, no oil, no puddle of rendered fish fat on your plate, nothing heavy here so order a pile of whatever sings to you. All good. 

Whole Belly Clams. These puppies were flash fried and served with Smoked Jalapeno Aioli and Lemon. Most places don't bother with the bellies (unless you're at a bar in Vegas). Usually you get only strips (also something reminiscent of Vegas). Here, you get the entire clam corpse, fried by an expert. Each belly had a crisp coating form fitting crunch surrounding a briny juicy little treasure. (Yeah, you can find that in Vegas too, but it will cost.)

The Special off menu offering the night I dined there was Diver Scallops. They too were fried, but it just seemed so right, and besides isn't America's favorite flavor crispy? Generally, scallops are too delicate to fry but the line cook manning that station had earned his fins, gills and tail badge and was truly a Fry Master...and I ain't shuckin' you, neither. And it came with a small hill of fries, done just right...my guilty pleasure. 

The Lobster Roll is a local legend as well. Oh, what a sweet fresh lobster! Look close and make sure in ain't still wigglin' in your bun (figuratively speaking). It is nestled in a split top, house baked, butter grilled roll, filled to over flowing with the crustacean that would drive a Rabbi off the Kosher cart. Served simply with Chives and Mayo, oh, I say, oh how wonderful was that little roll in the Bay? 

Dessert: No complaining that your own clam belly is obscuring the view of your shoes. Have the Concord Grape and Apple Pie baked in it's own ramekin with a crust as flaky as the current Presidential Transition Team. 

Scales tip the scales to terrific."
487,"Absolutely delicious, fresh seafood!! The atmosphere encourages good conversation and the décor is simple. I thought it was pretty cool that there's an ice machine dropping crushed ice from the ceiling as well as a huge lobster tank. The Caesar salad was delicious, the Brussels sprouts were a little odd (they're shredded) and the baked stuffed lobster was amazing! I got some sort of cornmeal Brad pudding for dessert, I didn't really dig the flavor or the texture, but the frozen custard was delicious!"
488,"Fresh seafood combined with an ambience that says nice but not stuffy! My fave in Portland. From hotel staff to our Uber driver, to our chartered lobster cruise, everyone recommended Scales. Lobster was amazing and appetizers were tasty as well. The seafood stew was also very good. A memorable experience!"
489,"Amazing seafood! Great service. Our waiter Ben was charming and helpful. We don't have one bad thing to say about this place. If you're in Portland, make your way to Scales and soak in all of its upscale, rustic charm."
490,"If you only have one night in Portland, go here for dinner - it's fantastic! 

Everything from booking the reservation to the service and the quality of the food was amazing. Scales is conveniently located on the water and has a beautiful ambiance. The interior is elegantly decorated but not over the top or stuffy. 

Our waiter could not have been nicer and was super friendly. He recommended our dishes and even gave us breakfast recommendations for the next day. He was spot on with his wine pairing suggestion and gave us the right amount of attention when needed and space to enjoy our meal. 

What we got:

Half dozen oysters: all local, fresh and delicious

Crab and sweet corn soup: great flavor - creamy but still light. Pleasantly warm and a generous portion of crab meat 

Baked stuffed lobster: ""the best lobster I had in Maine"" - Alex; the buttery breadcrumbs were a nice addition to the lobster, but not overpowering to the lobster meat. It came with a small cornbread and slaw

Hazelnut halibut: this dish was so flavorful and different. The brown buttery sauce had a ton of whole hazelnuts and was drizzled over a very large halibut filet. There were a few fingerling potatos added to the dish that were also great

Caramel popcorn and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream: 

Bottle of dry white wine from France

Two cocktails

Total bill: $208"
491,"Remember that Yelp's utility is to locate restaurant options in your locale and not to rely upon the vacuous negative reviews of seemingly entitled yet inexperienced diners. There is no better case in point than with Scales, a new, exciting restaurant on the Maine Wharf trying to achieve in its first year what all fine restaurants offer- my wife and I managed a reservation for the first time last night, though we live a scant three miles out in Casco Bay. From the raw oysters at the bar to the ginger cake dessert this was a wonderful experience- here are some tips for you: don't arrive feeling the world owes you a thing; have a reservation or content yourself with remaining at the bar, sampling appetizers, and promising yourself you will return. Ask your server what's good- they know. Look around you and feel what it is they are doing, from the music to the families to the fresh catches on display- realize the seafood is largely brought in from next door, not even trucked from across town. If you want a red carpet, boot-licking, and deferential bows, go to Manhattan.

6/30/18

Two recent ferry trips across the bay to our favorite restaurant- (how do they ALWAYS seem to find a table for us?) - the scallops carpaccio is a must try- one of you at table should order it, pass it around for each a taste, then ask your server how many scallops are used to make the dish. (!)
Oh, have I told you just how fine the oysters are? That our two granddaughters ate 17 raw oysters between them, and that Vivian, age 7, in response to her mother's ""Vi-vi, slow down and chew your food!"" said , ""Momma, you don't chew oysters!""

10/20/18 great anniversary dinner- wine, oysters, fried clams at the bar, then dinner of fluke special and short rib pot roast. The scene humming with families, happy people."
492,"Went here with my husband on our last night in Maine. We wanted a more upscale, ""date night"" atmosphere (but also seafood), because we mostly ate at hole-in-the-wall places during our trip. Was a long wait without a reservation (understandable) but it was so worth it. The lobster roll and the fish that my husband got were so good. If we're ever in the area again I'd definitely check it out."
493,"Food=fantastic 
Our waitress Sandra= fantastic
Host=not very nice
That's it in a nutshell. Reservation for 6 people. Ridiculous antiquated policy of not seating a party until the entire party is standing in front of the host. Not taking into consideration that the bar was packed, valet parking backed up, so as we waited for our 6th person to walk in the door, (all of 12 minutes) The 5 of us stood in everyone's way instead of being seated at our table, where we could order drinks.... the sassy (man) host would not budge. Come on, if 5 out of ten of your party is there, just seat them! 
On to the positives.  Scallops, fried clams, stuffed lobster, seafood stew, multiple orders of their special breads, clam chowder, crab and corn chowder, multiple sides and fabulous frozen custard desserts. All wonderful. We also sampled wines and specialty cocktails. We were completely happy with our food and cocktails. Our waitress Sandra was knowledgeable and very friendly. 
We spent quite a bit of money this evening, it's not cheap....but we really felt the food was worth it. Now if the owners could just get some friendly accommodating hosts I'll give them 5 stars!"
494,"We had a reservation and didn't want to be late so the others in our party dropped us off to park.   When we walked in Adam the host refused to seat us without the other couple.  When I explained we ate at both their sister companies (foresteeet and street and company earlier this week he said too bad that's their policy.   HOW RUDE!   We waited for them to walk in and the were graced with his attention.  

If not for the other couple I would have walked out the door.   Business must be really good to abuse your clients like this. 

FIRE ADAM.   HE IS NOT HELPING YOU WIN CUTOMERS.    

IT GETS BETTER.  THEY CHARGE FOR BREAD!!!"
495,"We came here on our cross country tour and I was so excited to get authentic Maine food!!! The only thing I wish I listened to with the reviews is the stuffed lobster. It's literally mostly bread crumbs with very little lobster meat. I wish I had just ordered the regular steamed lobster, but I was so enticed by the description of the stuffed lobster I just had to try it. Luckily I wasn't that hungry because it was quite small lobster. It did however allow me to have delicious desserts they offer! Once we come back to Maine we will be back!!"
496,"Came here when Scales had a $1/oyster happy hour deal. So we ordered 40+ oysters and had the best time. If you happen upon a similar deal, just try them all. Many times.

If you can, sit at the oyster bar and marvel at the freshness of the oysters being shucked for you, then neatly presented on a row of ice. 

The awesome and patient bartenders make it an even sweeter deal."
497,"We waited 2 hours for a table but oh goodness was it worth the wait. The place is super fancy hipster, nice big open space where you can see the fresh fish and chefs cooking away. We got the clam chowder and the crab/corn chowder. Both were fine soups. The clam chowder had a lot of clams and oooh boy were they fresh. We also got the mussels--blown away. Definitely the best mussels I have ever had. They should give you a whole loaf of that delicious bread to soak up the sweet godly sauce the mussels are served in. My friend got the seafood stew, it was pretty good though it could have used some hot sauce. I had the steamed lobster which was bannnggiiinnnn. Definitely the best lobster I had the whole time in Maine. So buttery, so fresh, so delicious. If you want a table make a reservation in advance or get ready to wait. Either way it is 100% worth it."
498,"To start with ,we arrived as the restaurant opened to an empty restaurant . When they put us at a table for two in the middle and we asked for a table by the window. They told us those are reserved for parties of three or more. We asked them to make an exception and we stood there for 10 minutes waiting for the answer which was OK. The waitress and the hostess had big time attitude. The lobster bisque was nine dollars for a cup of tasteless cream with small pieces of lobster in the bottom.
The cup of clam chowder was so salty that it was almost inedible. We were told that's the way they make it. We are giving the restaurant two stars because the sauce on our fish entre  was good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. You can eat much better and much cheaper elsewhere."
499,My husband and our friends came here on a recommendation from a man we met going out to check his oyster pots at Cousins.  Truly happy with this man's suggestion.  I even tried raw oysters.  You won't be disappointed and Merrel was an awesome server.  Give them a try.
500,"Phenomenal service. Everyone in our party had allergies. The sous chef Heather came out and worked with us on the menu and she and Chef Josh was easily able to cater to everyone. The restaurant itself is elegant with dim lighting to set a relaxed mood. The staff was amazing. Super friendly and extremely accommodating. Our server Megan was especially friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with the drinks. We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  The bar made me a Cosmopolitan and it was delicious. I had the haddock and it was light and fluffy and the broth was incredibly flavorful. I finished off the meal with a deconstructed cheesecake. It was outstanding. 

I highly recommend this restaurant most especially if you have allergies."
501,"A few weeks ago, a few friends and I decided to meet up at Union for some pre-dinner cocktails. Having never been to Union before, I was excited to experience their venue, as I have walked passed it numerous times.

Upon entering, Union has a modern, American-restaurant aesthetic with wooden floors, modern lighting fixtures and contrasts of black throughout the venue. Union has an expansive bar to sit at with some couch-like bar seating, and a variety of other table seating. On a Saturday night, the bar was definitely popular and busy, which I am assuming is due to Union being in the same building as the Press Hotel. It seemed as though people were coming in to stop for a quick drink before they started making their rounds around the city. 

However, my friends and I opted for the open couch seating by the bar and were quickly greeted by the bar waitress. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and provided AMAZING service. I ordered an extra dirty martini, which was made to perfection, and a couple other friends ordered from the cocktail menu and when they came out, they were presented nicely.

After some time by the bar area, my friends and I figured we might as well stay and try some of Union's dinner options. We were seated in the dining area and again, were quickly greeted by our waitress. Perusing the menu, Union certainly highlights seafood options, which makes sense due to the tourists that stay at the hotel, but they also have a few other protein options beyond seafood. I ended up getting the truffled pot roast, which was served in a small cast iron skillet with vegetables, broth, and some grated horse radish. The flavor profile was amazing and everything was working together nicely. My only negative was that the pot roast was slightly fatty. My friends enjoyed their dishes which included the filet, the scallops, and the salmon.

I ended the night with one of my friends and I sharing the chocolate dolvino, which was a decadent chocolate pudding with pieces of chocolate fudge-like pieces in it. It was incredibly good!

In general, I think Union has a lot to offer. Why not five stars? I think their prices are exponentially inflated for what they are offering. If they brought the price points down on their options, I think they would have even more success, but regardless, I will be sure to be back, even if only for some pre-dinner cocktails and/or dessert."
502,"Very good food, great service and a complimentary dessert that I would marry if it was 1) legal and 2) my husband allowed it.

I've always wanted to come here and when the stars aligned for my birthday and we had a gift card, I knew it was time.

We started out with the cheese plate for $18 which seemed a bit steep for what we got but the cheeses were delicious. I especially liked the cheese.from Fuzzy Udder that looked like brie but wasn't. At the same time, we also got the artisan bread that came with whipped lardo and Casco Bay butter, both a little salty but equally delicious. Did we need all of that? Of course.

For our main dishes, I got the buttermilk fried chicken which came with hen of the wood mushrooms, spoonbread and some dill pickle cauliflower. I am NOT a mushroom person but I decided I was going to try everything. They were delicious and didn't have the slimy texture of most mushrooms. My chicken was very crispy and had a sweetness to it that I really liked. My husband got the sea scallops that came with a succotash and crispy pork shoulder. He cleaned his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed it.

Finally we got dessert because it was my birthday after all! The chocolate budino sounded amazing so we ordered that. Its a rich chocolate mousse with a chocolate torte and some cream. I could have licked the bowl when we we're finished. It was probably the best thing we had all evening. Even better, it came out with a lit candle and they gave it to us for free!

The last thing I'll mention is the service. It was wonderful. Our waiter was attentive without hovering and was knowledgeable about the food. He was really great and wished me a happy birthday a few times. I really recommend visiting Union."
503,"Great spot inside the Press Hotel. Not too crowded at lunchtime. Started with the brussels sprouts, which were awesome, and the clam dip which came spread out on a plate with a pile of thin twisted fritter and chive powder - wow! The frisee salad was pretty standard but good and the white bean soup had a nice flavor to it but had lamb in it that sunk to the bottom. I would have preferred it without the lamb. We were sadly too full for dessert but would for sure like to come back for dinner and a treat another time."
504,"Food tasted good, but the portion sizes were very small for their steep prices (thank goodness for that bread and butter that comes with dinner). 

Our octopus was cooked well and we enjoyed our drinks, but it's one of those restaurants where they focus on the plate decor instead of the quality/ quantity of the food. Pretty, but not enough."
505,"My extended family surprised me with a 50th birthday party here the other night.  For whatever reason, this restaurant has never been on my radar but I was very impressed nevertheless. Obviously, I was not part of the planning, but my sister said the restaurant and the event planner were very helpful and good to work with. As the recipient of the festivities, here are my impressions.

Our waitress was excellent.  I made a deliberate effort to  remember her name so I could publicly acknowledge her, but alas, a martini and a good bit of Cabernet Sauvignon ruined that.  Nevertheless she was a perfect blend of attentive and timely.  She always seemed to be there when you needed her but was not intrusive or overbearing.

The food overall was excellent however the complimentary bread was quite boring.  Nevertheless, things improved quickly from there.  I had the veal carpaccio which was plated beautifully and was a wonderful contrast of textures.  Veal might be a touch too bland for the dish, but it still was a pleasant experience.  I chose the truffled pot roast for my entree.  Some members of my family expressed their surprise that I did not pick something ""fancier"" but I had a good feeling about this.  I was definitely right..... beautifully tender meat and a truffled jus that was fantastic!  

Everyone I talked to in our party enjoyed their meals.  Even my finicky daughter loved her chicken dish and even tried the mushrooms that they were sautéed with.

The best of the meal was that my father picked up the tab for the whole meal, which judging by his facial expression was painful."
506,"Very nice dinner at Union! A friend recommended Union, so we were looking forward to it!
Hip place, nice menu!  Kim had the Bolognese, I had the cod, both very good! Excellent service!"
507,"Lunch here is sunny with great service and tasty noms. 

On a lark, I went here on a business lunch and it's the perfect venue for such an outing. I could see it being a cosy place for two friends sharing a lunch break also. During the day, it does not strike me as romantic but at night, it could be. 

We ordered the truffle oil potato chips with ranch dip for an appetizer and they. are. rich. Do not order these for ""something light.""  They are incredible and tasty; excellent balance of salt and creamy if you use that homemade ranch dipping sauce. A table of four will polish them off, but for two people, it's a challenge. 

For lunch, I got the burger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, cheese, and ""Union sauce.""  It was a great burger, moist and fresh and cooked well. The English muffin as the bun was the let down. It took away from what could have been an outstanding burger! It was dry and flavorless. Give us a pretzel bun or Kaiser roll or just a sesame hamburger bun and it'll make all the difference. The Union sauce was unknown but it complimented the meats/cheese/veggies well. 

It comes with a salad (which after the chips I should have gotten) or fries. I opted for the fries and THEY ARE FRENCH FRIED FINGERLING POTATOES!! Cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly, I was so happy to have gotten them--despite my fried food overload. 

I ordered coffee too. It's good. Have no idea if it's Sanka or Tandem or CBD or what, but a good cup of joe is a good cup of joe, ifyouknowhatImean. 

Our server was delightful. I'd give her a shout out but I can't remember her name. Very attentive-never let our water deplete! A+++ for that. 

That English muffin bun fiasco is the only thing from giving Union a fourth star. I'll be back though as there were plenty of things I wanted to try on the menu."
508,"Came to Union for brunch while in Portland, Maine and loved it!! The restaurant was beautifully decorated and very modern. 

We ordered the eggs Benedict and the cornbeef hash and the cleansing juice, and all the items we got were amazing!!! The juice was fantastic and so unique, I would highly recommend it. It was very flavorful and gingery. 

Overall a great restaurant in downtown Portland, in a great location, with a very delicious brunch menu!"
509,"Huge foodie and was super excited to try this place. But I left disappointed. 

Started off with the ""local favorites"" seared tuna. $18 for 4 pieces of seared tuna with not enough sauce and too much garlic oil on the slaw. Too many competing and contrasting flavors, dish didn't know what it wanted to be. Skip. 

Then had the braised lobster with corn fritters and Summer corn chowder. I basically chose this restaurant for this dish, because these are three of my favorite things to eat! Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Lobster was cooked perfectly, but the corn fritters were extremely salty and dry. Also no corn kernels to be found! I've found that the best corn fritters often have actual pieces of corn in them. Dish left more to be desired. 

Boyfriend had the crab pasta, which was the best dish we tried. Wish I had ordered that instead. But it came with mint on top, which was very unsettling. 

Ended with the deconstructed whipped cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, would highly recommend! 

Decor is beautiful, service nothing to write home about. There have to be better restaurants in Portland."
510,The food is fresh and delicious. The portions are generous. The service is impeccable. Must visit if you are in Portland
511,"Fantastic birthday meal here. Service was stellar. We started with two dry ciders, very good. Shared an appetizer, the poached duck egg. Executed to perfection. Smoky and buttery and decadent. For dinner, the sirloin was soft and succulent, great use of Hen of the Woods mushrooms. Flavor was on point. Other dish, the Hake was fantastic too. Great baby clams, perfectly cooked bok-choy, house made Chinese sausage, kim-chi. Just a great flavor combo. Lots of Umami in the broth the fish sat upon. Only disappointment was the gelato sold as salted caramel but tasted more like butterscotch. A small difference and didn't change the fact that this restaurant's food quality and cost were great. Definitely recommend and would return for sure."
512,"Nestled on the first floor of the Press Marriott Hotel, this very pricey restaurant has unusual and tasty dishes.
The Lobster Bisque loaded with mostly potatoes, vegetables and crackers is worth a try. I would have preferred more Lobster in it. The Liver Pate Appetizer was interesting but not spectacular.
We ordered two Chef Signature dishes. One the Cod Dish and the other Pot Roast. According to my husband the chef,  the Pit Roast couldn't have been prepared better!
The Cod dish was interesting and the clams and nik Chou were delicious. 
The desserts are quite unique as well. I would recommend the Apple Brûlée which was light and delicious! Top that off with a capuchin o! Yum!"
513,Went to celebrate my aunt's birthday it was everything she expected. The service was amazing from the waitress to the valet parking. Food was deliouse. As a starter we got the Burratta absolutely amazing! I got the slow cooked lamb shoulder and my aunt the salmon. Not a huge sweet person but thr dessert was sooo good
514,"Definitely one of Portland's Finest and now jumping up my top 5 in the city for good, reliable COMFORT FOOD... from pot toast to their amazing fresh pasta with bolognese sauce... trust me... it's like none other. 
Our waiter, Randy explained how the pasta is made with little 'nooks' in it ... I think we would think it's 'irregular' but the chef has this thing about keeping the sauce sticking to the pasta while you gain full flavor... MASTERED! 
There is a very unique texture to this dish and trust me, you'll go back for more or you'll try hard to make not so perfect pasta for this very reason. 

Appetizers are creative (shrimp and hominy) will be a great start or try the brussels... in s category completely of their own. Huge Brussels sprouts fan here so I love to see what a chef can do with them... these guys nailed it.

Union has climbed my ranks of awesomeness and with the food scene getting better by the day in Portland, this is one you won't want to miss. 

Cheers! Thanks guys! Great Grub!"
515,"I absolutely love this place. I go just about every other week for brunch and everything is amazing. My favorite is the huevos rancheros, because of all the different flavors included in one dish. I also love the muffins and bacon. This is a very nice restaurant with lots of details. 10/10 would recommend going to this place."
516,"Trying to diet in this city is very difficult! The good in Portland is so good but not always health conscious. I've been coming to Union for breakfast on weekends because I can get a very good dish of eggs, with wheat toast and turkey sausage that is very dry and not dripping with grease.

Today, our server Bridget even offered to replace the potatoes with berries for me. Her demeanor the entire meal was absolutely delightful. It's always good here but today was really exceptional."
517,"Came here for a Sunday brunch and we were immediately seated. We ordered the corned beef hash, crab pasta and the seafood chowder. The pasta was quite good with plentiful crab meat pieces. The corned beef hash was okay and nothing really stood out. The biggest disappointment was the seafood chowder. For $14, I expected a bit more. But what we got was a bowl of mainly fish pieces, ginger and some potato. There was literally no chowder or broth. The bowl was small too but even then it didn't taste appetizing to finish. Overall, the environment and decor seems nice but for the price maybe go elsewhere for brunch."
518,"Absolutely fantastic! Such a great addition to the Old Port. We popped in late Saturday and were able to be seated within just ten minutes even though we didn't have a reservation. I had probably one of the best old fashioneds ever, perfectly balanced and sweet. The crab pasta I had for dinner was absolutely amazing. So pretty and tasted beyond what I thought a pasta could taste like. My companion really enjoyed his swordfish special and said it was the best he had ever had. 

Two things that keep this from being a five star review: The first is that the dessert I had was honestly ""meh"". I had the Union M&M's standing for macarons, madeleines, and meringues. While generous in amount (two of each dessert), each item tasted like it was store-bought and not all that unique. The madeleines were very dry and had no taste to them, while the macarons were hard and crunchy instead of light and airy. Definitely wouldn't order this again. 

The second is that a few days after the dinner went through on my credit card, I noticed that the total of my bill was slightly higher than what I wrote down on my slip. It was just a few dollars more, so nothing that's going to wipe me out, but it does seem a bit dishonest that the server would think its okay to add more money to her tip, when I didn't write that amount down. Maybe pay in cash next time to avoid being swindled. 


I definitely will be back to enjoy the food! But ask to make sure the desserts are fresh and make sure your tip is what you left!"
519,"On my recent visit to Portland, I chose this restaurant based on reviews on Open Table when looking for a place to dine. It also was located in our hotel, the Press Hotel.  The restaurant itself has a contemporary feel. There's a dining area and a bar area. I was underwhelmed by the service received at this restaurant.  The young gentleman serving us seem like we were a bother.  As a waitress in my younger years, I notice good service and I expect a server to approach the table and introduce himself. That did not happen.  I was very surprised as we received nothing but special and courteous treatment from the staff members of the hotel. My husband and I started with a couple cocktails from the bar and ordered two of the appetizers. The seared goat cheese and the roasted carrots, both were delicious.  I was, however, disappointed that the carrots only had six colorful petite carrots on the plate.  I ordered the scallops for my dinner and my husband had the special fish of the night. He enjoyed his entrée. I loved the fennel that was served with my three scallops. They were perfectly grilled and tender. Again, the food was good but the service was lacking. I had no refill on my water until after I was finished with my meal.  I expect more from a restaurant that charges these prices. I expect to be waited on by a friendly and attentive staff member who introduces themselves, which did not happen. For my last night in Portland, I wanted this to be a special meal and that is why I chose Union.  The dinner we had at David's restaurant in Portland was so much better as we were treated wonderfully and waited on attentively. I think Union could learn a thing or two from David's management on how to train service staff.  It really does make a difference for the all-around experience while dining."
520,"I HIGHLY reccomend the chef's table at Union for a special occasion...such a delightful and delicious experience! We just did the 5 course chef's tasting menu for my birthday. The chef (actually sous chef, Bri) lead us through a personalized menu (no meat for me/no dairy for my man). The food was outstanding...creative, thoughtful and local. The whole kitchen team was spot on. Thanks a million for making my birthday so special!"
521,"Made a reservation for 11am brunch. Arrived a few minutes early. Waited 10 minutes, had three different hostesses talk to us before we were finally seated (and there were multiple tables open). They all seemed incredibly confused. Ordered granola and milk, as listed on the menu. The granola arrived with no milk and no spoon. Had to ask for milk and then was charged extra for it. Server removed the charge but indicated we were wrong even though granola and milk was an ITEM ON THE MENU. I give up! Food good but won't be back."
522,"I truly want to love this place.

I just can't seem to make it work, though.

If I was from out of state and was coming to Portland, there's a good chance this is one of the hotels I would end up at. And, who knows, maybe I would check out Union for breakfast (which I *still* hear is amazing years later, and am *still* going to try one of these days) or a cocktail and love it. But... as a local who knows some of the great locations throughout the city for food, drink, and service, this place continues to underwhelm me. Despite the many times I've now been here, I always leave wishing I had chosen a different bar. 

+/- Cocktails 
During the winter they've got this fig and walnut concoction that might be one of the best in the city; unfortunately, they're pretty strict about only making what's on their current menu. Recently I had a $14 cocktail that was 2/3 full and tasted of watered-down lime juice (it was even greenish in color). Frustrating since I bought something that was supposed to be bourbon, apple brandy, and cinnamon simple syrup. My friend's cocktail tasted like a warm melted chapstick. They both were bad enough that after one sip I asked her if she wanted to go to a different bar. I would have liked to talk to the bartender about our drinks, but... 

- Service
At my latest experience, the bartender wasn't personable or attentive at all. At least not to us. We ordered two rounds of drinks, and both times they seemed to come out staggered (we're talking twenty or so minutes between her drink and mine arriving). Beyond that, he wouldn't look at us when taking or delivering our orders - he was fixated on a large group of business men just behind us. Weird thing to note, I know, but it's weirder to be ""talking"" to someone who's looking past your shoulder at other people. And when explaining our drinks and food, he literally walked away mid-sentence (multiple times) to take care of someone else. So... not feeling especially wanted here.

- Food
I still can't wrap my brain around that cheese plate being almost $20. Yes, it's definitely more ample and balanced then it was when they first opened, but I've had cheese plates at nearly every place in town, and have had just as good or better for far cheaper and more plentiful. It's definitely not worth the price tag.

I'm so sorry, Union. I just don't get it. I don't know if it's me. If it's you. If it's me plus you. I will absolutely give it another go, though, because I'm determined to make us work... but first, I just need to get the taste of this lime drink out my mouth."
523,"Visiting Portland for a few days, we wanted to end the trip with a nice sit down dinner. Based on the reviews on here, we easily picked Union to eat at.
Coming from New Jersey, we are used to heavily packed restaurants around dinner time. But there was no wait at 6pm. There were a good amount of people at the bar and a few tables filled. 
The food is amazing. The house made bread was great. I'm a huge fan of the free bread anywhere. We had the crab pasta as an appetizer, and that did not disappoint at all. My friend and I both ordered the salmon dish and were nothing but pleased. It was delicious. We didn't talk the entire time because of how good it was. Well portioned. Cooked well. The flavors were balanced well. As my friend put it ""exquisite."" I don't want to call it perfect, because what do I know about food, but it was very good.
We felt that we were underdressed and there was no fuss about it. The service was phenomenal. Monica, our waitress, was beyond pleasant and absolutely wonderful to have. 
Portland is a wonderful area and we will be back for sure in the future with friends and we will make sure to stop by union to eat again!!"
524,"I'd actually give this a 3-point-something. It was better than OK, but nothing great either.  I'm not sure what exactly seemed to bother me about this place, but it felt like they didn't live up to their expectations. 

For one, it's restaurant week, and they are listed on the Maine Restaurant Week website. When they called to confirm the reservation, and restaurant week was inquired about, the man on the phone said it was the ""chef's surprise."" Oh? Maybe I'll surprise the chef with anaphylactic shock in return. Ok, well, no big deal; one can always ask more questions upon arrival. 

Upon arrival, the table wasn't ready. Fortunately, I am always happy to drink my night away, so I asked for my numbing-concoction-of-choice: Maker's on the rocks. Had I not spewed out that decision at the speed of lightning as I always do, the bartender didn't come back around for a while. Granted, he was busy, just not very personable. Maybe I wasn't there with the right person to enjoy myself. There were couples to my left and right who seemed to be sexually active with one another, so I guess I should just be happy for them. 

When the table was ready, we closed out and moved.  Our waitress was really friendly. She didn't mention restaurant week, but I asked for menu items, and she did deliver. I thought they paled in comparison to all other local restaurant-week menus because there was only one (as opposed to three) options. I think they are a little misleading to say they partake in restaurant week, but then once you arrive it's ""we always have a tasting menu available.""

The cheese plate was eh. I tried the three cheeses and only didn't want to barf on one of them.   One was cheddar-like and the others were very potent varieties, which aren't my taste. The parsnip soup I didn't partake in. The brussel sprouts were great, and my favorite part of the night. Meal: I had the pork shank. It was fine. It was luke warm and under salted, and I could never quite get my waitress' attention, so I gave up and ordered another drink. Other dish: Scallops. They were good, and quite oppositely salted compared to my dish.  Had to say no to dessert, so I can't judge that category. 

Meh."
525,Went for brunch on a Saturday and was quite impressed. French toast was one of the best I've had and the Brussels sprouts appetizer was tasty and original. Overall definitely one of the better brunch/breakfasts I've had recently. Would return to try lunch/dinner in the future.
526,"We tried to get into Eventide Oyster Co., but were seated outside with the narrow tables - didn't think we could eat comfortably with 3 people!

So, we ubered over Union as our Plan B.  It is so beautiful inside -  clean and refined.  My friend and I ordered the seared tuna app  and the salmon curry!  So so so delicious!  My other friend ordered the lobster roll and the avocado toast.  Both were to die for!

The best part of the meal was our waiter and bartender Isaac!  Our conversations with him was like our dessert.  He recommended a ton of places we plan on patronizing the next time we are in town.  He was the Alexa of Yelp.  

We will definitely be back at the Union!"
527,"Visiting from San Francisco. It's hard to top good food with where we hail from. Hanger steak was excellent, Hake amended for me as a gluten-free option was out of this world (spicy and exceptional sauce that I used my spoon with)...chocolate Budino and deconstructed cheese cake was excellent. Love the atmosphere of bustling lobby couches and a great bar with dinner tables interspersed."
528,"Had breakfast.  There were 6 of us, sat at the high top by the window. Service was very good.  They were able to accommodate gluten free diets. We had the avocado toast, omelettes, lighter fare egg whites.  Food came quickly and was delicious."
529,Red flannel hash was delicious! Corned beef and beets was a nice combo and I might have to make this at home soon. Good coffee. Nice space in downtown Portland. Service was friendly. Kinda pricey but the food was very good.
530,"Delightful! 
GLUTEN FREE accommodations were excellent and we will return. 
We were searching for a place that was new to both of us for Maine Restaurant Week. We opted for Union at The Press Hotel and are so glad we did! 
We both chose to do the ""surprise"" 3 course MRW option. The cocktail I ordered was very well made and exactly as I'd asked for; it WAS pricey at $14, but delicious.
The staff was incredibly accommodating and polite, knowledgable and answering my questions sufficently."
531,"Solid breakfast. I love their hash with fingerling potatoes and beets. Topped with two perfectly poached eggs. Coffee by design coffee. 
We started with cantaloupe served over cottage cheese. Sprinkled with grape nuts and pistachios. Yum. 
My only hang up is that the bloody Mary's are served in a tall skinny glass. Hardly anything there and very pricy."
532,"Located in a swanky hotel, Union is a rather formal dining room in a otherwise fairly casual Portland food scene. 

And so it comes as no surprise that service was impeccable. Our waitperson was very efficient, accommodating and knowledgeable.

5 star for service.

What was less than stellar was the food. Given the high star rating and beautiful interior, i was expecting similarly amazing food.

The best things?
- zucchini crab cakes -phenomenal, fresh and not at all oily
- salad - ask delicious and fresh
- burrata - super creamy with a little jolt of weirdness with the presence of raisin like fruit
- salmon - very fresh and well seared 

Okay, not great
- corn with potatoes - this didn't work for me. The corn was light and fresh but the potatoes tasted starchy and mushy and so than texture didn't complement the crisp corn
- pot roast - disappointing; lacked flavor and salt. The root vegetables were bland
- cookies -these ""house made"" cookies tasted like cheap store bought pecan sundies and chips ahoy and Costco madeleines.
- house bread - this is obviously very rustic but was a little too hearty. Felt like I was eating super high fiber spelt bread
- tofu pesto risotto - okay, probably my fault for ordering such a dish but I wanted to try something different. This was a fail - why tofu at all? Wrong texture. Pesto was made from arugula which made it unbearably bitter without the fragrance of basil.

So the 4 rating reflects superior service(5) and solid tho not spectacular (3) food"
533,"We had drinks and apps at Ink Well, the bar at Union/ The Press Hotel. It was a little disappointing that after 7 of us were sitting in the lounge foe 20 minutes, I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender is someone could serve us drinks and if we could order food.... the response was ""of course we can serve you, we were waiting for someone to let us know you were ready""...... 
well... the apps were wonderful, drinks good.... I just feel at what is one on the most high end hotels in Portland ......you should not have to go to the bar and asked to be served...."
534,Beautiful inside. Fantastic offerings. Food was amazing . Gluten free options available
535,"Woooow such a treat to enjoy a meal here at Union! While I usually stay away from hotel restaurants (they tend to be over hyped with less exciting menus) I loved Union. Every bite was delicious and perfectly balanced and I wish I lived closer to Portland so I could come back here. 

The braised lobster featured a velvety cream broth that somehow made the lobster taste even more lobstery! This was one of my most favorite meals in Portland, hands down."
536,"We went to Union for brunch on a Sunday. There was no wait. It's inside a hotel which we didn't realize until we got there. Good food, nice space and good service. We got avocado toast with bacon and a benedict. Both were pretty good. Coffee wasn't the best around. The thing that threw me off was the price. I think it was overpriced. Food was good but not worth the price."
537,"Stopped in to try the new appetizer and drink special menu...and wow! A crab roll (as in not lobster, and totally fabulous), sliders, charred octopus, sangria, beer. Delicious, affordable and such a great spot to perch and watch, by great staff. 
I can't wait to go back."
538,"Located in the Press Hotel, this was one of the best breakfasts I've had.  Everything is fresh and perfectly cooked with just the right seasoning.  The maple sausage is amazing, and you have to try the homemade jams."
539,"Terrific meal, great staff, nice menu including cocktails and mocktails, and beautiful spot. We brought some cupcakes to do a mini gender reveal, just the two of us, and they were super gracious with plates and even some complimentary cookies to enjoy along side. A perfect place to celebrate our upcoming boy!"
540,Super good breakfast place. English muffin and blueberry muffins were amazing. Waitress could've been friendlier but maybe she was having a bad day.
541,"Popped in here for a snack and drink. The atmosphere was great- bar is kind of small but it's cozy and there are seats at the bar, couches and assorted table seating.

There wasn't much in the way of cocktails on the menu but they seem to have a decent variety of liquor. We just stuck to beer tonight and the selection was good.

For the snack we ordered the chicken liver pate. I'm not a huge liver lover- I've had amazing liver toasts in Italy and had horrible experiences elsewhere so it was a toss up but it was the best thing out of the options given we had plans to get cheese and charcuterie elsewhere later tonight. The chicken liver pate came out on a thick piece of grilled bread that was cut into thirds and had a side of mushrooms and a runny egg. The pate was chilled but with the warm bread, egg and mushrooms it was perfect. Even my boyfriend who is completely anti liver couldn't help trying it and was pleasantly surprised.

Great experience. The entrees on the menu look pricey for Portland but judging by what we saw come out- we'd definitely come back to try this for dinner next time."
542,Good food - uneven service. Had there burger and it very good. Served on a muffin. Had the homemade chips as well - they were great. Water was slow to he refilled. One server kind of hovered to take the plates as soon as you were done. Not necessary.
543,"Oh where do I start... I have wanted to come here ever since they opened. I met a friend here for drinks and an appetizer after work on a Wednesday. I ordered a drink that I honestly can't remember what it was called, but it was made with rhubarb and something else and it was hot. The description sounded delicious the product was anything but... it tasted like melted crayons. My friend ordered a lime flavored drink, the Old Orchard I believe. It literally tasted like watery lime juice. Our drinks didn't even come at the same time, it was very odd service. Our bartender really seemed extremely disinterested in us. No eye contact, no smile, no friendly bartender banter... nothing. 
My second drink, a Dark and Stormy, was good, but it's hard to mess that up. My friends 2nd drink was an extra dirty martini  she said it was just eh. 
The $18 cheese plate was delicious, but not even close to worth the price. 
I think that next time I'll try the Inkwell instead."
544,"My family stopped in for brunch yesterday. There was enough variety on the menu for everyone to find something they loved, including the kids. Lovely atmosphere, great service and delicious food! I loved it."
545,First time in Portland and this place was recommended by a bartender at Bull Feeney's. I am so glad we listened. The eggs benny with lobster was to die for. Delicious brunch cocktails also.
546,"The three stars goes to the awesome bartender since the food was mediocre at best. I had the thanksgiving 3-course meal. $55 to get tendons that were as hard as fish bones in my turkey. What if those tendons got stuck in my throat? My server/bartender was very attentive and quickly asked the kitchen to explain. The host was pretty awful, too. She would constantly stare into something behind me instead of making eye contacts while talking to me. Girl did you see a ghost behind me? This is place is certainly overrated. Not a fan."
547,"Stopped in late last night for a drink and dessert. I was very impressed with the decor and ambience. I'm a fan of the solid marble bar top. Wish there was a foot rest under the bar, but no biggie.
Wine list was very well composed. Service was great. Dessert was very well executed. The description on the menu seemed vague compared to the complex, but playful dish we were served. I will definitely be back for an actual meal."
548,"Can't say enough good things about their delicious food! Their use of fresh, high quality ingredients was very evident, every bite was incredible! Would highly recommend if you're looking for high-end quality but completely unpretentious and prices are very reasonable for the quality."
549,This restaurant is just ok. I had the simple breakfast and they put most of the fruit in the mustard. The cheese wasn't very fresh. The ham was pretty good and so was the croissant. Those were the only things that were good.
550,I'm not usually a fan of restaurants in hotels.  This place was different.  So good.  Would recommend the swordfish.
551,"We loved this restaurant which is located in the Press Hotel in downtown Portland Maine.  It is a lively place, but still quiet enough to enjoy a conversation.  We were there on a Sunday night, so Friday and Saturday nights may have a higher noise volume.

Three of our group started with the Maine Crab pasta as an appetizer.  It is a fairly rich dish and if you order it, you may not want to get a large entree.

For my entree, I ordered the Mountain Trout, and I was not disappointed.  The trout was cooked perfectly and was served with new potatoes, porcini mushroom & asparagus cream sauce.

Another in our party ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and I was told that it was delightful.

Our group's desserts included the Chocolate Budino and Blueberry Sorbet.
Both dishes were big hits."
552,"Great option if you are staying at the Press hotel. Here's the rundown:

Scallops - A
Brussels - A +
Arugula salad A- 
Erik was great at the bar
Misses - the soup, dessert 

Had breakfast here the next morning and was impressed."
553,"This place has been on my list for a while so I finally went with some friends for an after work cocktail. I was deciding between The Riot and The Down East. I explained my dilemma to the bartender and he asked me whether I wanted to go ""tart"" or ""effervescent."" I went for the latter and ended up the tasty and refreshingly light Down East cocktail. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts with chimichurri and cheese curds. I love Brussels sprouts and these did not disappoint!! 

I would like to visit Union again for some more drinks and food. I love the clean lines of the space and the overall vibe of the place. Definitely will go back!!"
554,"Visited Portland for the weekend and Union was the highlight! The cocktails were out of control amazing, I had the garden party which was extremely refreshing as well as the small sword which was spicy but not overwhelming. The brussel sprouts were unlike anything I have ever had before, charred to PERFECTION! I could have stopped there and would have been fully satisfied but then came the main course. I cannot put into words the way the Maine crab pasta made me feel, but I think I died and went to heaven for about fifteen minutes. I go out to eat a lot, but have never written a review on yelp before; I'm making an exception for Union because this experience was exceptional! Shout out to our lovely server Maria. She was very nice and gave great recommendations. This place is a little on the expensive side but totally worth it"
555,"Had a very nice dinner here Saturday, and the service was really excellent, but the flavors in my main course were a little disappointing, especially given rave reviews. I made the reservation a week prior, and I did it over the phone, because the times I wanted weren't available online, and I was so impressed when they asked about any allergies (I have a dairy allergy). It would have been cool if the server had this info when we sat down, but he knew how to help me when I brought it up after we sat down. The hostess too went out of her way to help find some bread I could have to dip in olive oil while the others at our table snacked on their regular bread and butter. I was really intrigued by the homemade venison sausages on the menu, so two of us split that to start, and the other two enjoyed the squash salad. My wine was very expensive at $16 a glass, but it was also one of the best ones I've ever had. For the main course I went with the scallops and clams with pasta and leeks, which I found somewhat disappointing. I would have liked more seasoning for the broth, like thyme, to lighten and freshen up the flavor. 

This place came highly recommended from two contacts from back home in Portland, so I might like to give this place a second try next time I visit."
556,"great food, we went for breakfast because we were staying in the hotel upstairs and it was included with our room. i'm more of a greasy diner kind of gal so this was a little fancy for my taste, but delicious nonetheless!"
557,"Only ordered drinks and an appetizer.. The drinks were slightly above average, but the charcuterie plate was not worth the price."
558,"What a gem in Portland! Got lucky driving around Old Port and saw this place and there was a parking spot outside. glad we decided to go in!

I had the Smoked Salmon tartine (SO GOOD) and my boyfriend got avocado toast, which he added lobster to. We couldn't decide which was better. & the roasted potato side, YUM!

My favorite part was the bloody mary, which was perfectly seasoned and came with everything seasoning spice on the rim. It wasn't  on the brunch menu - so glad i asked if they did brunch cocktails because it was fantastic. 

Highly recommend."
559,"Delicious food, great service, warm and relaxing ambiance.  We arrived a half hour early for our dinner reservation but were seated immediately, and served an impressive array of savory dishes.  My dining companion is a vegetarian and I am a pesca-vegetarian, and we were both keeping Passover (gluten free) on top of this - so it's not an easy feat to serve a satisfying dinner with these restrictions!  But Union pulled it off with ease.  I haven't eaten this well for months."
560,"Very surprised and delighted by my meal at Union last night. The 5 star rating is because this is one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. I'm not keen on most restaurants is inside hotels so I was a little ok I started looking for a different place to eat, so I was very skeptical.

I stayed because of the Yelp reviews. I sat in the bar area, a bit cold with the door continually opening and closing. They have a chefs table I could have moved to but I felt bad knowing the tip for the meal would go to someone other than the nice staff who had been serving me.

I ordered the Salmon with beets and horseradish, fingerling roasted Maine potatoes and the bok choy. Honestly didn't know how the salmon, beets and horseradish would work together but it was amazing!! The serving size was huge, happily took home left overs and will enjoy them again. The perks of being out of town working for the weekend.

Happy I ventured out in the rain and decided to stay. If your unsure, you should definitely take the time and try it. I was pleasantly surprised, even sent a thank you to the chef."
561,"I had brunch at Union on a Sunday afternoon and was very surprised by how empty it was. Considering the accolades it has received I figured it would have more than 3 tables occupied.

I was seated by the friendly host and provided with three menus...two of which were for alcohol. I was surprised to see that the only menu available at 1:45pm on a Sunday was the Brunch menu, I always thought of Brunch as being earlier in the day, but I was thankful I had eaten a hearty breakfast of an ""Andrew's Behemoth"" at Fernald's Country Store in Damariscotta two hours before, on my trip from the Lincoln County down in to Portland. 

At Union i ordered the Baby Arugula salad which had a delicate flavor and texture, save for the green tomatoes which were a bit too green and hard for my liking. The charred corn, and other parts of the salad were fantastic though and I would order it again.

I followed this up with the Spanish Tortilla which is essentially an omelette. I subbed chicken for the chorizo as I'm not a fan of pro and found the omelette to be acceptable. I'm not a big omelette fan but it was the only thing that I could get on the menu which is incredibly small - Duckfat has more options. The wheat toast that came with the egg dish however was quite good and there sure was no shortage of mix ins within the omelette which made for a hearty dish. 

I was really looking forward to one of their sandwiches and was very disappointed to not see any of the menu during my trip. Throughout the 45 minutes I was  there I was looked after quite well by a very competent wait staff, among the best I've experienced in Maine. I'm looking forward to giving Union another try in the future but I doubt I'll revisit for Brunch due to the very limited selection."
562,"We had another wonderful meal at Union.   While their preparations aren't without issue or calamity all the time, their promptness to take care of issues and the speed with which they react makes this a 4/5 star experience.    This was our fourth time here.    Last time, I had an entre issue and it was fixed and removed from the bill.   This time, the pork chop was, unfortunately, not cooked at all at the bone.   It had been removed too quickly from the grill, and I found in the last bite it still wasn't cooked sufficiently.    They removed the charge for the entre and I got an extra few swallows of wine in my glass to make amends.    We will come back, unquestionably."
563,This has to be one of the best restaurants in town. The chef... Scott...is great. He's open and friendly and willing to do anything to please your palate! Staff is so friendly and professional. Special cudos to Bridget and Martin for their exquisite advice and conversation. Love this place...I highly recommend it!!
564,"Pretty solid cocktail bar, with yummy oysters! Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to try other meals, but definitely worth going back and trying more. And in Portland, that statement means a lot, what with so many delicious places to become regulars!"
565,"We ate brunch there yesterday, and cannot think of any other word to say other than ""stupedous"".  The ambience, the food, the drinks, the server that we had.....all above the top.  And for the quality of everything, reasonably priced compared to the city in which we live.

The food:::::::so fresh, so creative presented and put together, the ingredients, so imagination of putting certain ingredients together.....fabulous.

The drink:::::::whoever comes up with the drink, a thank you for putting the time and imagination in them.  Never ever had a bloody mary so good!!!!!

The server:::::polite, informative, attentive, cannot say enough about her.  

So,whether you live in Portland or are visiting, do not hesitate to go there."
566,"Contemporary, upscale. Uncomplicated but limited menu, according to my taste. Service was pleasant. Prices were pricey. $4 cup of coffee is high. I would not order what I had again. (egg white frittata with spinach, mushroom, tofu.) Slice of wheat toast had substance. Fingerling home fried potatoes were very tasty. Hubby had huevo rancheros, and liked it enough to have it again, but admitted he'd had better. Presentation was simple, creative and pleasing. Still not a fan of what I ordered, or the price of a cup of joe, which is the reason for only 3 stars."
567,"we came here for breakfast on a Wednesday; the food was very good, except for the kids french toast which had very little egg!
there are many servers and managers on the floor, but they are so disorganized they were very slow. nice, but not efficient. i
got my coffee quickly but waited for 10 minutes for milk and sugar. 
we had the hash - delicious! - and the croissant with ham and cheese. very very good, and the presentation was beautiful. also, EXCELLENT coffee!"
568,"The complexity of spices they incorporate into one meal is an act of love for each customer. We loved our server he was extremely proud of the hotel and restaurant it was refreshing to say the least. Over all excellent service, eye catching decor, and magnificent Brussel sprouts."
569,"We had a very good dinner with an out of town guest this past weekend, on our third visit to the restaurant. Grilled brussel sprouts with aioli and fresh peas with bacon were the vegetable standouts. The smoked tomato soup was outstanding, as was the pasta with crabmeat. In a town with many great restaurants, Union held its own."
570,"I was dying to try Union and check out The Press Hotel since the first buzz. Farm to table in a cool hotel seemed like a great experience/date night. 

The atmosphere was cool but it wasn't what I expected. I thought the attention to theme would spill over from the hotel part to the restaurant. Not a huge deal. Just an observation. 

The food was good, but I wasn't blown away. 

For apps we got a seasonal salad and a poached egg (served in jars over mushrooms & whipped ricotta-yum!)

There were a decent amount of vegetarian small plate options but entrees offered the one tried and true risotto. It was a blue cheese risotto with walnut pesto. Flavorful enough but not the best I've ever had.

Service was great and attentive! I got up to use the rest room (have to walk through the lobby of the hotel) and placed my napkin on the table. Someone came around and replaced it with a freshly folded one."
571,"We went to Union last night after looking at multiple different options. It was our first night in Portland and we thought the reviews were promising - and let me tell you, I don't regret going at all. 

I got the three course tasting menu, and my girlfriend got three courses to match so that the timing we consistent. The tasting menu last night was mushroom based which was amazing. The chef came and told us about it and I was immediately sold. The staff was welcoming and the ambiance was warm and friendly (the press Hotel is also beautiful). 

I started wth a mushroom frisée salad with local apples and sherry. It was beautiful light and delicious with hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the crispy Brussels sprouts with walnuts and she didn't speak to me because she was too busy enjoying the food! That's when you know it's delicious. Our entrees were taking awhile, but we were too busy speaking to really notice - however the chef sent over a mini course for us (complimentary) of a cauliflower purée with muscles. This unexpected course was actually the best delight of the entire night. It was as my girlfriend said, ""one of the lightest and most flavorful dishes"" she's ever had! 

As an entree we I had wagyu beef with all kinds of locally foraged mushrooms and fingerling potatoes and my girlfriend had salmon with beets. Both were wonderful. 

The whole experience, including desserts was well worth the money and time. Most importantly, I'd encourage trusting the chef with the tasting menu and follow the recommendations of the staff! They won't lead you astray. Hats off to this restaurant for a wonderful first dinner in Portland."
572,"We come for cocktails in a lovely environment, and have enjoyed it each time. Sometimes we come on a date night, sometime with friends. The drinks are always lovely, and the space is particularly nice. The art in display can't be beat - Erin Hutton's typewriter installation, Matt Hutton's incredible woodworked table, and other contemporary artists are on display. 

*update for brunch*

They don't serve their full breakfast menu on Sunday mornings, and their brunch menu is limited and upscale. 

Excellent coffee and espresso. The decor is very modern, somewhat industrial and very appealing. The kitchen is open and you can watch them cook and expedite. 

I had the Brioche Galette with goat cheese, sundried tomato, an over easy egg, shaved speck, and asparagus. Very rich and flavorful. 

The spouse had the arugula salad (no nuts) and added salmon. She enjoyed it, which is good as there were not a lot of gluten free options on the brunch menu."
573,"Recently breakfasted here and what a pleasant romp. The decor, design & architecture are a feast for the eyes. Our Bloody Mary was perfectly balanced. The service was prompt and friendly. My hash was unique & delicious. A tad pricey at the end but worth every penny! Will definitely be back!"
574,One of my favorite restaurants in Portland. Always a vegan or vegetarian option. Amazing service always love our servers!! Roomy and not crowded.
575,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to try the hot new restaurant ""Union"" and stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday. We walked into the restaurant which is part of a hotel and waited at the host stand for someone to seat us or just greet us. 

The restaurant was empty except for a 3 top in the dining room. We didn't see a hostess, a waitress or bartender. After several minutes, a bartender (or barback?) appeared and started pouring ice into the bar directly in front of us. He didn't not look up, doesn't say hello, and doesn't acknowledge our existence at all. I see the chef and make eye contact, but he quickly returns to what he's doing.

We patiently wait even longer watching the bartender unload ice and not look at us. After waiting another several minutes, we start to feel completed ignored and contemplate leaving, which we never do. Having come from the restaurant industry, we can make a lot of excuses, but this was unacceptable. 

We walk out with a feeling no customer should ever have, unwelcome. I get that this place is super fancy now, but this is no way to treat any customer, especially ones that would have dined well and probably would have come back if it was as good as they say. 

I guess we'll never know. Good luck getting noticed at this place.

576,"I apologize in advance for the novel, but I want you, reader, to know just how incredible this meal, and very special night, was. 

Saturday evening my fiancé (though she didn't know it yet) sat down for our dinner at Union. First off, given that I'd be proposing at the end of that meal I'd been in close communication with the staff in making arrangements so that this meal would be perfect, and it needs to be said that they were incredibly accommodating and kind through the whole process. 
To that effect, when we walked in, we were met by a very friendly host who led us to our table, where a bottle of delicious sparkling rosé was waiting, chilling, for us. Our server, was bubbly and informative, quickly and easily answered all of our questions and smoothly transitioned us into our meal. 
The first course was a season cheese plate that featured a cloth bound cheddar, a mild yet dynamic bleu, and this incredible triple creme whose name I sadly can't remember (even sadder now that I realize I can't track it down to buy without a name), a fig jam, whipped local honey, and toasted walnuts. That bleu was delicious, but the triple creme was easily one of the most delicious cheeses I've consumed, with the ash line running through its center adding a delightful smokiness. 
After the cheeses we ordered the caramelized lamb belly served over white beans, toasted pistachios, and roasted garlic purée, and all I can say is that if a mouth could orgasm, it would with this dish. The lamb's belly was wound like a pinwheel and had a delightful, sweet, crisp to its outside before you make it to the buttery, herbed, and lightly gamey inner layers. The beans were sweet and earthy and were beautifully complimented by the warmth of the pistachios, and the garlic purée was just that perfect extra touch that tied it all together. 
The mains were equally decadent, flavorful, and intricate. I ordered the chef's interpretation of a Surf 'n turf: seared scallops with braised ox tail, roasted shallots, and some sort of a pea purée. Magic. Pure magic. The brine of the scallops melded perfectly with the grounded sweetness of the ox tail, as the smokey, near caramel, notes of the roasted shallots balanced any remaining bite of the other flavors. All in all, an absolutely incredible dish!
Last but not least, dessert. Having just proposed after the last dish, the restaurant brought out a small, yet decadent, plate of treats for us. At the bottom was a truly out-of-this world chocolate cake. Stacked above that was a bar of semi-frozen chocolate moussed that was airy and dissolved on your tongue; next to those two was a shard of cocoa-nib meringue, jutting from a dollop of fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream. Each element on its own was delicious, but the real fun came in combining them in various configurations. Additionally, the desserts were paired with a lovely sweet Argentinian dessert wine, much like a port, but cleaner. 

All in all, between the extraordinary staff, and equally incredible food, Union is a culinary experience that no one should miss, and is particularly well suited to those who want a romantic, and truly special, night to remember."
577,"Stopped into Union for lunch with coworkers and was very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was dead, which made me nervous since that usually means it isn't that good but that was not the case whatsoever. The five of us, who were here for work for a week and ate at several different spots, all agreed that this was one of our favorite lunch spots. I got the chicken panini with kale pesto and it was absolutely delicious. The foccacia bread it came on was fresh and soft. As a side I got the fingerling fries, which were also delicious.

Service is a little slow but that's what you expect at a hotel restaurant typically anyway. Between the slower service, and the locally produced maine sodas, which I found very odd tasting, it is a solid four stars for me."
578,"I love this restaurant! The first time we came was opening week when they had a limited menu. It was great then, but it is even better now! I have a house on Peaks Island and get into Portland a lot during the summer. How this magnificent restaurant continues to stay under the radar amazes me. Great atmosphere, inspired cuisine and excellent service. No crowds, few tourists, no hype and a terrific value.
UNION never disappoints! The solid kitchen team cranks out delicious farm to table fare that is fresh and interesting. The food at UNION rivals Eventide, Central Provisions and Fore Street. Every staff member is well trained and professional, great wine list, tasty drink menu and a generous pour from the bar. My daughter and I decided to share 2 entrees and waiter took note, the kitchen split plated for us, and our already good experience got even better.
Do not come to Portland and miss this elegant dining experience. When you need a culinary oasis UNION is your spot."
579,"The food was utterly fantastic and the wait staff was very kind. We ordered a bunch of stuff to try a few different things, with the intention of taking the left over food home. Apparently this isn't an option here as they gathered our plates, stacked them on each other and then threw our food away without asking. I wanted my food. Very Weird."
580,"We enjoyed a great breakfast at Union this morning. Ordering oatmeal and fruit seemed rather mundane, though we wondered what ""homemade raisins"" might offer. The raisins, along with the berries, were amazingly flavorful. The blueberry muffin had a nice crisp top and loads of blueberries.  And the service from Leonard? Truly outstanding. He was attentive, but also fun and energetic and truly helpful in giving us sightseeing hints.  Union and The Press Hotel are well worth the visit!"
581,"May have been our favorite meal in Portland. We tried all sorts of apps and split out Cod dinner which was excellent. The Crab pasta app was incredible, probably the highlight of the evening. You also must get the brussel sprouts as a large side, more than enough to share among 2-4 ppl."
582,"Came here for breakfast , we were looking for something light after a night of drinking and we got the exact breakfast we were looking for. Avocado toast was ripe and well seasoned. The simple beginning had fresh fruit although the croissant, ham and cheese chunks wasn't a complete meal in my opinion. On a normal day I feel this type of breakfast would leave me hungry for more but on that day it fit the mood."
583,"Dreadful food.  Attractive decor. Fishy pasta. Bready ""lobster"" roll with little lobster. Food tasted old, uninspired, yet pretentious. Eggs Benedict:  eggs undercooked, Hollandaise congealed (it did not flow) and sparse. Strange servers."
584,"Second visit one year on, and again our meal was delicious. Good lamb starter and duck for main course were excellent. On a 'white out snow storm' evening the place was surprisingly full, and the staff were delightful. Good bottle of Barbera... 

Still excellent it has no bloody TV's!"
585,"The food was good and diverse. The small plates are very tempting and delicious so we went for those instead of the large plates. The cheese and charcuterie boards are large and tasty. The pork belly is tender and flavorful. The service is not the greatest. Our server would disappear where we couldn't see her to get her attention. Parking is expensive, which is a given for the location, so the best bet is the lot across the street. Debating on returning."
586,Waited 20 minutes for drinks with an empty bar.  Don't visit the union if u want good service.  Charcuterie at $22 was more nuts and olives than meat and cheese.  Won't be returning to the Union anytime soon.
587,"Amazing. We had the hardest time finding a place to eat brunch on New Year's Day without having to wait hours, but the Union got us right in. Even if we had to wait, the bar was big, and there were plenty of beautiful couches and chairs right next to the bar with a gorgeous view. 
They catered to my gluten free needs spectacularly. I had the first gluten free Eggs Benedict of my life, and it was superb. Delicious bloodys and mimosas. The staff was super  helpful and polite. 
We left full and satisfied, absolutely no complaints."
588,"This restaurant is my new favorite! The food couldn't be more amazing. And the wait 
staff was better than I've ever experienced. Their suggestion for wine was spot on. The special shrimp dish of the night had umami flavors that were indescribable! And the desserts were just plain joyful! Have the plate of confections - or the peach ice cream sandwich!   And if you want a perfect night, book a room at The Press Hotel, where the restaurant is located, so you can have a leisurely evening and not have far to go when it it over!"
589,"This was probably the best dining experience of my life. My boyfriend and I were in Portland for our anniversary and let the restaurant know on their online reservation form. They went way above ""above and beyond"" helping make our night special. They sat us at the chef's table, where we were treated to glasses of champagne and two delicious appetizers. We got the burrata with roasted squash and pumpkin butter, which I honestly did not want to ever be finished because it was so delicious. The chef and manager checked in on us often, chatted with us and made us feel like they genuinely wanted us and the other patrons to have a memorable and enjoyable time at their restaurant. I got the hanger steak which was out of this world, and my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about his rabbit. Thank you so much to the staff at Union for making our evening so wonderful and for the absolutely OUTSTANDING food!"
590,"One of the best breakfasts I've had, period. The raisins that come with the oatmeal are made in house. Eggs Benedict were done flawlessly. Decor is crisp yet not cold. What a pleasant experience. In The Press Hotel, which is worth a visit if only to see the wall of typewriters and other newspaper relics."
591,"Excellent execution of breakfast. Avocado toast was fantastic. Smoked Salmon and accoutrements were very good. Flannel hash was OK. Eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, though the lobster add-on not worth the extra $12. Would come back for lunch or dinner."
592,"This has been our favorite meal in Portland so far, both for the wonderful service and the delectable dinner we had here. 

The flash-seared tuna was the best dish of the night, and the scallops were a close-second. The burrata dish was also delicious, paired with the great olive oil and fresh spring peas. 

Pair that with the well-crafted cocktails, good wine, and cheese plate to finish and this place gets our seal of approval. 

PS- Sarah was the best waitress ever!"
593,"This restaurant is in a hotel. Why do I start my review with that qualifier?  I'm not sure, just as I'm not sure why all restaurants in a hotel have a certain feel. They just do. There is a certain formula that combines trendiness with blandness and spits out the quintessential hotel restaurant that serves food good enough to get by in middle America but not for the exceptional food scene that is Portland, ME. 

It's not bad, it's just not great. And that's the issue, in a city of food greatness, this just doesn't measure up. 

P.S. The food was cold."
594,"We stopped at Union before a show at the Merrill Auditorium for drinks and hors d'oeuvres. Amazing food the truffle laced potato chips were sublimely simple. The ""Cheese and Charcuterie"" (the Chef's seasonal selection of local cheeses and artisan meats along with local honey, fig jam, walnuts, and bread) flavorful. Finally, the bartender was very thoughtful in his drink preparation. A great visit."
595,"Lovely lunch today. First time -staff very accommodating and friendly.  Truffle chips were excellent-salads all fresh with nice variety of ingredients.  Bright and inviting atmosphere.  Had the added pleasure of watching a wedding party go across the street to City Hall. Our waiter told us there is still a ""tunnel"" bit not useable-what fun that would be to explore underground Portland??"
596,"Awesome new addition to the Portland dining scene!  The decor is modern, open and fun, and the crowd appeared to be a mix of young hipsters, hotel guests, middle-aged foodies, and local professionals.  The menu was both incredibly creative and wholly welcoming.  Plenty of interesting choices, but nothing fully ""expected.""  We started with two perfectly made cocktails, fresh and obviously with local ingredients.  Moved on to their wines by the glass list, which avoids the cliche brands and has some well-priced, interesting options.  

For appetizers, we had the local burrata -- a creamy, delicious mozzarella served with thin crisps and freshly shelled peas; and the clean-tasting ""compressed peaches"" salad which included cured ham and kale.  Main courses were exceptional.  My wife loved the steak -- cooked perfectly medium rare, then sliced and served with an earthy combination of trumpet mushrooms and fingerling potatoes.  The gold star, however, went to the confit of lamb leg, served with heirloom carrots.  The flavor was spectacular:  almost caramelized, with a touch of sweetness mixed with lightly salted meatiness.  Holy yum-ness!  The service was super professional and responsive, and the whole team worked together to support each other.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of this creative, comfortable menu!"
597,Beautiful meal! Had the cleanse drink no ice to start. Followed by the hash and the corn fritters.
598,This place has nice atmosphere... the chef is amazing. The staff is warm and friendly. The duck I had was cooked to perfection. The sauce for the duck was not too sweet with just the right hints of orange. Worth every penny and not cheap but you don't leave engorged with food so you can still enjoy dessert which they have. I recommend the chocolate pudding!
599,Had Father's Day breakfast with my dad who was staying there for the weekend. There were four of us and we all had a fantastic meal. Service was excellent. Decor delightful. Big improvement from the last time!
600,"Every sandwich I've had from this place has been great, every chicken wing I've had from this place has been great. If you like pulled pork get the pulled pork sandwich it's everything you want and more. Big sandwiches, barbecue sauce fingers, and the best coconut macaroons you will ever have. Seriously though. If you are in search for the best desserts in Portland, the $1 coconut macaroons are in my top 5."
601,"I have driven by this place a thousand times and never desired to go in. My husband has had sandwiches from here and has never been disappointed. We traveled over one Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The menu was easy to read and has a lot to offer. The biscuit menu alone was inviting. 
I decided on the pulled pork potato skins topped with their cajun coleslaw and my husband went with the Poor boy cheese burger sandwich with a side of french fries.  The pulled pork potato skins were AMAZING! Three potato skins FILLED with pulled pork covered with melted cheese and topped with coleslaw and drizzled with BBQ sauce. I couldn't eat it all it was so filling.  
My husbands sandwich was HUGE! It looked like three hamburgers were on that thing, he wiped it off before I could see what was with it. Fries were cooked perfectly as well.
What a great place and to think I've been driving by all these years, no longer :)"
602,"For many years I managed musicians from New Orleans, and when we were on tour, we often had well-meaning people who wanted to feed us New Orleans cuisine for the band meal.  It always fell WAY short, to the point where I had to put a caveat in the band's rider, no New Orleans food without checking with the management first. As a result, I am always a little dubious of restaurants outside the Crescent City, claiming to be the real deal. I decided to give Po Boys and pickles a shot, the menu seemed authentic enough, and when I walked in, it had all the right trappings of a Nola-centric restaurant. 

I decided to get the muffaletta, a classic Nola sandwich made famous by the Central Market and others. It is basically an Italian cold cut sandwich with an olive salad. It usually has mortadella, salami, capicola, and a good provolone cheese. I figured with ""pickles"" in their name, they would have a really great olive salad.  The sandwich was a major disappointment, the olive salad was barely discernable on the sandwich, about all you could taste in it was oregano. The cold cuts were bland American, mostly ham, and the provolone cheese was more like a very mild colby.  The sandwich came toasted, unlike a real muffaletta, and there was also lettuce and tomato, not typically found on the traditional version. All in all, it was like a typical ""American Cold Cut"" sub, nothing remotely New Orleans about it. Also, the $7.50 1/2 loaf was pretty small by New Orleans standards, but I'm glad I didn't pop for the full loaf for 15.00

Maybe I'll giver them another shot with a fried shrimp or something someday, but I won't be rushing back there. Chalk it up as yet another swing and a miss from a well-meaning restaurant. It leaves me still seeking a real Nola restaurant outside the state of LA."
603,Slower service but pretty good food. Their biscuits aren't the flakiest or buttery like I was expecting but they were fine. The pulled pork and slaw was delicious but needed more heat. The Cajun fries had a nice spice to it and was very soft which I don't mind but if you like crispy fries I'm not sure this would do it for you. Overall good flavors and fresh flavor. Very busy even at 3pm
604,"There is a line out the door at lunch everyday for a reason. They rock! It's definitely not fast food, expect to wait but real food takes time to make! They are the real deal, lots of options. Definitely your authentic southern experience. No gluten free bread, but they have plenty of salads and sides to choose from. They also have unique shakes, like chai tea! This is definitely feel good food. And snaps for some parking!"
605,First time trying Po' Boys and fell in love. Their fried pickles are to die for. I'm really picky about them and these were perfect. They came with a semi-Spivey aioli that really complemented them. I also got a 1/2 muffuletta and it was excellent. The bread with really light and fluffy but had a really nice crust.
606,"Wow this was so good ! I got the falafel salad $8.50 which comes with great fresh ingredients and some delicious falafel, they also included 2 types of salad dressing also delicious. Really tasty but wished there was more falafel in it .  We also got Louisiana gumbo which was also very good, wishes for a couple more shrimp . Sad to say I was not there on a weekend so I missed out on the biscuits, will definitely go back on a weekend . Topped it off with a scrumptious coconut macaroon, I had heard these were pretty amazing and I must agree.
Place was really clean and staff was really friendly and cheerful."
607,"When you're driving through town, it's a place that can easily be overlooked. We used to come here a lot until, like many, we ate the shrimp. That turned us off for a while. 

We came back for the first time in probably 6 months. It was average. It filled the void of wanting something in the neighborhood without heading into town. 

We got there before the rush, so the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered the cheeseburger po' boy, the atomic special and a side order of fries. It might have been our fault for ordering the special, but it felt as though it was advertised as a grilled cheese. We were amped about that and then somewhat let down. No part of the description said ""burger"" was in it. This meant we ended up with two burger sandwiches to share and totally were not expecting that. The cheeseburger po' boy is our go-to. You get a lot of meat for the cheap cost of $6 for a regular. 

I can't really decide what the deal is with the fries. Some taste salty and some taste sweet. I am not a fan of sweet fries (and no I don't mean sweet potato), so that was a bit of a setback. 

The prices are actually decent for the amount of food you get. We also had a Portland Dine Around card which got us buy one regular sandwich, get one regular free. 

As a close to home place that's decent, it's a place to which we will be back."
608,"How can you serve po boys if you don't serve Boudin Po Boys?! Being from the south, cajun food is my all time favorite. The flavor, the spice, what more can you ask for. After not having a boudin po boy, I ordered the creole sausage po boy along with a cup of gumbo. This was the second worst rendition of a cajun meal I have ever had. Sadly, will have to wait to return to the south for my next cajun meal!"
609,"Yes. Yes. Yes.  

PO. Boys has some of the BEST sandwiches in Portland. I can't get enough of the surf and turf sandwich. Perfectly roasted beef and crispy fried shrimp with gravy tomato and lettuce.  The crusty French bread is the perfect conduit for that interior getting into my mouth.

I also highly recommend the Cajun fries.  

I've had almost everything off this menu, and I haven't been disappointed once.  From a beet salad to the falafel sandwich, it's literally ALL good.

They also have some of the beat beer specials in Portland. Monday and Tuesday, 2.50$ drafts. Did I mention their milkshakes are amazing, too!

Enjoy!"
610,"A taste of Louisiana (or as close as so can tell, not having been there...) in southern Maine. We almost always make a stop here on our way through and I look forward to it every time. Really hearty, stuffed-full sandwiches with fun names and a ton of variety. My kids love the fries and onion rings and we always get them a cheeseburger sub to share because it's enormous! Their fish is fresh, the batter is crunchy, the sandwiches are stacked with the freshest lettuce and tomatoes, and the dining area is full of high tops and twinkle lights. It's a small space but they make good use of it and will bring your food to the table so you aren't hanging out at the window for forever. 

  A Portland staple. Don't miss it."
611,"FOOD: 6.5/10
SERVICE: 8/10
AMBIENCE: 7/10
RECCOMENDATION: poo poo platter

Don't understand how this place has 4.5 stars. To my surprise there was quite a lot of people grabbing food here. The service here was good but the Jumbalaya was average and the iced coffee was also only decent. The best thing here was probably the po boy special. But even that, the sandwhich had no flavor and I had to ask for some tar tar sauce. I have nothing against this place but I definitely will not be coming here ever again."
612,"The pickles are homemade, and yes there are Po' Boys here; I tried a couple of different things when I visited this place. The line was short, service was quick. They claim to have Cajun influence, and that itself was pretty tempting. 

The bread is good, and crispy, the seafood isn't too bad. I had oysters and shrimp; and the dirty bird. The seafood had much protein inside, but there was a light base of sauce. Which was bad for me, I love sauce. The dirty bird contained garlic mayo, white chicken breast, with lettuce and tomato. It's not bad, but not what I was really expecting. The Cajun fries were mediocre too. 

Overall, this place has a lot of hype, but I wouldn't get your hopes up too much about sandwiches. Although, everyone in line seemed to be buying ice cream. I guess I'll have to reconsider my order."
613,"Finally made the stop here and SO GLAD I DID!! We ordered our sandwiches and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. I went a little rogue with my order and they didn't seem to mind. I got the Reuben with cole slaw, instead of kraut, on sourdough. YUMM. I've actually been dreaming about it since so will definitely be going back sooner rather than later!!"
614,"My blackened fish Sandwich from Po' Boys and pickles transported me straight to the south! They create authentic Louisiana food with skill, using traditional leidenheimer bread which resembles a soft sub roll with a thin, crispy crust. Sandwiched between the French bread was flaky white fish seasoned with Cajun spices and topped with creamy coleslaw. All of the ingredients contributed to the excellent flavor that made the sandwich irresistible. It tasted even better knowing that this quality seafood sandwich was $8.50!

I can't wait to return so that I can eat more of their homemade pickles, french fries, fried seafood, and other po' boys. If the other menu options are as good as the blackened fish sandwich, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."
615,"Many good things going for it. The fried seafood is fresh and perfectly crisp. Bread is the right kind of puffy, chewy, slightly crusty. There is a solid array of Shipyard and other beers on tap. Shakes/frappes are a great conclusion to your meal, with many flavors you won't find at your local scoop shop. The array of menu items should meet almost anyone's needs, and portions range from ""that's a pretty good lunch for $7"" to ""how did I eat this whole thing?""

So why the four stars? They are missing that true N'Awlins spice. Pepper aoli was basically mayonnaise. None of the seafood had that little dusting of Cajun seasoning you'd hope for. And there's no Abita, despite them having the signs on the wall to get my hopes up.

It's still a really solid lunch place on your way through Portland for road trips, vacation, etc."
616,Great food. Great service. Falafel Po boy stuffed w delicious veggies. Falafel well seasoned. I would highly recommend !
617,"This place had delicious food (the coleslaw was phenomenal) and is a really cool idea. Unfortunately when we came it was only kids working, no adult supervision and the wait was asinine. Along with that our orders were messed up. It seems that these teenagers are just set up to fail which is unfortunate because of the potential this place holds. 

Maybe we just came on a bad day, however it wasn't too busy and ultimately our experience was a let down."
618,"I really wanted to love this place. I came here with my boyfriend who had been here before and raves about how amazing it was. 

Walking in it's a tiny shop, seemed to be somewhat clean, and a decent size menu was hanging up. There's also a board with specials up if you feel like trying something new. 

I ordered the shrimp po boy, I was so looking forward to it! Unfortunately, a piece of breading fell off my shrimp and revealed how dirty it was. I don't know that they were cleaned at all. It was just off putting. I felt like the sandwich was also a little dry. It had lettuce tomato and a little mayo I believe or some type of sauce. It was just a little too light on the sauce and especially with such a dense piece of bread that every bite just felt dry. I also tried my boyfriends blackened fish sandwich. It was good but just not the ""wow"" I was looking for. 

On the other hand, their macaroons were out of this world! So soft on the inside it was like chewing on a cloud. 

I would definitely go back to try other menu items, especially with such a friendly staff."
619,"I frequent this place but I must've came on a bad night.

I placed an order for pickup and maybe it was because it was close to closing time but my order of Cajun fries were hella stale and not seasoned well. 

My sandwich was average as well. 

I'll be looking to order from elsewhere if I'm hungry at night."
620,"Yummy! Friendly! Great blackening and pickles- WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?! 

We were starving and wanted something fast, yummy, between bread pieces- this place delivered. I had the blackened fish Po boy and was impressed! The blackening was smoky and packed a kick without being too salty or overpowering! 

My wife's blt was really good and the bread was the what made it! Fresh, Fluffy and crunchy at the same time! Highly recommend!"
621,"So damn good! Expensive but totally worth it. We got two sandwiches and they were both really great and large! The blackened cod and the chorizo were both enough to hold us over for most of the day. Atmosphere was fun, upbeat and clean. 

Worthy of mention the young guy behind the counter really took the time to explain things to us and suggest the best sellers which was great and helped out quite a bit. Highly recommend you try the fish! Very good. Not heavy either. I ate 3/4 of the thing and didnt need a nap! Cheers"
622,I travel down south a lot. But this place brings me back!! The golden shrimp P.O. boy with horseradish mayo was amazing! Perfect bread and the shrimp was perfectly fried. Fried pickles were great. I also tried the Key Lime Pie milkshake.....so good
623,"Finally got to try this beloved Portland staple. We were glad to see a variety of meat and veggie options, and the french fries and pickles were great. The blackened fish salad was terrific--pickled veggies in the salad were delicious. But why only 3 stars? We got a fried shrimp basket and a shrimp po boy, and none of the shrimp were deveined. It's not a big deal of the shrimp are fairly clean already, but these had very noticeable large black veins. I know this might not be a huge issue for some, but it's a dealbreaker for a couple of members of my family. I wish I could do 3.5 stars, because we will probably go back and try some more non-shrimp menu items."
624,"I freaking LOVE this place! 
Just to put it into perspective, he brought a cooler with ice packs so we could bring some food back to Massachusetts. You do crazy things for the food you love.

First of all, I love their sign. It has a cute little pickle on it that looks like it was designed fifty years ago. Super funky and old-school.

The restaurant itself is certainly nothing to write home about stylistically. It's a counter with some tables and high-tops inside and some picnic tables outside. 

BUT THE FOOD!
I got the Uptown which included falafel, roasted red peppers and onions, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and red pepper mayo. This is THE BEST falafel I have ever had. It's flat like miniature hockey pucks, not round how it is typically served and it is not dry in the slightest. The center was green and tender and the spice mixture was out of this world.

He got the Dirty Bird which included roasted chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and garlic mayo.
We also got a side of fried pickles which were unique and ridiculously good; they peel their pickles and fry the slivers so each piece is crispy and thin. The portion was so large we could hardly finish it.

It is also worth noting that the bread here is INSANE- flaky French bread you have to try to believe.

We ended up buying a Dirty Bird and a quart of pickles to take back to Massachusetts with us (in a cooler, I kid you not). We also got T-shirts for $15 each. They don't have women's sizes so I had to get a men's small which is huge on me. They were able to find him a large, but it took some digging in their back room. It might be a good idea to expand their inventory to include merchandise for women as well as ordering higher quantities of the more common sizes. 

You absolutely cannot go wrong with Po' Boys and Pickles. After you try it once, you'll never want to eat anywhere else in Portland every again."
625,"Ordered the Cajun fries, and fried pickles. The food was good but a little too salty for my taste. True comfort food. The Decor inside has a cool vintage feel. Overall a nice experience."
626,"So disappointed. 

The fist time we came they were totally out of seafood. No shrimp, oysters or fish. We left.

Came in again today, they seemed a bit busy but only one person ahead of us. 
Ordered the blackened fish regular po boy, a side of pickled veg, and the peacemaker large size (fried shrimp and oysters), and a side of fried pickles. $35. We were never told there may be a wait. 

Ten minutes go by, then twenty, then thirty. I ask what is taking so long? They say our order is two back. Another ten minutes go by, then twenty and finally after 50 minutes of waiting we get our food. During this time we saw many pissed off people leave and some others come back with wrong orders including someone who got a falafel sandwich with no falafel in it. My fiancé checked the bag quickly and no pickled veg but luckily we were still there so they gave us our pickled veg. Close call!

Get home to eat and there is also a bacon sandwich in the bag. So, our dog got to eat someone's lunch. Not sure if the employees are just incompetent or what but they really need a better system here. 

My blackened fish was alright. Nothing special. It was also really small (maybe 4 inches) and did not fill me up at all. The picked vegetables and fried pickles were actually very good. The large peacemaker was more of what you'd expect size-wise for ordering a sub (except with a $15 price tag). What really horrified me was the fact that the shrimp were not cleaned all all. 

Slow and inefficient service, inaccurate orders, small, expensive sandwiches with dirty seafood..... No thanks!"
627,"From the 4 1/2 star rating this place has, I expected life-changing sandwiches but was frankly a little disappointed. 

My mom and I shared the Surf and Turf and Blackened Fish sandwiches, each ordering a full one (which is a pretty hefty size that will definitely fill you up). I was let down by the lack of flavor and seasoning, especially with the Surf and Turf because there was nothing bringing together the fried shrimp and roast beef besides a thin layer of mayonnaise. Individually the components were pretty good (beef was very tender and the shrimp was nice and crispy!) but I had to add a lot of hot sauce to my sandwich in order to give it enough taste. 

The Blackened Fish was smoky and a bit more flavorful, yet I was expecting some more punch from the Cajun coleslaw and red pepper mayo, which just tasted like normal mayo. 

It's definitely a good place to stop if you need a beefy sandwich to curb your hunger, but don't come looking for one that's going to blow your taste buds away (though I may come back to try their key lime pie or Mexican hot chocolate milkshake that I had been eyeing)."
628,"Delicious comfort food for cheap! Friendly staff, excellent service. 
*Peacemaker - this is a MUST-order! Po boy with fried oysters AND shrimp, the red pepper mayo is simply divine. I love po boys and this did not disappoint - compares to New Orleans goodness! 
*Pulled pork: tasty, hefty amount of meat, topped with good slaw
*Blackened fish salad: outstanding, huge portion (easily shareable for 3) - flaky, blackened fish on a huge bed of mixed greens, pickled veggies, nicely dressed with a red wine vinaigrette.
- Gumbo - the only letdown, a bit watery compared to the real deal, though had a decent amount of chicken, shrimp and andouille sausage.

Highly recommend this off-the-beaten-path joint in Portland - family loved it!"
629,"I stopped here for lunch the other day ... thought that a cajun fish salad would be reasonably healthy and, of course, tasty.  It was way overpriced for just a soggy cold piece of fish, sitting on a bed of romaine lettuce with not much else.  The coffee had no relation to New Orleans coffee.

In short a completely uninteresting and uninviting bowl with a little food -- certainly not worth $10.99 plus $2 for some weak coffee!"
630,"Po' Boys and Pickles didn't impress.  I ate there 2X.  Same results = meh.  First and foremost the venue is ""pricey"" yet, that's my opinion and you may surely disagree.  I base price upon value and quality.  I spend a lot of time in Maine where I hail, yet work in Texas,  Often, I get to Louisiana where Muffaletta's rule,  Frankly, the Po' Boys Muffaletta's pale by comparison.  I credit the owners for offering up something different in the fine city of Portland and staunchly support local restaurants."
631,"Ok so let me preface this review with the fact that I was on vacation and therefore a little bummed that I tried this place, only because I wasted a meal on an average experience vice a stellar one.

Ambiance/Service: Pretty nondescript. It used to be some other fast food place that got re purposed. Plastic mardi gras beads and pictures printed from an inkjet adorned the walls for decorations (pretty tacky... even for this place). Service was friendly and quick. 

Food: I got a small peacemaker, I mean how could I say no to fried shrimp and oysters. I just found it pretty unmemorable. The red pepper mayo was pretty bland (definitely needs some added kick), and the oysters and shrimp were previously frozen so you definitely lose some credibility being this close to the coast. Wife got the muffaletta...again nothing wrong with the sandwich per se, but I feel if I can make it myself better than you with bread,meat,cheese, olive tapenade from the store than your New Orleans style cuisine you need to up the quality of your sandwich. 

Overall: Sure if you live here give this place a shot, if not a fan no worries try something else next time. If on vacation absolutely not, there are better places in the same price range, and Portland has a pretty phenomenal selection of excellent choices."
632,"I'm from the South originally (a few hours from New Orleans), so I love po boys. We've passed by this place so many times but when Susan's was closed, we decided to try it out. We ordered fried pickles and two po' boys. My fiance got the Debris, whereas I got the Surf and Turf. They're essentially the same po' boy, but the Surf and Turf comes with fried shrimp. 

The pickles came first, and boy were they delicious. The batter is cornmeal-based and complements the pickles so well. Probably one of the best renditions of fried pickles I've ever had. The remoulade sauce that went with it was great as well. 

The po' boys were a disappointment. As much as I wanted to like them, they just didn't taste like the po' boys I was used to. There weren't enough condiments on top, so the sandwich itself was dry. The debris needed more flavor. It tasted like it was missing something. I ended up having to add ketchup and mayo to my po' boy to give it a little more oomph. The portion sizes were very generous, but I just wasn't feeling it and didn't want to take my leftovers home. 

The place itself is really neat. Clean, fun, and unpretentious atmosphere. The servers were super nice. Their menu sounds delicious, with tons of Zapp's flavors on offer and milkshakes and bread pudding for dessert. I just wish the execution of their po' boys had been better."
633,This place is damned good. Easy place to get some delicious sandwiches. Parking is fair and with looking for a spot if the lot is full.
634,"I'm only giving them 2 stars, because of their food.  They lost me with customer service.  I've been in the business for over 10 years, and I've never felt the need to go out of my way to write a bad review, rather than stop being a patron and move on.  Rude, from the beginning when my wife called to order some po' boys.  After being put on hold--they're busy I get it--they hung up on her.  Called back, and said we lost connection.  The employee just replied with, ""What do you want, are you ready?""  After placing the order, we said thank you, and were rudely responded to--again--with ""yup."" I'm not looking to be waited on or have my ass kissed, but please at the very least have some minimal manners with your customers."
635,"Excellent sandwiches. Went twice and both times were exactly what you want out of a restaurant.

I will definitely go again. Keep up the good work."
636,"This place is still winning. Mmmmm :)
Every time I get that itch, I resolve it with a sandwich from Po'Boys. 
I need to pay a visit very soon."
637,Worst sandwich I have ever had. Ordered dirty bird. Came with lettuce tomato I garlic mayo. Sandwich was dry and I did not get a hint of mayo.
638,Classic portland grub. Quality blackened catfish southern style.  Great place for a lunch break
639,"We stopped here on our way out of town t grab a quick bit and am I ever glad that we did.  Let me start off by saying that the place small fantastic and had me salivating the whole time I was waiting for my food.  We couldn't decide what to get so we placed a rather large order :)  We got the Boudin Balls, the Gumbo, the Cajun Fries, the Angry Pig Sandwich, and the BLT Po' Boy, along with the salted caramel shake.
The Boudin Balls tasted really good, and the mustard dipping sauce that went with them paired nicely.  They seemed to be quite small in comparison to the boudin balls that I have had before, but with the smaller size they were easier to eat while driving :)
My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Gumbo.  It wasn't too spicy, had lots of flavor, and lot of meat in it.
The seasoning on the Cajun Fries was awesome.  I couldn't eat them fast enough.
The Angry Pig Sandwich was one of the best that I have ever had.  The fried bread that it was one was fantastic.
And they absolutely nailed the BLT.
But the best part of the whole experience was the Salted Caramel Milkshake.  It was absolutely magnificent!  Seriously one of the best milkshakes that I have even had. 

I plan to be back quite soon to do this all over again :)"
640,Solid place. Yummy food. Fun easy spot and a bit eclectic. Biscuits are a must but get there before they run out.
641,"Awesome food and a selection of great beer makes this my favorite lunch spot in the UNE area

Sometimes the lines are crazy, while other times there aren't many people so call in your order ahead of time if possible!"
642,"OMG.  Po'Boys delivered as promised.  Wicked delicious Louisiana-style sandwiches that are packed with flavor and freshness.  I had the roast beef, Tracey had the pulled pork, and our son had the cheeseburger.  We got fries and fried pickles, too.  I can't wait to go back - and lucky us - we're only about 5 minutes away!"
643,"THE best sweet potato fries I have ever had. I also had the fried pickles, shrimp po boy, and my partner had the blackened shrimp sandwich. Altogether we were very happy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The bathroom is unisex. Lots of seating at nice tables. Five stars for flavor!!"
644,"The food is fantastic, But the price is very sky high for a sandwich. The workers are nice to everyone so that's a plus. Give this place a try and form your own opinion."
645,My favorite two sandwiches in Portland are from Po Boys: the Blackened Fish and the Ray Nagen. Delicious!
646,"We were visiting Portland for the weekend from out of state and are so glad we tried this place. I got the blackened fish sandwich and my husband got the peacemaker, both were delicious! My blackened fish sandwich was unlike anything I've tried before! We also got the fried pickles which were finger lickin good. The people there were also friendly and welcoming, it was overall a great experience and will definitely go back if we are ever in Portland again!"
647,"My first experience here was fairly disappointing. After I read all the reviews, I was very pumped to try the ""Debris"" po'boy. Man, it was the driest roast beef I ever had. I didn't even know roast beef can be this dry. The sandwich was hard to eat and I didn't get all the fuss with the other reviews. 
Then one other night several months later I decided to give this place another try. This time I had the pulled pork and fried pickles. Okay..... much better! I'm salivating now writing this. The pork redeemed the place! I also indulged myself with their coconut macaroon and yep, it was fantastic!
Still giving 4 stars, since that first sandwich was shockingly disappointing."
648,Freakin fantastic sandwiches. Great friendly service too. A little off the Portland main drag but worth it!
649,"This place has it all delicious sandwiches, tasty milkshakes and cookies! What more could a guy need? 


Their counter staff is super friendly!"
650,"Ordered PBP for delivery a little while ago. Was my first time trying it after hearing a few co-workers rave about them and now I know why. Had their Cajun fries and a chicken sandwich that was more than perfectly seasoned. Next time around, I'd love to eat at PBP and experience the restaurant first hand."
651,"This has to be one of the best sandwiches I ever ate in my life. What you think I haven't had a sandwich before... WRONG I've had millions and this one here ranks right at the top few. Mmm first time here and definitely will be back a lot. The sandwich I had was the blackened fish which took about 15 minutes to arrive to my table. I was salivating from the good smell in there. Perfect piece of fish tasted so fresh and that bread wow so soft and yet so crisp the slaw is great and the red pepper mayo adds a touch of sweetness add a little authentic Louisiana hot sauce and you are in nirvana.  The Cajun fries were really good as well heavily seasoned as I like. 
Overall 5 stars for service and 6 stars for the sandwich!!!"
652,"I just can't believe it Portland! I just can't believe it... I'm handing out frigging five star ratings like there candy out in this bitch! 

This salty ass pickle place is phenomenal. I was (once again) blown away. Great price, great atmosphere, unique menu, awesome foods like... seriously- what place sucks out here in Portland!"
653,"I know I'm a bit late to the party, but this place is delicious! Despite having lived here for three years, I never visited Po'Boys & Pickles until now. What was I thinking??? It's a nice casual restaurant with wood floors and tables and walls covered in Mardi Gras and New Orleans paraphernalia. I had the blackened fish sandwich and it was really good. The fish was flaky and tasty and nicely seasoned. It's definitely the best po'boy I've had outside of New Orleans. My wife had the muffaletta, which she really enjoyed. We also split a chocolate milk shake that was not too sweet or thick. I appreciated not feeling like I was going to burst a blood vessel in my head while sucking it out of a straw. Not much more to say here. Po'Boys & Pickles is great! I look forward to coming back!"
654,"So I had gone to the Allagash Brewing Company, drank a ton of free beer, and was looking for a hearty lunch to soak up some of the booze. I checked Yelp (of course) and the nearest highly rated place to come up was Po' Boys. You can't go wrong with a universal four and a half star rating, and the reviewers were right. This place was great! They had sandwich offerings for carnivores, vegetarians, and the classic fried shrimp po' boy that my friend and I both ordered along with hand-cut, lightly salted fries and a couple cans of beer. 

You order at the counter, give your name, and then someone from the kitchen brings out your food. The Po' boys were perfect. The shrimp was fried, but not greasy, cooked through, but tender. Not rubbery. The sandwich was on soft-baked, fresh bread with juicy tomato, lettuce and just the right amount of mayo. The fries were perfectly salted and not greasy either. It was a really good, filling lunch."
655,"This was my third time coming to Po Boys for lunch and I absolutely love their sandwiches and sweet potato fries. If you are a student at UNE like I am, this is such a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner for late night studying in the library. 
I ordered pulled regular sized pork sanwich with sweet potato fries and I felt that the portion was really big for its cost. The barbecue sauce was the right amount on the sanwich and although it became messy when i was eating it, it was  still amazing! This place is only 3 blocks away from starbucks so I usually like to grab coffee after eating before heading to class. This place is affordable, convenient and has good food :)"
656,"The wait is interminable! Long line at the counter, over 30 minutes to get two half sandwiches and some fries. And this was 1:30 on a Sunday. Just kids working the kitchen with no obvious sense of direction. Food was good but not worth the wait."
657,"The beginning of this review takes place not at Po Boys, but at the legendary Fisherman's Grill down the street.  So there I was, standing in front of FG at noon, waiting for it to open.  Outside, a pregnant woman paced angrily back and forth.  Her husband, wary, kept pushing his face against the glass, peering inside looking for signs of life.  3 other families sat around waiting patiently, then 6 Asians with cameras around their necks showed up.  It is 15 minutes past the appointed opening time and you could cut the tension in the air with a knife.  A chef walks out and begs for patience, says it will be at least 15 more minutes before they can open.  Hands fly up into the air, sighs exhaled... it was at this point I decided this was too much negative energy to endure for a lobster roll.

This, is where Po Boys entered to save the day.  There was nowhere near as much angst to be found, and everyone seemed generally more content about life.  My golden fried shrimp sandwich was amazing, as was the coconut macaroon I had for dessert after.  I'm pretty sure pandemonium was still building over at FGs, but I was out the door, happily filled, and on my way again.

Sanity. Saved."
658,"Came in new to the neighborhood, decided to check this place out because of its great reviews. Very great experience coming here. First of all, the location is not bad it is near a gas station, car wash, McDonald's and a little more down the street. 

Has plenty of parking for guests and has a very nice seating area outside. Coming into the joint there is a nice atmosphere with music and a television. They do accept cards and cash. 

Now to the good part, sandwiches sound terrific but are on the pricier side..... if you're going to get a large, get it ! Eat the other half later because it's that good. Today I got the fried chicken cutlet which is topped off with honey mustard, chicken, lettuce mayo and bacon. LOVED IT.,now the next thing I'm gonna try to get is the blackened fish because it's the most talked about. 

Service is well done and I am definitely coming to try the other sandwiches! Not sure if they have restrooms!"
659,"Thrilling and legit!  Passing through after visiting family, grateful that Yelp reviews save the day again.  Off our path, but worth it:

I'm the child of a father born and raised in Northern Maine and a mother born and raised in New Orleans.  After a 2-week visit in Millinocket, the family needed dinner on the way back down to Cleveland.  Reviews were excellent, but husband and I were concerned we were eating outside NOLA.  ""You'll be disappointed in the bread,"" husband said as he tried to urge a different pick.  I made the executive decision based on reviews and kids' hunger level.

I have two words for you:  LEIDENHEIMER BAKERY.  This is the deal-breaker loaf for all legit po' boys, and is why they're such a challenge outside the city.  There's just something in the water.  But when I inquired, the proprietor very graciously informed me that they order their loaves direct from Leidie's...I was over the moon!

We got the Debris (read: roast beef with gravy, dressed) and the Peacemaker (mixed fried oyster and shrimp).  WELL DONE.  The breading was light and well seasoned, but didn't fall off.  Just the right proportion of being dressed.

We'll definitely be back on our next trip through to Northern Maine...sure beats a plane ticket to Parkway Bakery or Magazine Street Po' Boys!!

Superb.  Congratulations!"
660,"I love this place for a good sandwich, however, the wait time is too long. Nonetheless, their sweet potatoes is very good not too sweet and their sandwiches are good."
661,"Have had a few meals from here they never disappoint, just had delivery pulled pork and potatoes and it arrived looking like a nightmare but tasted like a dream. Wouldn't hold it against them, food was amazing. This is a major player in Portland food!"
662,"Two words: blackened fish. I'm obsessed with this sandwich! (Great on salad too!) The fish is always cooked well and seasoned beautifully! 

This was one of the first places I tried when moving to Portland, and I still eat here regularly. They are consistent, delicious, friendly and have enough variety that I'm never bored (yes, I occasionally get something other than the blackened fish. The oysters and shrimp are good too!) The sweet potato fries are devine, and a side is plenty big to share. The regular fries are not the best, so I always get sweets.

Their shakes and cookies are great too - which I didn't expect at first, but was pleasantly pleased!

Small parking lot, but there's usually a spot or two open. Certainly worth the trip up Forrest for these goodies!"
663,"I really love the food these guys put out but if you really want to experience the food properly eat in, the takeout just doesn't seem to travel well. The golden fried oysters are the best!"
664,"Louisiana style comfort food, great for sweatpants and Netflix.  Definitely in my top three take out spots in Portland.  My favorite sandwiches:

1.) peacemaker
2.) blackened fish
3.) fried chicken cutlet 

My favorite salads:

1.) falafel salad
2.) roasted vegetable 

Salads are good sized.  My wife and I usually get a sandwich each and split a salad for a full and satisfying dinner.

Additionally:

1.) I just had the wings for the first time....primo!  I got the Cajun honey style.  

2.) the coconut macaroons are 

I've always had a good experience picking up food here.  It's usually 15-20 minutes after calling."
665,"I was in Portland visiting family and thought I'd treat my father to lunch.  I ordered a shrimp po' boy and my wife had a burger.  Both were delicious and we'd get them again. Here is my issue with this place and I don't feel it was handled well. My father wanted red beans and rice with just an order of shrimp on the side. An employee came to the table and said he made a mistake, they can't do a side of shrimp but can put it on bread or a salad. This didn't make sense to me but I said just put it on the bread and we'll just pick it off. A few minutes later, another employee came over and said that because of the error, we owed an additional $3.00 

Really?? They bugged us two times because we asked for a side order of shrimp.  We actually threw out the bread, which they made us get and since they made the mistake why would you come to a customers table to ask for $3.00?

I really wanted to like this place but don't think I'll go back. Not sure it was worth the money we paid and just a word of advise to the staff. Customer service!!! If a person wants something that you make all day long as a side, just friggin give it to them."
666,"My friends and I were looking for something quick and delicious. This place delivered a great, relatively cheap fish sandwich-- very well seasoned/flavorful. The large sandwich was great to share between two people. The establishment itself is not much to look at, but because we like their New Orleans style food we wiĺl almost certainly be back."
667,"Will definitely be going back to eat here soon! I was introduced to this place by my coworkers and it did not disappoint. I got the Ray Nagin and a Thai tea shake. The sandwich is turkey, slaw and cheese all grilled to perfection on rye bread. Their bread is the star because it was warm and crisp on the outside and then soft and fluffy on the inside. The sandwich itself was good with a good amount of flavor and crunch from the slaw. Being a novice, I did not know about how to condiment my sandwich but they offer hot sauce and other add ons to make the sandwich sing to your flavor profiles. 

The Thai tea shake was okay. The tea flavor was too subtle for my taste and the texture was a little grainy. That being said, I will definitely come back and try them again and scope out those gravy fries! In terms of pros and cons... Pro: off street parking... Con: located off the busy part of Forest Ave. Pro: sandwiches are fairly priced ranging from $6-12 depending on type and size. Regular is a decent size and the fillings are ample! Con: shake was a bit pricy considering what I got. 4.95 for small and I think large was 6.95. 

This place is worth a try if you are in the area but try to schedule it before or after the lunch rush or be prepared to wait."
668,"Everyone in my party raved about what they ordered, from the Angry pig to the Peacemaker to the Blackened Fish. The bread comes direct from New Orleans and is wonderful. Be sure to try the fried pickles! Crispy deliciousness with spicy mayo!"
669,"Great place for good fast food and they have a variety of brews. Food was great, service was even better."
670,"Sweet baby Jesus. My fiancé and I were just driving looking for somewhere to eat lunch and stopped here on a whim. We stopped in around 2:30pm on a Monday, no lines, we ordered a surf and turf po'boy, a blt po'boy, and an order of cajun honey wings. Everything was delicious, like, if I lived in Maine, I would apply for a second job here just to ensure that I could eat here every day. It was that real. And please, please try the roasted red pepper mayo. I love mayo, copious amounts of it and on everything, but this mayo was a game changer."
671,Me  and my cock worker went for lunch and both got the full or large sandwich (a normal sandwich the regular is just a half sandwich) so 14 dollars and change each and it's the smallest sandwich I have ever seen dry with no condiments on it as advertised on eather of our sandwiches my advice is save your money and go across the street to Susan's fish and chips!
672,"Used my PDA card (Portland Dine Around) and this was our first visit to Po' Boys & Pickles. Got there on a Saturday afternoon and the parking lot was packed, but street parking was easy. The crew at the counter to order, were on the ball and knowledgable. 
i think they probably do a lot of take-out, but many of the seats were filled with dine-in people. They have a good menu and interesting shakes, like Key Lime Pie and Chai or Thai Tea. Our sandwiches were good and the fries were some of the best I'd had, reasonably priced too.
The big problem was that the place was grubby and needed a good scrubbing. in particular, just at our table the salt and pepper shakers were grimy and sticky with a BBQ sauce residue.
Getting  a cleaning crew in with a fresh eye to eliminate clutter and steam clean the joint would be a vast improvement."
673,"Great food, longest wait I have ever had in Portland for food. Don't trust their estimates for pickup over the phone. I have consistently been told 20 minutes and it's actually 30 minutes. 

Again, GREAT food, slowest cooking ever."
674,"First off, I LOVE THE FOOD! But, there is a huge issue with takeout orders. You call in and place a takeout order, they tell you 10-15 minutes. You get there in 12 and then sit in line for 15. Foods great but when will you wake up to the fact you need a takeout line??!!?? I'd come way more often if you fixed this issue. Keep your one register. Person comes in who ordered takeout, they get in the takeout line and after the cashier is done with the next ""dine in"" customer they can ask the takeout customer their name. Booooom problem solved. Also, I'd tip way more. Because after sitting in line for no reason, I get a little irritable."
675,"This afternoon I decided to go to Po'Boys and Pickles. In the past I have tried to stop by here for lunch many times before but due to lack of parking I decided to go to some place else. Today, however I was very lucky as I drove by to find a parking spot on the street right next to the restaurant. I was delighted and knew exactly what I was going to order, the Cheeseburger Po'Boy. I had it the last time and remembered it fondly. I also ordered two orders of sweet potato fries. Although I could eat both orders, I wasn't planning on that this day. I was bringing an order to a friend of mine, who I remembered loved them as much as I did. The cheeseburger was one of a kind. It doesn't come with a traditional roll, but with a soft sub roll that truly adds to the flavor of the experience. I ordered my sandwich with all the fixings except the onion. It came with lettuce, tomato and a delicate combination of mustard, ketchup and mayo. The sweet potato fries were large in portions and crispy. They were an excellent complement to my sandwich. I really have a troubling dilemma the next time I stop by, which will most definitely be soon. Do I stick with the Po'Boy Cheeseburger or try a different sandwich? Does anyone out there in  Yelp-World offer a suggestion?"
676,"This place is a solid go-to in PWM for NOLA comfort food and ambience. I had the blackened fish po'boy with an added fried egg, hot sauce,and lots of pickles -- an exceptional sandwich for $8. The fried pickles with special sauce was an added bonus.

I have been to NOLA twice and this place is a perfect way to feed your NOLA jones and also great for quick family meals out.

Would love to see an updated draft line-up with a Bissell or Foundation on pour."
677,"3 stars is being generous for this Monday night visit. Ordered at 6:18. Got my simple order of a sandwich and fries at 6:48. For $18 I expect at least a little service. This is second time this has happened recently and I'm done going here. Not worth the aggravation. 

I've heard there is a new owner.  He/she needs to rededicate this place to actually serving customers in a timely manner."
678,"The Sultans of Sandwich serve Creole. Oyster Po'boy as good as it gets. French fries with gravy. What a treat on a cold, dark night. The sandwich rolls were super light and fresh."
679,"I have no idea why it has taken me so long to try this place (probably because it's off the beaten path?) but I'm so glad I did! I honestly didn't expect all that much because, too be honest, I don't think I've ever had that great of a po' boy until today. I had the blackened fish which was cooked to perfection and you could tell they used quality fresh bread for the loaf. I am so mad I didn't get some fried pickles but I did snag a few bites of my boyfriends fried shrimp which was amazing as well! It's a smaller place but you can easily get it to go or go on the patio during warmer weather. They had a bunch of options including milkshakes and even some good looking salads if you're not into fried food. Decent prices for a good sized portion too!"
680,"I can honestly say...this is the best sub shop in Portland and rivals any in the US...it's that good....the food is original...with top end ingredients...

My favs....

Dirty Bird add bacon and a fried egg

Muffaletta

Big Chef

Love everything on the menu..."
681,"I really, really, really wanted to enjoy this place but after waiting an HOUR for one sandwich I have to say I was disappointed.  The food was good but not nearly good enough to offset an outrageous wait.  The restaurant was not even particularly busy."
682,"Po'Boys and pickles may have the best french fries in Portland, and that includes sweet potato fries as well!  
I had all but stopped ordering sweet potato fries as they have become ubiquitous and uniformly tasteless until I happened to grab one from a friend's order at Po' Boys.  There is something about their oil, or maybe fry time, maybe it's the way they cut them, or maybe the kind of potato they use??  
Whatever it is, these are some stellar fries, and the rest of the food is pretty great as well!  I used to be a regular shrimp Po'Boy customer until I tried the blackened fish sandwich with coleslaw and now that's all I order, it is THAT good!
Po'Boys is a place dedicated to quality ingredients and putting a whole lot of love and juju into their food.  Truly anything i've ever had here has been great.
Pro tip:  Don't pass up their coconut macaroon cookies.  While they may look like no big deal sitting in that case on the counter, they are legendary and might possibly change the way you think about macaroons!"
683,"A nice find, near Portland but without the parking worries.  We ordered the fried shrimp po' boy and the fried oyster po' boy sandwiches.  On impulse, I ordered a coconut macaroon as well.  Our sandwich, both regular size (instead of large), were full of fried shrimp or oysters on fresh bread.  Both were delicious and just the right size.  The sandwich, on a baguette, was six or seven inches long and packed with the star ingredient.  I can't imagine how large the large must have been. These delightful fried morsels are also available in baskets with fries or in salads.  The macaroon was a good choice, with all the buttery, sweet nuances a macaroon should have.  My only issue was that it took a half an hour for the order to be ready.  It really wasn't a problem for us, but for someone with a limited lunchtime it might be. I'd call in the order if time is of the essence.

There are several types of po' boys including a cheeseburger and a roast beef on offer.  My husband would find the shake menu very appealing because it includes Thai tea and salted caramel flavors.  (Sorry you missed it, honey!)  Next time, I'd like to try the muffalata sandwich, the boudin and the toffee pudding.  Already fantasizing about my next visit.  Wish I lived closer!"
684,"While it may not be as good as an authentic Po' Boy right from New Orleans, this is easily the best and closest you will get anywhere in New England. I love New Orleans and I am in love with Po' Boys. I have been to many different restaurants claiming to make them, and they all disappoint. But here, they make really, really good Po' Boys. I come here often and recommend it to all of my friends. The crunchy French bread, the big portions, the options and flavors; it really is worth trying and coming to over and over again."
685,"I ordered the blacked fish po' boy and the boudin balls.

Honestly, the blacked fish sandwich is what dreams are made of. Seriously, I think I should put out a warning or caution statement about this sandwich. If you eat this sandwich, you won't be able to stop thinking about it. 

The boudin balls were pretty good. I had never even heard of them before, but I needed to try them since I love pâté. They were a crispy fried ball of rice and liver pâté. I'm more of a country pâté kind of girl so I didn't fall in love with these as they were more heavy on the irony/livery funky side as far as pâté goes. However, the mustard dipping sauce pairs with them perfectly (and this is coming from someone who hates mustard!) - I would advise only trying the boudin balls if you already like liver/pâté."
686,"I went here on a Wednesday mid-afternoon.  It was still steady with business. Ordering a fried chicken cutlet sandwich and sweet potato fries, I chose a table and the food was delivered very quickly.  The sandwich was delicious.  I got the large so I have half for later.  The bread was nice and crunchy/crispy on the outside and soft inside, very good.  The sweet potato fries were excellent.  Prices for the fries were a little high IMO. Overall a great place, very good food and quick service.  I will return again."
687,"Our group shared several Po Boys. The Debris, blackened fish sandwich, and the shrimp po boy. All of the sandwiches were fresh, flavorful and absolutely DELICIOUS!! We also got fried pickles and sweet potato fries. Both were fresh, hot and not greasy!!
I highly recommend eating here, the food is fabulous and very, very reasonably priced!! 
Also the staff is very helpful, and welcoming.
I can't wait to go back very soon!!!!"
688,"Po' Boys is a great sandwich shop at a convenient location outside of downtown Portland.  The staff is always friendly and in a fantastic mood, which makes this place even better to come to.  The Louisiana-style sandwich shop has many different sandwiches to fulfill your hunger.  A 6-inch sandwich will probably set you back $6-$8, but it's loaded with great food and amazing taste.  I've tried many of their sandwiches and haven't come across a bad one.  Plus, Po' Boys and Pickles offers fantastic Cajan fries ($3.25), Gumbo ($5.95), and a Coconut Macaroon that is to die for!  The Coconut Macaroon is the ultimate combination of sweet and buttery.  And at only $1, you can't go wrong.

The place is decked out in New Orleans-themed decorations, with my favorite being the New Orleans Saints Super Bowl Champs front page newspaper article.  This place also features Crystal Hot Sauce.  For those of you who don't know, Crystal is a fantastic hot sauce and rare treat usually only found in Louisiana.  It gives any Cajan-style food an extra, authentic kick!

I've never heard a bad review about this place out of anyone I've talked to.  I highly recommend giving this place a shot.  You won't regret it."
689,"Went to try it out. Waited 35 minutes for sandwiches. It was busy but not that busy. Gordon Ramsey needs to pay a visit. Food was OK, bread was very good. If you want a ok lunch then plan to take the hour break"
690,"New Orleans comes to Maine.  

Shrimp Salad and 2 Miller Lites @$17. Awesome. 

Cool place. Cool atmosphere. Not much to say. 

Friendly and delicious!"
691,This place looks like a hole-in-the-wall but the food was amazing! Also - make sure to try their macaroons. I would drive back to NH just for their coconut macaroons! They were amazing. I ma giving this 4 stars as the place could use a renovation.
692,"It was the day before Christmas 2013. My husband and I were spending the day around town with my dad. We were taking their suggestions on where to eat that day. (his breakfast recommendation of ""the egg and I"" had gone over quite well.) 

He had suggested this place many times before, but we had always gone to some of our other favourite places first. This time, we listened. Much like his recommendation of El Rayo Taco, dad once again named a divine pearl. The space is kinda small, but in a cozy way. It has two unisex bathrooms and the soda machine is out to provide FREE refills while you eat. The staff are indeed friendly and our food was actually brought to our table by the lady who was at the register when we ordered.

My regular sized fried shrimp Po' Boy was magnificent!! Soft bread, light tartar sauce that tasted scratch made, loaded for bear with shrimp that was breaded and fried perfectly, and using shrimp so fresh that the pallet sings.

(No, I'm not exaggerating. I'm a writer and a foodie.)

My husband will have to review his, because with a portion like this, I was filled to perfection with my own. We three did share an order of gravy fries, which we all agreed were much saltier than expected...tasty, but too salty.

This has made the favorites list for the next summer visit!"
693,Had a great lunch here today with Jason! I had the Cajun fish sandwich with Cajun fries and prickly pear San pallegrino soda!!! Food was prepared quickly and delivered to our table outside by a fantastic person!!!! Thank you for the great food at a decent price.
694,Nothing like it in Portland. From the chicken cutlet to the turtle pie shake. I leave Po boys satisfied every single time.
695,"Delicious!!! I'm always weary to try southern style dishes in other states however I was throughly surprised. Everything was flavorful,authentic, and reasonable priced. Highly recommended."
696,"Stayed at a hotel for the night and decided to get take out from Po' Boys & Pickles. So glad we did! 

My husband and I shared the roasted veggie salad and the basket of fried shrimp. Also got fries and a side of the gravy. The roasted veggie salad was soo good, really hit the spot. Lots of brussels sprouts, goat cheese, and maybe butternut squash? Really good! The shrimp were nice and crispy, and yes, the gravy was salty, but good. Really enjoyed it, thanks!"
697,"I eat here way too much.  I mean, I try to eat lunch at other places around town, but one way or another I usually end up here.  

Things I love: 

- The food, obviously.  I've probably tried 10% of their menu, and I want to try 95% of it.  Take this as a HUGE compliment because I can't say that about any other menu in town.  Ordering takes me forever because it ALL looks good; this is also unusual because I take a very quick and decisive 'seek and destroy' approach to ordering from menus.  I want to explore all the little sides.  I'm talking to you, red  beans and rice (next time) and gumbo (maybe next time also).   I always make the mistake of throwing on a side to a medium sandwich, and they both together end up being way more than I can tackle.  The basket sides are so big, you guys.  You wouldn't think, at $4/ side.  My only regret is not coming here during dinner, when I can handle a bigger, deep fried meal.  All the menu options feel like dinners wearing a lunch beard.

- I love the New Orleans divey vibe this place has, with music posters, beads dangling from the ceiling, and other odds and ends all over the place that you can examine while you're waiting for your order to come up.  I've spent some time in New Orleans and you actually start getting suspicious if a place with good food ISN'T divey.  I'd rather eat here than in New Orleans any day - they have NOT ONCE asked me to do anything to earn beads, and I have a lesser chance of contracting hepatitis (if you've spent more than 2 minutes on Bourbon Street then you'll understand this).

- I love the location.  It seems like Morrill's corner is experiencing a culinary Renaissance, with Susan's Fish N Chips across the street and a few other good places to eat in the area, too.  Keep it up, Morrill.  

- I love the service.  I'm always greeted with a smile by the same counter staff person.  She's great.  It can take 5-10 minutes for my order to come up, but I'm totally fine with that.

-  I love the fact it's next to Goodwill.  I can usually combine my love of spicy cajun food with my love of thrift.  

- I love that they have $2.50 pints on Mondays and Tuesdays.  This is turning into a great place to hang out with friends, especially now that I've discovered there were picnic tables outside underneath the mounds of snow this whole time.  

Take the drive ALL THE WAY DOWN Forest Avenue and experience some great cajun food.  But come for dinner on an empty stomach."
698,love po boys have the best sandwich and are very quick to make them. Cold beer and good deals during the week.
699,"Easily one of my top 10 favorite sandwich shops in all of the US; the fries are great, the wings are just how I like, they really have a great selection of food in general. This place is usually absolutely slammed - but well worth the wait."
700,"Yet another neighborhood spot that I'm KICKING myself for taking so long to try. It's one of those places that has been on my list forever, that I drive by every single day, but somehow always forgot it as an option when deciding where to eat. 
This Sunday though, I knew I wanted to go to a late brunch somewhere nearby and decided to check if Woodford f&b did brunch- and they sure do! 
From the moment I walked in I was in love. The design is reminiscent of some of my other all time favorite places in Portland (Rose Foods and HiFi donuts) in that it's the perfect mix between vintage and clean, sleek modern elements. I love the booths, giant windows, beautiful wooden ceilings and the white ceramic deer heads (plus the cool golden deer heads at the bar). The environment was so welcoming and truly visually pleasing. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait, really felt like this is a place where locals just stroll in for good quality food and drink without the fuss of going downtown. 

The menu had a brunch prix fixe option for $22, which included bottomless coffee, a cocktail and a brunch entree. We jumped at this option and for the cocktails ended up unanimously choosing the Harvey Wallbanger which was SO good... and slightly dangerous because it tastes more of orange juice than vodka, which meant I had the challenge of remembering to pace myself.
We got the biscuits and sausage gravy, eggs Florentine and the dulce de leche bread pudding French toast. Every single bite of the very generous portion was pure heaven. The biscuits were light, fluffy and absolutely doused with a creamy gravy containing chunks of salty sausage and two sunny side up eggs. Breaking the yolks of those eggs and mixing that in with gravy was incredible. The eggs Florentine was also extremely creamy with a bechamel sauce that married the spinach and poached eggs in a glorious way. When you pair that with the soft focaccia bread that accompanied it- well let's just say there was nothing left to take home. 
To top all of this off was the French toast. Whatever you do, you HAVE to get this. It was both soft and crunchy with toppings like nuts, seeds and raisins that made it feel like it was just as good for your body as it was for your soul. With our food also came a couple bowls of fruit containing pineapple, grapefruit, blood orange and grapes- which added a nice fresh and healthy element to the meal, and made us feel less guilty indulging ourselves. 
My new mission, after having such a wonderful experience, is to become a regular who knows the waitstaff by name and they know mjne. With this being such a cozy neighborhood spot, I don't think I'll have any problems accomplishing this."
701,"Just a short stroll down the street from my apartment lies Woodford F & B.  
It was my partners birthday dinner and we went early because as a baker bedtime is quite early.
The space looked good, like some kind of futuristic diner.  The tables were clean and the booth we were seated at was comfortable.  Ordered the housemade apple cider and thyme soda - really good.
Dinner  oysters Rockefeller as an ap, the burger for me and steak and fries for the significant other.

The burger.  Not cooked to my requested medium rare but that is the way it goes... always.  Weirdly a bit burnt on the bottom.  The pickles were too much with the grilled onions bacon and cheese.  Too much sweet and vinegar with the char on the bottom.  The fries were crispy and thin... but who can eat two whole potatoes worth in one sitting?  

The other... steak and fries... ordered cooked medium and came out rare.   So tough it was like chewing gum.  I tried some but gave up on swallowing it.  Too bad that plate cost 24$.  At least the were enough fries to make a meal out of that.

All things considered, even if it's a short walk from my apartment I won't be back unless someone else is buying... well... probably not even then.

The short story... not worth my hard earned money or time.  The service was prompt but whatever."
702,"I've become one of these Portland townies that rarely leaves the peninsula unless I need to. I have a car, I just rarely venture past the Hannaford by the boulevard except for monthly Great Lost Bear cravings.

So, it had been probably at least 6 months since I had been to Woodford F&B. I know the food is great if not a little pricey for the location, but the only thing I can ever remember about the menu is the burger. It's a damn good burger, but it is rich even on the burger spectrum and sometimes I don't want to feel over-full for 3-4 hours. Some errand brought us out this way (okay, maybe the errand was just going to Allagash but I digress), and my girlfriend was pushing hard for a lunch stop at WF&B. We did a drive-by to see there were bar seats open and then utilized the parking over at the Woodfords Club.

It's a Sunday. I'm kind of feeling like I could house that burger and then just lay somewhere all day, or maybe something else equally rich, of which there were a plethora of options. Then some voice that's rarely heard guided me to their cobb salad. A cobb salad typically doesn't generate too much excitement at least if you picture the garden variety (pun not intended), but this one is something else. First awesome thing: Smoked ham AND bacon, along with avocado. You still get the hard boiled egg, tomato, and some scallion and ""young greens"". I could honestly not tell you the difference between young greens and middle-aged greens, but this was a professional salad. An underrated component is when they actually toss the greens in the dressing before adding the rest and serving. Every bite has their buttermilk blue cheese in it, but it's also not overwhelming. Posting a photo, and I think it's one pretty looking salad. 

I guess the point is that we visit WF&B so infrequently that I forgot they can take something as simple as a cobb salad and make it into beautiful and super satisfying meal."
703,"I don't post five star reviews based on a first experience, but this time I am sorely tempted.

On a whim I invited my dad out for dinner and there was absolutely no parking at our first choice so having never been here, we both decided to try this place. Yelp has this Mark is three dollar signs for a reason! The cocktail I got was $15 on its own! So if you're going here the idea has to be that you want to treat yourself!

Dad got the mussels and Fries while I got the tri-tip steak and fries. We started by sharing the caramelized onion dip which was divine! It comes with house-made rosemary potato chips and they're certainly more dip than chip. However, having noticed we finished the chips, the waitress offered to have more brought out for free! More chips were brought and the dip was finished I actually use my finger to clean the bowl!

My dad simply loved the mussels and fries going so far as to ask for a second piece of bread to help soak up the liquor at the bottom of the dish before giving it a good Italian slurp! My tri-tip steak and fries we're very respectable. The waitress asked how I would like the steak and I told her medium rare, however the steak ended up medium well. A minor thing and not worth having a fit over, so I simply informed her so that they could know it's something to be aware of. I didn't ask for anything in compensation or a replacement meal, the waitress did offer though.

The unsweetened iced tea my dad had was given a free refill, though I don't know if that's policy or simply our experience. I only had the one cocktail but it was delicious and delightful. In the end I was offered something small on the house as an apology for the steak being inadvertently overcooked. I brought something home for my husband to try since he was babysitting while I was out.

High marks to the waitress for being polite and on top of her tables as well as high marks to the restaurant in general for quality food and being well-managed."
704,"There's a bunch of beverages on the menu, so that second part of their name is totally spot on. That said, I don't drink alcohol so my options were the usual fare: housemade soda, Maine root soda, coffee, and tea. If you want to know if their alcohol beverage menu is good, you'll have to find a different review!

So let's get down to brass tacks: the food of Woodford Food & Beverage is simply good. I love when a menu is uncomplicated, with choices for all types of eaters but not so overwhelming you drown in the sea of options (a la The Cheesecake Factory). Woodford has options but not too many. It's well prepared and delicious.

Let's start with the Croque Madame! Get it. The béchamel sauce is decadent and there's a whole slice of ham steak in there--no weak deli meat for WF&B. Sunny side egg of perfection added creamy bliss to each bite. Side of herbed dressing covered greens was fine, but nothing overly special.

The burger though. The BURGER. What makes a great burger? Every single damn thing in and on the WF&B' burger. What is that cheese blend?! The brisket and ground beef blend of the beef patty is tender, juicy, and absolute heaven with every mouthful. The bun is awesome. Homemade pickle, fabulous! Each bite of the burger will send you into meat heaven. I have never had such a tender burger and I can't imagine the experience will ever be topped. 

For dessert, we ordered the lemon blueberry panna cotta. The lemon curd was just too overpowering. I mean, I love me some lemon curd in a big way but it masks the perfect vanilla panna cotta beneath. I wish it had been undressed--simple can be better. I would love to try many many of the listed desserts--there were so many delicious options. 

So, in summary, dinner at Woodford F&B is a definite win. They make simple things with deep care and appreciation for flavor. This is a must visit in Portland cuisine culture."
705,"I found it interesting that this place advertises ""Kid Friendly."" It doesn't feel very kid friendly on the inside, more like a pricy bar with a limited menu. However, the screaming child behind me made me realize that yes, the advertising did work (unfortunately for me). 

I came in only because Woodfords was legit attached to the laundromat I was impatiently waiting at. I can't speak on the food, because I'm picky and it was a very limited menu, however, the bartender was very friendly and kept my cup full. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. I would be back again, but only to kill some time."
706,"Overall: good food in a quaint diner. 
Food: their burger is phenomenal. Maybe the best burger I've ever had. Eggs and purgatory burdened on too spicy for the entire dish but the first few bites were pleasant. Just needed something to round that flavor out so it wasn't just spicy. It's a traditional menu that I feel could use a few modern twists but it's good food and you know what you're getting."
707,"I went here for brunch and do want to point out that we had a large group of 11. 

First off, the place looks great. There was obviously a lot of attention to the decor and aesthetic of this place. 

I wanted to like this place more though. First off, the coffee was pretty bad. In Portland, that's home to such a great coffee scene, I wish there was more attention to the quality and taste. 

Overall the food was decent, not blown away but very creative dishes and lots of food selection. We ordered some oysters, brussel sprouts, a delicious bread pudding, and other more brunch oriented fare. 

My one gripe of this place was that the eggs Florentine were way over done. The eggs were supposed to be poached and they were served with basically hard boiled yolks. The other eggs were okay and runny as expected. 

I would still check out this place and maybe even go back for dinner. The tap list looked great and cocktails seemed tasty. Service was great and they even split up the check for our party. Small details make this place a 4 or 5 star but still a solid spot."
708,"I have yet to be blown away here. Each time I've gone the food was just okay... at best and for their prices you'd hope for... more flavor, consistency, food to plate ratio, etc. The first time was their opening night, which I never really do, because I know it's not a true indicator of what places are capable of. So I was very forgiving and kept expectations really low. The next time we went was about 6 months later and it validated my first experience. I went one more time after that, because third times a charm right? Wrong... it was actually worse than the first two. Seems as though they are trying to have the hippest, latest, trendiest menu- but spend little time perfecting their craft. Unfortunately, I live down the street and it's never my go to... no matter how convenient."
709,"It was a good burger, but it wasn't $20.00 good--I actually enjoyed their fries a lot more than the burger. Their menu wasn't particularly unique, but the location is great and the inside is beautiful!"
710,"Me and my boyfriend came here on a date, this place is within walking distance to our house! We walked in and the dim lighted atmosphere felt very comfortable. A hostess immediately greeted us and brought us to a booth by the window. Everything on the menu looked amazing, and our waiter was wonderful. He explained the specials for the night and took our drink orders. They were made strong and tasted great. I ordered the swordfish, this was the first time I have ever eaten this. We also ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, they were seasoned perfectly and lighted fried leaving them crispy. The food came out a reasonable amount of time, and the swordfish was one of the best things I have ever eaten. It melted in my mouth and paired well with the rice. It was pricey, but worth every cent for the experience and the food. We will return."
711,"Sunday brunch was excellent. We sat at the bar and was greeted by a very pleasant gentleman. He told us about the specials and looked eager to mix up a drink. So the bloody Mary it was for me. Hands down the best I've had. The rim was dusted with a nice peppery blend and the garnishes topped it off nicely. My boyfriend had a whiskey & apple cider cocktail. He thought that was excellent too. Even if the food wasn't good I would go back for drinks. But the food was spot on. I had the poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce finished with Parmesan cheese. A side of grilled sourdough for dipping. They offer a fixed price brunch which was excellent $21 for bottomless coffee, brunch cocktail  & brunch entrée."
712,"I love love love me some Woodford F&B. And what's not to love: the food is amazing, the ambiance is perfect and the owners and staff are the best! I always get the Steak and fries or the burger. The burgers been nominated for best of Portland numerous times and it doesn't disappoint! The brisket in it just makes it so amazing. And the FRIES. I love me some fries and they do them perfectly. Always crunchy and always delicious. 

Their cocktails and beer list are great too! I love the emergency margarita. Not too sweet and the chipotle salt rim is the best."
713,"Best piece of swordfish I have ever had in a lemon/mint cream sauce, melted in the mouth. Cocktails were fantastic, but the service was what earns this 5 stars in my book. Very friendly and helpful staff all around"
714,"Been three times; Twice was great and once, not so much. Food and service was mediocre the first time, but glad we gave it another chance and the next two times we were pleased."
715,"This was probably one of the most expensive burgers I've ever had ($18$). It was flavorful but I think the real star of the dish was the French fries. Every fry was crispy and delicious and I would definitely go back for those! However, next time I think I would order the brunch special that comes with unlimited coffee and a brunch cocktail ($21) since it sounds like a better deal."
716,"A fun neighborhood gastro-joint, with a side of bistro thrown in for fun! On this our first visit we stopped in for brunch. I love that they both take reservations and that they open at 10:00 to accommodate the folks that may be more in the mood for breakfast on the weekends.
I will start  by saying that despite the early hour we were warmly greeted and very well served by as friendly a bunch as you could ever meet.  This definitely enhanced the neighborhood vibe. 

We started off with the deviled eggs. They were beautifully presented with delicious bits of bacon on top and so creamy.  I followed this up with a Harvey Wallbanger, that was potent, delicious, and  Is always served with a side of 70's cool.

Since I was in the mood for sweet I then dove in to the Dulce De Leche Bread Pudding French Toast.  As you would imagine  It was a sweet,crunchy, rich cream, fruit, and nut  covered delight! 

My wife on the other hand had the breakfast sandwich and it was awesome! Easily the largest sausage patty served in Portland and an absolutely delicious mix, mostly breakfast with a little bit of chorizo thrown in! Yummy! 
In any case we loved everything and can't wait to go back for dinner."
717,This is such an awesome place. The food is great and the service is even better!  We will be back very soon!
718,"Came here with a group of five and tries almost everything on the menu.  Everyone else has a whiskey cocktail--all were surprisingly sweet which I like and the hit was the oak bitters made by the owner.  I had the Tempranillo which came by the carafe at $40.

We tried the tuna tartare and salmon rillette appetizer specials along with deep fried Brussels--all got rave reviews.  We also shared the kale Caesar like salad and the autumn salad.

as is the case with so many restaurants, the mains were less amazing--we got the swordfish (probably most popular), the pork shank with white beans ( slightly disappointing because not as rich and savory as I was hoping), the veggie grain dish and the roast chicken.  I never order roast chicken, but one of our party doesn't eat beef.  I continue to wonder why one would order roast chicken when you can buy a rotisserie chicken at a wholesale club for $5 that's almost as good.  But the food was still very good even with my quibbles.

For dessert we had the vanilla panna cotta with blueberry/huckleberry compote-delicious!  And the brownie sundae-meh.  Coffee was delicious though!


Ambience is like an upscale diner--fun and casual.  Worth a visit--glad we came."
719,"A relatively new place that's smack dab in the middle of the forest ave/rosemont corner attached to a laundry mat. Although it sounds seedy, it actually is a very classy and tasteful joint where you can get a decent meal. Their menu isn't very extensive which is why I took off some stars because it may be difficult to find something for everyone on there. But from what I've tried it's pretty decent! The place brings a very positive and bright energy which I enjoy! On Sundays they have a great deal for brunch where you can get any brunch and brunch drink for $20!"
720,"Went back for a second try to Woodford F&B to see if my mind could be changed from my previous experience.  My girlfriend and I sat at the bar during happy hour. We had the nicest bartenders, super attentive and helpful. We got two oyster shooters, which were awesome, delicious fries, and a plate of mussels, which were so/so, I wanted more broth and more flavor.

This was a much better experience than my first round... but I'm still not completely sold.  For me, I think the food is expensive and they are trying too hard to be the go-to place in the area.  Like a teenager trying to get in with the ""it"" crowd.  

Would I go back to sit at the bar again for cocktails and tapas, absolutely!! Would I go here for a full on dinner service, probably not."
721,"Woodford's has quickly become quite the hot spot outside of the Old Port. It's a loud, high energy bistro that is a great downtown-ish atmosphere without the hassles. 

It's quite amazing that an attractive upscale bistro opened on such a hectic and wild intersection. There is a small parking lot but it's unclear if it's for the adjacent laundromat or the restaurant. There is ample parking at the Woodford's Club nearby or on side streets. 

The restaurant itself almost feels like a hip diner. The bar was completely full at 5 pm on a Saturday and on a Friday several weeks later. Four top booths line the windows while two tops fill the center of the restaurant. The thick window blinds almost make you forget where you are.

Service was the best aspect of my experience. Our server, who was the twin of Erlich from HBO's Silicon Valley, was exceptional. The menu has a solid variety and has a fixed special of the day. The Quahog Chowder on Thursdays and Braised Lamb Shank on Fridays look the most interesting. The back of the menu is comprised of ten fun cocktails and a variety of beer and wine. It's awesome that the wine is available in three sizes, and the prices are very reasonable.

The prices are not quite as reasonable, however, for the food. The cheeseburger is $16, which may be the highest price in Portland. Again, this a restaurant that is located on one of the worst intersections in the city. Sure, it's an upscale burger made of brisket with bacon and many toppings, but $16??? So, was it worth it? I'll never know, because I ordered it medium rare and it came medium well. The heaping pile of French fries (easily enough for two people) were great. 

The steak and fries ($22) was ordered medium and came well done. It was average, but at least the fries were excellent. The roast half chicken ($21) was well cooked and tasty, but could have used a true side. 

Woodford's has serious potential even in the first couple months. The atmosphere is fun, the drinks are great, the service is perfect and the menu is interesting. The kitchen may have some minor quirks to work out, but this will be a standing-room-only neighborhood joint, and I'll definitely be back."
722,Finally made it here....now wondering what took so long.  Great neighborhood spot with menu items for everybody.  Great food with even better service.
723,"You know how sometimes you just get a good feeling from a person? You can't really put your finger on why, but you just like being around them? That's how I feel about Woodford A&B. 

I visited on a cold January evening with a friend and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. 

First off - the service was impeccable. I arrived before my friend and checked in with the hostess who went out of her way to make sure that we found each other. 

The space is understated and inviting. As others have said, there is a retro-diner-goes-upscale feel to the design is lovely. My friend and I shared a large booth by the window so we had a great view of the hustle and bustle of the busy intersection where WF&B sits. 

The cocktail list was on the small side, but there were more than enough choices and something tells me that if you sit at the bar, the bartender would be able to whip you up anything your heart desires. I started with a whiskey cocktail with some rosemary and my friend went for a Sex & the City classic - the cosmopolitan. Both were delicious!

I had a long time to study the menu and that's why I'm so disappointed by my order. I was sure I was going to get the lamb special and at the last minute, I went for variety and ordered the beet salad, mussels and frites. They  were all fine - the mussel broth was a little bitter and the beet salad was more of a beet tartar but overall is was perfectly fine. My friend ordered well and I was jealous. She enjoyed her half of the half chicken (they serve a thigh and a breast) and had still had half to take home. The desserts sounded interesting but we opted to go healthy and have tea/coffee instead. 

In all a great experience - I'll order better next time!"
724,"I've been anxiously awaiting my chance to check out this place; a new hip spot in my neighborhood? With parking in Portland!!! (You get one star just for that). I really like the look of this place, inside and out. Very cool and different, especially for this ""boring"" area of town.

Came at 5:30pm on a Friday and found out that we should have made a reservation. We sat at the bar and before my cocktail was even made for me a table was ready for us, however. From 5-6pm they have a happy hour at the bar, and I enjoyed a $6 happy hour cocktail which was very good. Typically the cocktails are $8-12. We settled our bar tab and sat at a table. 

The service was very friendly, from the bar staff to the servers. Everyone had a smile and was very polite. We both ordered the steak and fries, medium. The steak was good, not great. I found myself dipping it in the aioli that was for the fries to give it some flavor and moist-ness(?). Fries were great and aioli was great. My friend really enjoyed his, he did ask for BBQ sauce. 

I would come back, probably wouldn't order the steak again though. Would totally try other things on the menu. Drinks were good and service was great, did like the ambience of the restaurant. Location and parking makes this place very convenient."
725,"Came here today for a bloody and some brunch with friends. 'Twas difficult to commit to a food selection because there were so many delicious sounding options. I ended up going with a mixed green salad that had quinoa, grapes, and blue cheese in it; I had them add a poached egg which was a solid move. The bloody was delicious as well! Will definitely be back for another meal! 

Definitely a nicer place so it's a little pricier but hey- you get what you pay for!"
726,Woodfords is A delightful welcoming retro stylish design!  It feels like a diner/ cafe/ retro restaurant. Pretty basic food w grandmothers touch. Few variety to choose from for brunch. Choose from hor derves / appetizers!  Great place for gathering w friends;). Fun new spot to try out.
727,"Their burger is, hands down, the best burger in Portland.  Their special brisket blend, carmelized onions, dijonaise and BACON make it absolutely mouthwatering.  Add that yummy aioli and their delightfully seasoned fries and you can't go wrong.  Even my 5 year old loves it!"
728,"I heard a lot of foodie comments about Woodfords. First, there is parking, a small on site lot and an adjacent parking permissible at the Woodford's Club, about 100 yards up the street.

This is the old 80's Valley's steak house. The vibe is dark retro 60's. I personally am not a fan of the decor, although I readily admit, I'm not their target demographic either. I found the atmosphere way to loud and dark for my taste. The menu wasn't readable without my cell phone spotlight. Equally, the server speaking wasn't audible, I couldn't hear a word she said. Again referencing the overall vibe, it's not in my comfort zone....I just didn't enjoy the vibe.

When I first try a restaurant, my choice is to split a few small plates to see if the chef has decent cooking chops and the appetizers match the quality, style, and taste of similar places. I will give it a mixed review here. More negative than positive. 

The deviled eggs, don't smirk, were probably the most distinct and tasteful thing that we ate. Perfectly prepared, with a simple application of ground mustard, bacon, and smoked paprika, they were delicious. At $8....they aren't giving them away, but as a first course, two people get three halves each....and they were on point.

At $30 a dozen, the Damaroscotta oysters were ok....not close to Eventide in side accoutrements or, for my palate, in taste. I'd say they were average...at that price point, I expected better.

The duck mouse pate was decent....the portion was way too excessive for a shared appetizer....cut the price, and the portion size and they would have a better hit here. The pate was creamy, with toasted bread, grain mustard, and gherkins. This was probably the second best thing I sampled....but honestly, nowhere close to a good duck pate from the deli at Rosemont Market. 

Finally, we tried the steak tartare.....liked much more by my GF than I. I found the consistency way too bulky, almost a rough chop on the marinated raw tenderloin. The tartare did have a traditional raw egg yoke on top, that creates that oozing egg yumminess that steak tartare fans love.....This, unfortunately, didn't come anywhere in the ballpark of great local tartare at The Grill Room, or Timber...it just was semi flavorless, and bulky.

So that was our small plate try.....in sum, this is not a fine food establishment. I think if we came in, sat at the bar, had a microbrew and a burger, I'd probably be good with it.....but even there, the vibe and the decor, and overall loudness just isn't my cup of tea.

I'll pass on this spot.....2 1/2 stars.....in my foodie world"
729,"I really want to like WFB.  If I only went in to drink at the bar, I think I'd LOVE it.  Beautiful interior, great location, usually friendly staff.  But time and again, the food has failed me.  WFB falls into this unfortunate middle ground--the food is of a quality that it is more than just pub fare, but is priced as if it's fine dining.  The menu's pricing should be reduced by about a third on all items to make it reasonable for what's being served.

My last experience eating here made it likely I won't return to eat anytime soon.  A group of us were anticipating late dinner.  We made an online reservation for 8:45.  When we arrived at 8:45, we were told (I have to say in a  not altogether friendly way) that the kitchen closed at 9 so we should get our orders in ASAP.  If the kitchen closes at 9, why is making a reservation anytime past 8:15 even an option?  It seems a rookie mistake to not have a reasonable buffer between reservable times and closing time.  We had made the reservation around noon, so it wasn't like we were a walk-in or a surprise.  The food was, as it always is, fine, just fine.  But the staff made us feel as if we were a guilty party, hovering around our table and verbally prompting us to make our choices quickly.  Again, I avoid at all costs being the walk-in ordering food five minutes before the kitchen closes, but if you're accepting my reservation, I expect to be treated like any other earlier customer.
Finally, when our bill came, because we were a party of 7, gratuity was added to our bill.  Usually not a problem to me, except no one told us that gratuity would be added; this was never explicitly stated before we dined.  And frankly, with the staff rushing us and trying to whip us out of the restaurant as fast as possible, the gratuity was higher than I would have liked to leave.

Finally, as noted in previous comments, WFB's water game is on point definitely to a fault.  I do not need someone leaning over my shoulder every four minutes to pick up the water pitcher and pour more into my glass.  Find the happy medium!

Go to WFB, drink, maybe have their fries, which are excellent.  But it's a splurge that I would much rather make at any number of other Portland establishments."
730,"We live in walking distance, and this remains one of our favorite spots in the area. Highly recommended. Came back here twice recently with friends in the past few weeks, and my wife and I wandered in last Saturday before the dinner rush just for cheese and drinks at the bar. Service was, as always, impeccable -- the staff is very friendly, and really makes you feel comfortable. 

The drink selection remains fantastic, and the house-made sodas & shrubs are good enough to get with or without alcohol (even if you're of drinking age). If you can't make up your mind, both the waitstaff and the barstaff are highly knowledgeable and will be able to make good recommendations tailored to your specific tastes.

The food remains excellent, and certainly seems a good value compared with some other Portland-area restaurants. Portions are sized appropriately, not so small that you remain hungry, but not so large that you're overstuffed if you try a few things. Most recently, I had the steak-frites plate -- perfectly prepared strip steak, good seasoned fries (just salt & pepper, maybe some light batter?), and horseradish sauce. There were a few fries left, but not enough to pack up. On the other hand, my wife had the roast chicken and took at least half of hers home at the end of the night. Both were preceded by the mushroom tartine and the brussel sprouts (split four ways, between us and our friends) and all four of us were too full for dessert by the end."
731,"I really did like Woodford when they first opened, but... I don't know anymore. I'm not sure that it's become/is becoming the go-to neighborhood spot everyone had touted it would be (speaking as someone who can actually walk here). Now that its had time to settle in and go through a local's season to tourist season back to a local's season, I'm just not as besotted as I initially thought I was.

What I still love:
+ The cocktails. Competitive prices for Portland standards and they're really, really well crafted. From speciality drinks to simple martinis, every cocktails I've tried from here has been delicious, refreshing, balanced, and worth it. 
+ The space. I had originally described it as having a ""monochromatic-1950's diner-sans kitsch-stark without being sterile-feel"", which was cool and different for Portland. I still dig it. 

What I'm no so sure of anymore:
- The food. Small portions, big prices, and it's all just okay. It seems they run out things quickly, and the vegetarian options are uninspired and unmemorable. Again maybe this is just one of those awesome places in town that's much better for people without dietary restrictions, so maybe just ignore me (I won't be offended!) and go eat the burger here - I've heard it's the best in the city!
- The service. It's not bad, it's just... all over the place. At our latest trip here, while we had our water glasses refilled probably close to twenty times (no joke), the various people coming to our tables and relaying information to one another caused errors in our orders. We were wholly forgotten about at one point (minus the swooping in to fill our water glasses without a word) and then made to feel bad when we wanted to order food. And - despite asking for a specific kind of vodka for my martini - they decided to make all the martinis at the table with the same kind and charge us all the same price. That's not cool, is it? 

I think this is one of those places that's got two personalities: the one at the bar is much different then the one on the floor. I would absolutely come back here - for drinks, at the bar - but again, that's just me."
732,"Been a couple of times already here and the place is absolutely fantastic. The ""rotating"" weekly menu is definitely enticing to go back more and more :) 
Great cocktails, delicious food, and knowledgeable servers."
733,"Woodford Food & Beverage is a spectacular addition to Woodford's Corner. First, the bartenders are the absolute best - friendly, fun, knowledgeable, and talented. I'm always happy with their cocktails and their recommendations of which wine(s) to try. I'm still dreaming about the mojito I had a few weeks ago. Also, it's a bonus that you can get carafes/ half carafes of wine. They have a small, but good selection of beers.

Next, the food. My goodness.

Mussels [& fries]: The best I've ever had. The mussels, which on all 3 occasions I've had them, hailed from Calendar Island in Casco Bay. The broth is amazing - not overly buttery or fancy. To me, when it comes to seafood, simplicity is always best and Woodford F&B certainly delivers! On one occasion, I saw two women using the mussel shells to scoop up the remaining broth. While you could go that route, I would just get some extra bread!

Pate - It's always different. We've tried salmon, chicken, and duck. The salmon was by far my favorite, but they were all great! In fact, one of my friends who swore she didn't like duck and pate - was scooping up the last bites.

Caramelized Onion Dip / Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts - YUM. 

The Burger - Yes, it is a $16 burger. To me, it was very worth it. The brisket just melted in my mouth! Normally, I would be pretty upset with the soggy bun, but I'm pretty sure that's because I let it sit on my plate for a few minutes (too busy chatting).  It also comes with a TON of french fries.

Desserts - The strawberry rhubarb dessert with ice cream is just perfect in my book.

Overall, I just love this restaurant even when my bank account doesn't. I would recommend going to happy hour (5-6pm on weekdays, not sure about the weekend). Also, they often post their specials on Instagram."
734,"I tried to visit on the only day of the week they are closed. I made it this week and so happy I went. First, the staff is awesome. Everyone!! So nice and helpful. I would give it five stars for the customer service alone. The food is cook to perfection. My swordfish was the best I have ever had. The Brussels sprouts were yummy too! Desert, wine..check and all were YUM. Definitely a place for foodies. I look forward to going back again and again."
735,"Families?  Yes
Out drinking?  Yes
Apps and drinks?  Yes
Fancy Dinner night?  Yes

Woodford F&B has struck gold!  In an ex-car-dealership, in a somewhat drab and busy corner, is a gem.  The menu is impressive and dynamic, with both well-known and eccentric flavors.  The burger is the best burger I've ever had, period.  Ever.  And the fries are haunting my dreams.  I had pickled veggies, including tomatoes, as a complimentary appetizer.  So good!  Plus a great wine pour, which is always a bonus.

Also amazing is how you can go get oysters, foie gras, tuna nicoise, and steak tartar one night, but burgers and fries another.  Everything I've had here has been exceptional.  

And finally, it's a great restaurant off the peninsula.  I know there are others, but they're few and far between.  I don't have to drive all the way downtown to get some exceptional food, and for that I'm SO thankful.

If you haven't been here, now is the time!  You'll be impressed."
736,"This place is right around the corner from my place, and I had been meaning to come here for a while. My boyfriend and I both had the steak frites. Also, we shared a carafe of wine. I can't say that anything was wrong with this meal. Yet, simultaneously, from a food stance, it wasn't memorable in any way either. Fries were good, and portioning is huge. The meat was just OK, but basically the equivalent of my SAT scores: dead average. 

The music was nice (I like to see a hostess gettin her groove on), and I give it to the service; everyone is friendly. Yet, I think the highlight for our dining experience was making sure that we finished our bottle of wine. The server seemed somewhat surprised that just the two of us were going to finish it, and he also offered a ""take home"" option. He was very nice and only trying to offer more options in case we deemed it to be too many glasses, alas, we stayed until the last drop. What can I say, we're committed."
737,Amazing service and delicious food! The breakfast sandwich was amazing and so was the coffee. The brunch special is a great deal! Would definitely recommend!
738,I wish we lived closer to Woodford F&B because it would totally be our neighborhood go to. Informal enough to eat there a lot including the best burger of all time (brisket). Fancy enough to keep the menu interesting (amazing pork chop and chicken). Kid friendly menu although it still was a 1.5-2 hour dinner (chicken fingers and fries). Decor is totally my style: clean modern and plenty of booths.
739,"Excellent brunch, even better service. I came in a party of 4 around 10:30 am on a Sunday and the wait was about 45 minutes for a table, but the bar is full service and had open seats so we sat there. The Prix Fixe brunch deal includes bottomless coffee, a brunch cocktail of your choice, and a brunch entree. I had the breakfast sandwich and the Bloody Caesar cocktail. Both were incredible. The coffee was some of the best I've ever had. I always drink my coffee black, but my boyfriend usually adds cream and sugar. He drank his coffee black here because it was so good. Such a great find. I definitely recommend this place, & I can't wait to go back."
740,"Woodford's F & B is a fantastic space with fantastic food!  From the cocktails and hours devours to the salads and entrees, everyone can find something or their palette!  Additionally, the four bathrooms are minimalistically adorned and the music they play (at a background level) is also equally as fantastic. The best part about it is that it's not too far down Forest Avenue so that you can still find your way home after you've had an exceptional cuppa coffee from Seacoast!"
741,Amazing! One of my favorite restaurants in Portland. The burger is soooo good that it's hard to stray from. Love their pate apps. Their salads are to die for. And the brussel sprouts! Love this place - it being a bit out of downtown is a bonus for me.
742,"Entirely disappointment in this experience.  Complete diners regret.  Beyond the cute decor and very friendly staff the food drags this establishment down to a I will not return status.  They charge fine dining prices for mediocre food.  Period.  Some of the items are less than mediocre.  My daughter opted for  vegetarian entree that was unseasoned uninspired and unmemorable.  My husband received twice as many fries as you would receive anywhere else with a small steak portion that was full of gristle and tendons, lacking flavor and tough as leather.  My crab cakes were tasty and I enjoyed them until I got to the first of many bites that had inedible artichoke leaves in them. We decided to share a dessert and I am afraid our disappointment didn't end there. It was a panacotta that had zero custard texture and was more of a fluff like texture with a small portion of the top surface covered by lemon curd and a few blueberries dropped on top.    If I could do it again I would retuned our entrees and paid for our drinks and left.  This place is overpriced with small portions of food that needed to be so much better to justify its price.  Had the food been more enjoyable the 2 hour dining experience would have been an experience to remember but turned into a slow process of disappointment leading to regret."
743,"This place is great! It is my family's new favorite dinner place. I went with both of my moms and my little sister. They even have sippy cups for little little kids which was great for my sister and the kids choices are really good. The server gave us free pickled veggies when we sat down and they were spicy but really good. I tried a new kind of vegetable called okra and it was delicious. I had the pasta but next time I'm getting the chicken strips because they were incredible and I ate what my sister (and moms' tried some too) couldn't finish. Also they have like the best french fries ever.

We liked this place a lot especially because it was loud, but not too loud. My sister can be noisy but most people didn't seem to notice and also there were colored pencils and paper so we were busy until our food came. 

The bathrooms here are really big and really clean and I liked having the sink on the outside because I could reach everything. 

I think that my family will come here a lot more often because it is very close to our house and we didn't have to wait for a table and the food was really really yummy. I think this is a great choice for local families and people without kids too."
744,"Went here for the first time and the entire meal was fantastic. Had the oysters & sprouts for appetizers, and beet salad for my meal. Would definitely go again!"
745,"I travel to Maine frequently so my hope is that when I return for a visit and have dinner here again there will be an improvement.

First, I regret not writing this review a couple of months ago when I visited.  I had remembered, however, to jot down the name and what I ate in my iPhone notes.  We had ordered the filet mignon which was being featured that evening.  The server, about 10 minutes later came back out to the table and apologized that they had run out of it.  She suggested the tri-tip to be served similarly and I thought that sounded like a great idea.  Unfortunately, it was so totally chewy and raw it was barely edible.  My husband and I were having such a good time and the staff was just so nice - I didn't have the heart to say anything which I regret.  Please, do not substitute tri-tip for filet.  I mean, everyone knows they are two totally different cuts of meat but don't promote it as great.  Tri tip, in order for it to be tender must not be served rare because it is chewy and tough.  It was kind of ridiculous the way it was fanned out on the plate and then inedible.  I promise to upgrade my review next time but wanted to make sure the management is aware of this problem.   

The ambiance and everything else was very nice."
746,"I found the food here to be pretty unexceptional and over-priced. I also asked to have some greens or salad instead of toast since I can't eat wheat and the waitress said ""sure, there'll probably be a slight upcharge."" I'm pretty used to this and said ok. When we got the bill, the ""slight upcharge"" was $7 which was more than the cost of any of the sides on the menu. When you're going to up charge someone that much you need to let them know ahead of time."
747,"I absolutely love Woodford F&B. They have a few entrees and specials every night along with apps (including oysters!), salads and fun drink concoctions. The half chicken I dream about. The atmosphere is casual yet classy and cozy and the service is always good! So lucky to have this place as my neighborhood spot but I'd also drive far to land my seat here."
748,Had a great meal last night with some family that we hadn't seen in years.  They were very accommodating for the 9 of us.  Service was great. Food came quickly and was delicious.  When my daughter devours her entire meal you know if was worth it.  It's nice to see a local place killing it.
749,"Woodford Food and Beverage is just a few blocks from my house so I've had the chance to come here a number of times.  First off, the interior of the restaurant is really nice.  It has a hip, retro feel to it with a number of large booths that I find appealing.  The wait staff is also engaging, helpful, and down-to-earth.

The first few times I came here I was a bit skeptical because, in terms of food, the vegetarian options are pretty meager.  The one vegetarian entrée is called ""vegetables and grains,"" which is possibly the blandest name of a dish I have ever come across at a restaurant.  Nevertheless, it's tastier than I expected.  They also have really good shoe-string french fries that rank up there with the best in Portland.

In lieu of dinner, however, I recommend coming here for cocktails and dessert.  They may have my favorite cocktails in town.  They're tasty, well-balanced, and elegantly presented.  I also found their desserts to be sweet and delicious.

Overall, the combination of the nice ambiance, quality wait staff, and excellent cocktails and desserts give this place the edge even if their food options are somewhat disappointing."
750,"Parking sucks.  You're either on the road or have to walk a short distance to the woodfords club.  Not a big deal, but not a plus.

Five star service.

Their sound track had some CCR, so obviously this place is rad just from that fact alone.  

  Tar Tar was a hefty portion, even more so for a ""small"" portion.  Little on the peppery side, but still enjoyable.  Bread it came with was a great vessel to transport to my feeding hole.  Mussels were large, tasty and cooked in a lovely sauce.  The fries the mussels came with, holy molly, those things are dang good!  

Flounder was lovely, perfectly cooked served on a bed of rice, with a veggie and delicious sauce.  The burger, well reminded me of a Burger King rodeo burger... in an EPIC way.   Cooked a lovely medium, the thing gets a big thumbs up from me.  

Complementary cookies, well I wouldn't be pleased if I had to pay for them.  I wouldn't say they sucked, but in comparison to all the other lovely things I placed in my gut that evening, the cookies weren't great at all.

The brownie desert, with candied nuts and ice cream was a great way to end the night."
751,Cool vibe. Beyond friendly and attentive managerial and waitstaff. Burger & fries a was one of the best I've had in the this town. Cool drink offerings & specials. Seasonal salad was fresh and large enough to share. Can't wait to try brunch!
752,This place was amazing. Every single thing we tasted was great. The service was excellent. Will absolutely be coming here again.
753,"More than just a neighborhood place, WFB is one of Portland's must-visits.  We had our first brunch there yesterday after several dinners and food was once again excellent (eggs and pork belly over cheese grits, Cobb Salad, breakfast sandwich), reasonably priced, excellent service.  Past dinners have included their excellent burger, Mussels and frites, Steak tartare. Well prepared comfort food, above-average cocktails and service is always first rate."
754,"Stopped in for a Burger and Beer. 
H E A V EN.
Loved everything; service was on, Burger was a real treat and the beer selection was perfect. Could not have been happier. What an exciting addition to Woodford's Corner."
755,"The restaurant we planned to eat at tonight was closed for someone's vacation.  The second place was packed.  So we made a last-minute reservation at Woodford F & B, and we were glad we did.    
The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  

This 1970's style diner features an eclectic selection of dishes prepared with an earthy Mediterranean flare.  We started out with the beet salad and the savory duck pate.  Then the four of us each chose a different entree.  Dad enjoyed his burger, which has received many raves.  Mom's maple glazed pork chop was excellent, thick and juicy, with a smoky wood-grilled flavor.  I loved the creamy yogurt sauce and the sumac dry rub on my roast chicken.

We have only two complaints.  My husband's quahog chowder was pretty paltry for seventeen bucks.  A half-dozen clams were arranged in a puddle of thin broth along with some cubed potatoes.  This was supposed to be an entree.  It wasn't.

The other problem with this charming place is the noise.  The cheerful chatter mixes with the music from the bar and bounces off the high ceiling, making it almost impossible to converse.  Perhaps some carpeting would help?

Despite these two little glitches, I'm grateful to Woodford F & B for being an oasis of taste and civility amid the craziness of Portland on a Saturday night.  We'll definitely be back for those pork chops!"
756,"Woodford might have the best burger in town. That on it's own is a pretty big deal, right? But it's not a one trick pony either. The fries that come with it are really good too! Not my favorite fries, they are a little bit too thin maybe, and with the outside crust emphasized a bit too much for my taste. But they are covered in a fantastic Chinese five spicy kinda seasoning that more than makes up for their shortcomings. Also you get about 10,000 of them on the plate. The fries also come with the steak frites which is exactly the dependable classic that you want it to be. 

Which is pretty much the story at Woodford in general.There aren't any big surprises, it's got a classic, timeless French brasserie kinda vibe, that managers to still feel fresh and contemporary. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the Sunday night special, Croque Madame. Once again, it plays it totally by the book and delivers. And it come with a nice big salad. Which is good because if your dining companion is smart their dish will come with a pile of fries and you can share both!"
757,"I never give 5 stars to any restaurant the first time but it was tempting.  The staff is well trained and attentive without being overbearing.  There were 6 of us so we ordered a lot of different items.  We ordered a variety of appetizers and they were all delicious.  Lobster was great.  Foie gras was over the top.  I enjoyed the hake and the tomato salad.  If you are forced to eat strawberry rhubarb pie this would be the place to suffer through it.  We also tried the pan and cotta which was delicious but the white pepper shortbread cookie served with it was unexpected, creative , and delicious.  Everyone raved about everything that was put in front of them.  Extensive cocktail list and I am told that they were all excellent.  Lots of beer and even rose cider which is new to me.  

Most importantly if you really want the royal treatment ask for DJ Steve when you get there.  He's all the rage in Portland."
758,"Found this gem on a Sunday afternoon looking to get brunch and being shutout of everywhere else downtown due to long wait times. This place has excellent service, great prices and filling portions of flavorful dishes. Bloody Caesar is the best bloody I've found in Portland. Fruit with the meal was fresh. Was asked multiple times how our food was, not just dropped in front of us and never see server again. Can't wait to check out dinner here sometime."
759,"I really, really love this place. It has a funky, kind of upscale diner look but from the moment you enter the place you know you are in a place that values customers; a place that feels like you're having dinner with friends. Fabulous attention by everyone - from Fayth and Birch to the wait staff and bartenders. And the food. Easily the best burger in Portland - cooked perfectly, dressed perfectly, hot and yummy and accompanied by to-die-for fries. We've also tried salads and specials - always good. Oh, and cocktails. Oh, and a fabulous wine list."
760,"Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend after driving by for months. Was quite impressed, everything we ordered was delicious! The Emergency Margarita and Cosmo were tasty and strong. Instead of the usual side of bread most restaurants serve we got a bowl of pickled beans, tomatoes and cauliflower. For real food we got the brussel sprouts, roasted beet salad and the maple brined pork chop. Brussel sprouts were great. Beet salad was interesting but good- but got sick of it by the end of the dish. Pork chop and mashed potatoes were AMAZING. Easy seating on a Wednesday night, plenty of parking on the side streets. Was pricey for the neighborhood but worth it."
761,"Been three times for dinner and each one excellent service and food and now they have outdoor tables, yay! And a unique noon-8pm Sunday brunch starting soon.  OK picnic tables are on the busy chaos corner of Woodford but it affords some varied people watching. Love the fried brussel, the beet walnut salad, the cocktails and specials. The latest I had was a hake in mustard, fennel, creme fraisch sauce most perfectly cooked and savory. A dry riesling paired well. Very neighborhood feel, spartan but warm. Tons of parking just past at the Club if you drive."
762,"Great cuisine, service and vibe. Out party had kale salads, a pork chop, roast chicken, and a burger that rivals the East Ender's as my favorite in town.  The staff was great, and genuinely happy we were there. Worth the short drive from downtown."
763,"Unexpectedly excellent food at Woodfords Corner. Food was fresh and well prepared.  Service was attentive and prompt but not overbearing.  Nice variety on menu, something for everyone.  Delicious!"
764,"We were happy when we learned this restaurant was being added to our neighborhood. After eating there we were thrilled! Food (especially burger), cocktails (some prohibition era drinks) and service were excellent. Parking can be a bit tricky, but the Woodford club is just up the street (like 300 yards) and you can generally park there. Don't miss out on this gem!"
765,"The place throws me off a little.  It was decorated like an upscale diner or cafe. Has one of the best changing tables for the babies.  Large booth for seating.  The place was marked with $$$, but the selections were limited as we came at 3, in between the change of menus.  Cocktail Shrimp were large and fresh, slightly raw but that's what the lemon was for.  Devil eggs are a must, the York were soft like the ice cream cone, it was just perfectly put together.  Mussels was great, just the right amount of garlic.  My burger was definitely quality over quantity, smaller than what I'd expect from a $18 burger, small buns, thick patty, grilled onions, pickles, bacon, cooked exactly as I ordered medium well.  Fries were some of the best as well. Oh yea, staffs were super friendly, I find this is to be the case everywhere here in Portland."
766,"Just meh all around. Too pricey for what you're getting- service included. I asked our server about the Tri-tip steak, her response was ""It's just a different cut of steak"". For $22, I would have liked a little more information. My boyfriend ordered a beer that never came, to which the server did apologize, but we were one of three tables on a weekend evening at 730...

That being said, the food was good. We will probably try again if we're desperate to get off the peninsula."
767,"My boyfriend and I tried Woodford F&B for the first time Friday night.  It was a solid experience from the time we walked in until we left.  The restaurant was full when we arrived, but we waited just a few minutes before being seated.

The service was on point, our waitress was attentive, knew the specials, and was able to answer our questions about the menu items. Additionally, other waitstaff stopped at our table a couple of times to ask if we needed anything. As a matter of fact, all of the Woodford staff were extremely hospitable and gracious.

The Food:

We had the deep-fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer, the leaves having mostly separated from the heads, arrived with the texture of the charred pages of a novel.  While they retained a pleasant flavor and the accompanying sauce was complimentary, the airy consistency made for an awkward dance on the palate. Both Tiqa and Boda excel in their preparation of this trendy micro- cabbage, Woodford should take note.  I should mention that the portion is sizable, and despite the awkward dance, we finished them.

I had the whole grain risotto, it was the best I have ever tasted.  It was full of grains, wheat berries, farro etc., and mascarpone, it was as moist and creamy as anything I have ever put in my mouth.  Cooked to perfection.

He had the braised lamb shank special.  It was meaty and delicious, and it took everything he had to not pick up the bone to gnaw at the remaining juicy slivers of stringy sinew.  

We also shared a crusty apple crisp-ish dessert with ice cream.  It, too, was delicious.  The dessert to ice cream ratio was spot on, and, again, the overall portion size was, well, it was HUGE, and that's not something I say often.

We liked the atmosphere, the floor to ceiling ceramic tile, the diner tables, and the not quite finished floor...totally felt like a neighborhood joint, no pretension, just great food at reasonable prices."
768,"Enjoyed a visit to this iconic location, a Valles restaurant in my youth. They have done an excellent job with the restoration. While a bit pricy the food was excellent and the service very attentive. It is worth checking out if in the area."
769,"The service is impeccable, the food is so good (comfort food and some great fresh seafood options) and its walking distance from Baxter Woods. Having tried a few places in our new neighborhood this is a clear standout. I'm a picky drink orderer and my Hendricks Gimlet up with simple syrup came AS ORDERED and that says A LOT about a bar for me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND a stop in for dinner here. Tell Canaan Jen and Chris sent you.!


UPDATE:
We held our post wedding brunch at Woodford F&B this week. Their first dip into private events and they pulled out all the stops for us! My picky eaters LOVED all their food! Thank you Fayth!!"
770,"From a decor perspective, it's a very modern and clean lined rendition of a semi - classic diner.  Creative cocktail menu, curated beer and wine selection, and daily drink specials.  The menu is creative, but I wish there were a few more dishes.  The weekly specials looked great, but only salmon was available the day I came; not my favorite.  I would have loved to try the skate wing (or any other day's special), but to no avail.  Maybe next time.  Also, every dish seems to have an ""aioli.""  Perhaps the chef needs to scrap that idea, and focus on creating lighter, more modern sauce versions (just a suggestion).  Brussels sprouts as a starter were incredible, with a crisp smoky flavor we loved.  Cheese selection (of one) was tasty, but it was only one cheese; would prefer three smaller portions instead of just one.  For Main courses, we had the salmon special (simply prepared, for my son), the steak frites, and the pork chop.  Salmon was undercooked; I'm not a fan of the ""rare"" salmon.  Should be cooked fully or almost fully.  Not to our liking.  Pork Chop was the table hit; thick, juicy and spiced just right.  Steak frites was also above average; medium rare sliced steak over a horseradish cream.  Fries were crispy and tasty.  Service was professional if a bit too stiff.  Overall, three stars for a ""good,"" if not great, dining experience."
771,"Way over priced for the quality. The half chicken was two small pieces and the sauce was forgettable. Sadly the waitress,while very attentive, had no idea what wine went with any dish. She also didn't know what liquors are offered at the bar. The ""chef's taste"" was onions with broccoli and cauliflower. That's a side dish, not a sample of the chefs talents.
I'll wait for the next owner before going back. The space is very nice, but they come off as a bunch of kids on trust funds that think they can throw anything on a place and charge $25.00 for it.
I will say that the two stars are for the dessert. That was delicious."
772,"The fries.  Wow.  Great fries. 

They start with the pre-coated,  frozen variety, which tend to crisp up better than fresh cut, twice- cooked, raw potato version. And it is that crispness, plus their proprietary seasoning,  and the perfect  aioli that make these the tastiest fries I've ever eaten - period. The fries alone make this place worth a visit. 

The rest of the menu is an eclectic mix of classic bistro fare and comfort food with a few American staples mixed in. The entree menu is abbreviated (2 beef, 1 pork, 1 fish, 1 chicken, 1 veggie entree).  A broader selection of appetizers, some salads, and a burger round out the menu, with a list of daily specials adding diversity. There is an adventurous cocktail, wine and craft beer menu with something for all palates, and a kids menu too - often a plus for us. 

The building is a converted space, a former Valle's steakhouse. And while the tables and settings were neat and clean, the hard floor to ceiling surfaces made for somewhat noisy environs.  The plain walls and decor lacked visual interest, offset by a few retro architectural details like the pitched bead-board ceiling.  Hand written signs on office paper taped to doors & windows are an eyesore, belying quality elsewhere.   An interior designer could easily spruce up some of these defects pretty easily. 

Service was friendly, knowledgeable, prompt and attentive, but uneven at times. No major flaws, just a bit choppy in communication and execution. 

The oysters, pate, mussels w frites were mostly well executed -  the baguette was overly tough, and the meunière a bit too garlicky and needing a tad more butter and a green herb. The mussels were just slightly past done, making them a little chewy, and the pate improved as it warmed to room temp. 

But the fries.  Oh the fries.   Go for the fries.   We'll be back to test this place out few times before giving a final verdict."
773,"I wish I had 5 more stars to give this place. I drive by here at least 4 times a week. I've been saying since I moved here 4 months ago 'I really wanna try that place, it looks cool.' I've followed them on instagram and have drooled over the pictures. WTF took me so long?! Well NYE I finally gave this place a go. Holy shit guys. This place is NOT playing around. From the atmosphere to the music and the lighting you automatically feel like ' hey, this is a cool place.' Doesn't feel too 'hipster' nor too 'expensive' . It kinda encompasses the laid back and cool style of Portland. The service is OUT OF THIS WORLD. You can always tell something about a business and the owner by the attitude of the staff. Everyone was super fucking nice and chill. Our waitress was fantastic. I wish I remembered her name but seriously this woman was awesome! We ordered the Oysters from Damariscotta . If eating oysters was like having sex then I definitely orgasmed like 4 times. So fresh and so tasty! My Boo got the Tennessee ham. He is from Tennessee and it made me happy when he said ' this reminds me of what my papaw used to cook'. It was beyond cool that the dish took him back in time. But that's how awesome this place is. Our waitress told us that the owner is a freak about researching ham and is determined the find the best. This kinda passion definitely shines through in the restaurant. 
For the main dish I got the Casio Bay Flounder and OMG. I can confidently say it was the BEST dish I have ever had. So perfectly cooked and put together. Every single bit was melting in my mouth. I was in disbelief each time I took a bite. My Boo got the steak and fries and he was thoroughly enjoying the meal as well, however he wanted mine more once he got a bite. 
I can't say enough good things about this place. It's awesome. I love that it's not downtown too. Its like a little gem outside the city. 
Can't wait to see what else this restaurant has to off this year. If you are looking for an amazing dinner with fantastic service, great vibes, and cool music.........GO!"
774,"One of the best meals I've had during a two week long training stint in Portland. Birch, the owner personally waited on us and was excellent at communicating the menu, ingredients and vision of the place. A welcome break from waterfront lobster rolls! Everything was excellent from the unique craft  beer selections to the dessert! Will definitely venture here again when in Portland again."
775,"I hesitated to try this cool new neighborhood restaurant too soon for fear of not having time to work out the kinks but that was no problem here! These people are pros! They know what they are doing and I loved it here! The food was delicious! I had a burger and it was perfect! The servers were great! No attitudes here even my friend unconsciously made a comment about the bartenders height, (he was very tall!) he was gracious as can be and I was grateful he did not seem offended. I hope to spend lots of time here as it was fun to run into so may of my neighbors. Definitely upscale.


I've been here many many times. My only complaint is I wish the bar was friendlier. They are pretty hard to warm up to. It makes a difference to me as I wait on people all day long too. At the end of the day I wanna sidle up at a bar and be met with a friendly face, not a dry can't be bothered type. Stay focused on kindness guys, it matters."
776,"I went here with two of my family, and overall it was a good experience. I'd personally give the food a 3/5, based on what we ordered, which was the Burger, Croque Madame (w/o the egg), and mussels. I had the mussels. The Burger (which is the menu name) was AMAZING - soft, juicy, and flavorful. However, it was a grease trap and sent oil running down my brother's hands when he ate it. The Croque Madame has excellent sauce and garnishing, and the cheesy topping was delicious. The meat, a slice of ham, wasn't as impressive, but overall decent meal. Lastly, I would not recommend the mussels. They were worse than the ones you can buy at the store and boil for half the price. I'd say they were severely underseasoned. But the ambience and the service make up for the food. Our waitress was warm and accommodating. They even included a pretty postcard of the restaurant at the end of the meal. Go here for a nice time with your people but possibly not for the dining."
777,"Drinks were great! Very well balanced cocktails which is a simple task but hard to achieve! Nice atmosphere and a great area. I think it used to be a mortgage loan place converted into a restaurant. Woodford FB, Tipo, BigSky, Bayou kitchen and the many ethnic restaurants around this area has been a great addition to the back cove neighborhood. Didn't try the food so can't comment on that but it smelled great!"
778,Finally checked this place out last night. We loved it. Great new addition to the neighborhood. Caramelized onion dip was amazing. Great vibe.
779,"WF&B is my favorite place to meet a friend for a drink and our go-to spot for date night dinner. The staff is THE BEST! Warm, friendly, relaxed, attentive without being intrusive. The cocktails offerings are updated seasonally (with frequent specials/experiments) as is the menu. We've sampled most of the dinner offerings over time and we have not been disappointed. Looking forward to trying brunch soon. Bonus points: this place is super family-friendly. I don't just mean they have a good kids menu. I mean that they are genuinely pleased to have families in the dining room with everyone else, and they have appropriate expectations about kid behavior."
780,The food was good although a little overpriced.  My biggest complaint would be  that every time I saw a waitress she was either picking at her teeth or licking her fingers.  Hands in mouth or hovering over people's plates is no beuno in the food industry.  One actually wiped sauce off the rim of the plate and kicked her finger. Gross. I kept a close eye when mine came out.
781,"I've been here at least ten times.  Step aside NOSH, there is a new Sheriff (Burger) in town.  The lamb and Beef burger here is amazing every time, with thick cut bacon and perfectly cooked temps.  I dream about it.  The fries are light and crispy too.  Bartenders Todd and Claire are amazing, and Owner Burch and his wife will be present to make sure your experience is excellent.  You will not find the prices low, but you will get value for your dollar and delicious food.  The Chef is top notch.  Great view of the busy wood fords traffic coming back and forth as well...this gem is a must try."
782,"A delightful Bistro in an unlikely location. Portland's culinary scene is extending out of the Old Port and into neighborhoods that have previously lacked exciting dining options. Woodford F & B has a chef who spent time at Fore Street and teams her expertise with other experienced players, to create Woodford F&B. The funky building was once a dry cleaner and the big windows and high ceilings make for a happy physical location. The food is Bistro fare with steak frites, mussels, pate, oysters, lovely salads and some delightful seafood and daily specials. Desserts are simple and tasty and the wine list well priced and interesting. We had outstanding service and were thrilled to have our party of 8 so well accommodated on busy Memorial Day weekend. Get yourself to Woodford before the line to get in extends around the block, this neighborhood gem won't be unknown for long."
783,"It is very rare that Yelps steers me wrong, but I simply don't understand the high ratings for this place. We visited recently on our vacation and were completely underwhelmed. It sort of looks like a converted old 50s/60s diner, which could be really cool if executed correctly -- but mostly it seemed grungy and run-down. But it's always all about the food, right? Well, nothing special here. I tried the onion dip folks raved about -- VERY heavy on the mayo, and it was cold. Also had a salad with asparagus - the most paltry looking asparagus ever. Wilted, rubbery. Salad over dressed and tasted largely of pure vinegar. My partner orderer the chowder, and as a former chef - very unimpressed. Thin broth, virtually void of seasoning, only a couple pieces of seafood. And all this for an over $100 price tag? I just can't recommend it. The only reason it gets two stars is that the service was good, and they were especially nice to my kid."
784,"I never leave Yelp reviews, but after my dinner tonight I feel compelled. To start with, these guys have some of the best cocktails in town hands down. I arrived close to closing time, but the bartender (Miranda) was very friendly and talkative. I ordered the pork chop, but unfortunately there seemed to be a communication breakdown in the kitchen and it took over 20 minutes for them to prepare it even though there was hardly anybody else in the restaurant. A man who I later realized was either the manager or the owner brought my meal to me and apologized for the wait, but when I cut into it I could see that it was not cooked all the way through. Miranda took it away without a second question and apologized, saying she would comp my drink. At that point I ordered a second cocktail  and tried to be patient, but the second try took the kitchen almost 15 minutes, so at that point I was getting pretty impatient and probably visibly irritated. Again, the owner/manager dude brought my plate out and apologized wholeheartedly. As I ate my meal I couldn't deny that it was delicious, and when I finally asked for the check Miranda had taken about $30 off my bill. I was blown away, and instantly the frustration from the long wait disappeared. To make it even better, the owner/manager dude then came over with a bottle of Fernet and we took shots together. I have worked many years in the restaurant industry and I can't remember a time when a manager has shown such a genuine interest in making up for a kitchen staff's mistake, which happens from time to time no matter how nice the restaurant might be. I really appreciate the care that they took in providing a positive experience for me, and I will definitely be back."
785,Tried the restaurant after reading reviews and close to home.  Cheese platter had one slab of cheese and a few nuts.  Steak was 23 - should have been a filet at that price. Fries were drowning in salt - painful. Maybe good for drinks but will definitely not be back for dinner.
786,"My partner and I just finished dinner out with 2 friends, and all 4 meals were delicious!!  Risotto for me, chicken, lamb, and steak for my mates.  We also had great apps, fried Brussels and deviled eggs.  Everything was truly excellent.  Portland had a high bar
 for a good meal, this place exceeded all expectations."
787,"Just ok. We were really surprised when we got the bill and it was $100 for two of us. We did have an app and each had a drink (ok, I had two) but the food and the service were just fair to good (not great), and the atmosphere didn't do it for me. It's an odd building that has been repurposed, but I don't think they achieved the charming feel they were striving for. And I realize that this might be a positive for families with young kids, but there were A LOT of young kids in here on a Friday evening, so if that's not your thing, just beware."
788,"This place was amazing. I had been wanting to try it for a long time, and it was definitely worth the wait. The staff were polite and attentive. The food was delicious. I was there with a party of 5 and all of us ordered different things, there wasn't one compliant. I ordered the roasted beets and walnuts and the steak tartare, both excellent."
789,First place my husband and I walked out of. Pretentious and staff was not too attentive. No idea how the food was as we left annoyed before ordering.
790,"YES!!!  I am so excited that a quality restaurant has come to Woodford's Corner.  This place has it all - great food, amazing community oriented vibe, awesome interior, owners that are ready and willing to put in the labor and the love to grow an awesome locals spot.... and it's hopefully the anchor for the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  So, to elaborate on each of those topics... 
Food - I had the daily fish.  It was pollock the night I went - not always a fish I gravitate to because I feel like it's easy to overcook - no such trouble at WFB.  It was perfectly cooked on a bed of greens and wheat berries.  The deep-fried brussels sprouts were addictively crispy/savory.  Husband had the chicken... comfort food at its finest.  And a good kid's menu to boot.  Friends at a nearby table were raving about the burger and mussels and fries.  The menu features a handful of favorites, and a ""plat du jour"" section.  The theme seems to be a combination of rich comfort food, super well executed pub classics, and a smattering of ingenious and unexpected details.
Vibe - Well, we showed up at 5 cause that's when our kids get hungry... the place was full within 45 minutes of good-restaurant-starved Deering Center peeps.  Seriously, everyone I know in the neighborhood has been saying, for years, that we need a restaurant with great food and a great vibe to be the gathering spot.  This is it.  
Interior - Husband and I both remarked on how cool the windows and blinds were.  To be honest, blinds are not something I would normally notice, let alone comment on.  But these things somehow transformed the ridiculous Forest Ave snarl of headlights into.... mood lighting.  We also loved the diner style booth seating.
Owners - one of the owners, Birch, came by and said introduced himself.  It's clear this is a labor of love and he and his wife are in it for the long haul.  They're invested in this neighborhood and we couldn't be happier to have them.
 So, mark my words, this is more than a new restaurant... it's a spot for the neighborhood to gather at... it's the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  But the food and vibe is good enough to draw you guys from the peninsula.  Don't worry, there's parking for you at the Woodford's Club.  But we'll be walking every time we go, which will be often."
791,"Great atmosphere and delicious foods, super pleasant settings. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will definitely come back."
792,"This place feels like it's having an identity crisis. The furniture and lighting scream ""diner"" but the cloth napkins, candlelight, funky decor and sophisticated menu whisper ""high end."" Very confusing atmosphere to say the least. The menu had some classic staples but also a lot of what I as a low-class person can only call 'bizarre' food items. Me and my friend decide to try something new so we each order one of the appetizer specials as our meal (I can only assume they were appetizers because the portions were very small). Both were disgusting. I had what I can only describe as mushroom and eggplant bruschetta which had the consistency of rubber and was borderline unpalatable. I don't often say that food is bad or gross, I might say ""okay"" or ""not very good,"" but this was seriously unpleasant to eat. My friend had some sort of tuna and avocado tartar which was essentially flavorless. On top of a disappointing meal the bill was outrageous: two beers and two small appetizers totaled $45!

Giving them two stars because it was clean and the service was good. Maybe other things on the menu could change my mind but I'm not chancing another $45 bucks to find out."
793,A perfectly delightful meal.  We sat at the bar as the place was packed at 5:30 on a Saturday night. The service was prompt and personal even though it was busy.  We had the caramelized onion dip as an app.  A bit disappointing in that it was not warm and a bit on the sweet side but the excellent chips made up for these small failings. My guy had the pork shank. We loved the sauce but found the pork to lack flavor.  My steak was superb and I am a steak snob.  It was cooked to a perfect med rare and came sitting on a bed of divine horseradish sauce.  The fries were also very good. We will return.
794,"Great food, friendly staff, a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Nice basic dishes and the stake tartare is awesome (small is huge!)"
795,Outstanding! The food was wonderful! We brought friends from out of state and everyone was extremely happy with the food. Our waiter was personable and welcoming! He made great suggestions from the menu.
796,"Such a great experience at this restaurant! The hostess, server & owner were all so friendly and welcoming! The food was great, I especially loved the deep fried Brussels sprouts - delicious! The atmosphere is really fun, great new place to try, we'll be back for sure!"
797,"Super nice staff, good branding and interior design, food is mediocre, been once won't return. Bummed cause it looks great.

Caramelized onion dip was like a can of supermarket dip with rosemary sprinkled on it, although harder to eat as the onion pieces are huge. It's cold, house chips are cold, not at all what i was hoping for.

Bib salad was overdressed in a flavorless rendition of green goddess, candied peanuts in it were tasty, but didn't incorporate well.

Crab cakes were way over seasoned, had no lump meat in them, but plenty of cartilage (I'd forgive that if there was discernible crab meat).

Burger was good tasting but way too greasy.

Fries on both orders were so overdone they were like old potato sticks. Flavorless, completely dried out husks.

For this price point there are much better options in Portland."
798,"Truly love this wonderful new spot to dine in my neighborhood. I've only been there a couple of times and already wish their menu was more diverse or changed more frequently, but every element of the meal, from drink to entrée, is delicious!! Very friendly staff too!"
799,I really wanted to like this place because it's got a great location. The waitstaff was nice and attentive. I love the way the inside was remodeled. I tried the Brussels sprouts appetizer which was fine. I was excited to try the burger because I heard it was really good. I felt uncomfortable with the $16 dollar price on the burger but threw caution to the wind. This burger sucked. It tasted like it had been doused in vinegar. Not a little vinegar but ALOT.
800,"You want a local Portland Maine lobster roll - this is your place. I love coming to J's for a lobster roll and an Allagash White. 

Is it the best lobster roll in Portland - no, but I love the service, price and people here. 

In the summertime you can sit outside right on the water.

The lobster salad is also a good option, and I'm a fan of the clams."
801,"J's Oysters is a small Restaurant by the dock. sitting is limited. Service is great and crowded on a Saturday late afternoon early evening.   It is a casual atmosphere restaurant 

We ordered Maine Oysters, Alaskan King Crab, and steamed clams... It was my first time to eat steamed clams, so the waiter showed us how to clean it by taking the ""brains"" and dumping it in hot water to take the sand off.I think moving forward I would stick with fried clams or mussels... :) 

The oysters were good, but I am used to the Gulf oysters that are very meaty. Alaskan King Crab had a good portion."
802,"Ok so this was the first place I visited for dinner when visiting Portland, Maine for my first time and I was not disappointed! My girlfriend and I couldn't wait to get our hands on some fresh seafood enjoyed by the locals, and my godmother (a local) raves about this place and treated us here.

We parked down the street from the parking lot (free parking) as the parking lot for the establishment was packed. It is right on the harbor with a beautiful view of fishing boats and waterfront. It is a smaller restaurant that is by no means fancy. Its got a hole-in-the-wall feel, which is what I love, and I already knew the food was going to be incredible. 

Upon walking inside we were instantly greeted with a warm smile and welcome, and were told that there was no seating available at the moment but were more than welcome to sit at the bar to eat. This place was packed and we visited in December (completely out of season), and late at night! Filled with locals and fishermen. My girlfriend and I ordered some Allagash beer served in a chalice. I fell in love with this beer and miss it now that I'm back here in south Florida. 

We then received our table and were greeted by our waitress. We ordered a medium bucket of steamers ($17.50), crab stuffed mushrooms ($12.50), and clam chowder ($7.50). The steamers were good, but a little too overcooked. They are served with broth on the side to clean each clam but no matter how much I seemed to ""de-sand"" the clams I always bit into sand which was a bit of a turn off for me. but they were still pretty good! The mushrooms were delicious! We found ourselves picking ever morsel of cheese and stuffing out of the dish because they were so good! The clam chowder was the star of the star of the show for the appetizers. I don't know if it was because I have never had authentic clam chowder from New England before or what but WOW! Loaded with clams, with so much flavor. Not to thick and creamy, yet not watery. Perfect consistency. Served with those oyster crackers, simply perfect chowder.

For our entrees, we ordered the seafood casserole ($28), lobster scampi ($26.50), and scallops with lemon and dill pasta ($25). I ordered the lobster scampi, and was blown away. The dish was so simple yet so delicious. generous portions of lobster in a garlic butter wine sauce on angel hair. SO GOOD! My girlfriend got the scallops. 5 jumbo sized scallops over a creamy lemon dill sauce with angel hair. Once again, so simple yet perfect dish. Scallops were fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. My godmother ordered the seafood casserole consisting of lobster, shrimp, scallops, crab and other delicious stuff topped and topped with breadcrumbs. It was very good from what I tried and very generous portions of seafood but a little bit to much stuffing and breadcrumbs for me. However it was a great dish, just personal preference.

I will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Maine. Great homemade food with fresh caught seafood. Friendly and attentive staff that treats you like family. A real locals' spot. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu!"
803,"I took a quick trip to Portland and J's came highly recommended. Overall, we weren't disappointed.

Pros: J's has a great selection of fresh seafood. The lobster roll was one of the best I've had--the lobster was very flavorful and fresh. It came with mayonnaise but I only used butter because that's really all you needed. My husband had the crabby Janice and also loved it. While we didn't get oysters, they seem to be the most popular dish and everyone around us appeared to be enjoying them. They also have a full bar and some non seafood menu items (although not sure why you would want that). The atmosphere is sort of local/homey and a lot of people there seemed to be regulars.

Cons: The clam chowder we had was a little bland. In addition, we went on a cold day and since it's on the water it was a little chilly inside and hard to get comfortable. Also doesn't have the easiest parking, we ended up paying $12 for a lot next door so be careful where you park if you have a choice. 

Bottom line: Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area, especially for the lobster roll."
804,"I'd say the 3 and 1/2 stars is a fair average rating for J's. Not the best seafood we have had, but a fun atmosphere and good location! Our waitress was very nice and accommodating. I had a lobster roll, which had quite a bit of lobster on it and was pretty good. Being from CT, I will always be slightly biased against cold lobster rolls! My husband had a lobster pasta dish with licorice flavor in it, which was a bit overwhelming and odd to us. Overall, a good place to grab some seafood!"
805,"3.5 stars rounded up.

When in Maine, eat where the locals eat. My friend and her husband wanted to take us to their favorite oyster bar for dinner. She swears it's the best oyster bar she's been to since moving to Portland a couple years ago. 

Nicknamed ""the pearl of the waterfront"", J's Oyster has been a local favorite since 1977, so we were really looking forward to having a great meal on our first night in Portland. 
http://bit.ly/2PDmJDY

When we got there a little after 7pm, both the indoor and outdoor dining areas were packed solid. Luckily we didn't have to wait longer than 20+ minutes as many of the outdoor diners were already finishing up and paying their bills. We chose to sit outdoors because the set-up inside was so divey, humid and musty. There was a huge u-shaped bar that took up majority of the dining area, so trying to navigate through the restaurant to get to the restroom was tricky because you'll end either up bumping up against the seated diners or crashing into a servers if you're not careful.

Our server was nice enough but wasn't able to tell us which particular oyster types from Maine or Virginia was avail for the night. From what I've read up on before my trip, Maine has about 6-8 different harvesters/suppliers that farms oysters with different tastes and characteristics....oh well.
The food and stiff drinks arrived fairly quickly, so that was a plus. I have to agree with my friend about the oysters and crab legs being good, but everything else was rather underwhelming.  

MAINE OYSTERS ($28/dozen, we ordered 2 dozen): 
http://bit.ly/2yR9LsO
It was a little meatier than the Virginia oysters but I didn't find it be briny enough. Very very subtle, almost tasted like it was kept in fresh water or submerged in melted ice for too long.

VIRGINIA OYSTERS ($23/dozen, we ordered 2 dozen):
http://bit.ly/2D32Cbq
http://bit.ly/2DoXD6f
My favorite out of the 2. Smaller bivalves that tasted crisp and briney. I was able to enjoy as is without any cocktail sauce. 

ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS DINNER served with steamed clams and corn on the cob ($26 marketprice):
http://bit.ly/2PesMzl
My friend's husband totally wiped out this dish. He said the crab was good but the portions were too small for his appetite so he was still hungry. 

MAINE RED HOT DOG served with a pickle spear and chips ($5.50):
http://bit.ly/2D6mevF
I ordered 1 hot dog each for both myself and my friend's husband towards the end of our meal because we were both still hungry, lol.
When it arrived, I laugh out loud because it looked exactly like Hawaii's Redondo's red beef&pork hot dogs. It tasted like it too.
- I finished mines because I was hungry, but my friend's husband took only one bite and never picked it back up.  

PAN-STEAMED MUSSELS ($13.50): 
http://bit.ly/2DlYBzU
This was a hit with everyone at our table. Everything from the perfectly-cooked mussels to the garlicky savory sauce laced with butter and chilies was delightful. The toasted soft buns was great for sopping up all that wonderful garlic broth at the bottom of the bowl. 

OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER ($11 FOR 3):
http://bit.ly/2JENsKQ
Cheesy garlicky spinach on top of oyster shells. There was very little oysters in this dish. I wasn't able to find any oysters in mine at all.

BAKED STUFFED OYSTERS ($11 FOR 3):
http://bit.ly/2SLR1mD
Same issue as the oysters rockefeller, not much oysters and lobster. Menu said ""3 oysters with a lobster stuffing"" but all I got from it was mounds of really dry breadcrumbs and bacon. Thank goodness for beers and vodka to wash it all down. 

STEAMED CLAMS ($12.50 sm, $17.50 med & $22.50 lg):
http://bit.ly/2FcYZCO
I was really looking forward this bucket of bivalves. The medium bucket we ordered came with a generous amount of steamer clams, butter for dipping and a 2 bowls of broth.
- FYI, the broth is NOT FOR CONSUMPTION per our server. 
You're supposed to ""wash"" your clam meat by swishing it back and forth in the broth to remove all the sand and grits after you shell them before eating.
- Such a shame because although the clams were meaty & tasty, it was hard to get passed all that grit every time you chew. The rinsing instructions given to us didn't help, there was still a lot of crunchy grit left. Not a very enjoyable way to eat clams.

Hey at least the oysters and mussels were good =)

Hours:
Mon-Sat 11:30am- 11:30pm

Parking: They have a small private lot, but it fills up quickly. We took a Lyft there."
806,"I had one of my favorite Portland meals right here at J's Oyster: steamers, or Maine soft shell steamed clams. Damn, these were so, so good.

Essentially, you get a bucket of steamers, along with a bowl of the clam broth that they've been cooked with, plus some melted butter. Open the shell of a steamer, take out the clam, pinch and remove the outer ""skin,"" swish the clam in the broth to remove the sand (while maintaining the flavor), dip it in butter, then take a bite and transport yourself to heaven. J's steamers are so juicy and flavorful all on their own. When you have quality seafood you don't need much else than butter, if that.

You can also get a lobster dinner for $32, which comes with a whole steamed lobster, about a dozen steamers, and an ear of corn. The corn isn't the juiciest, but it's still nice and sweet. The lobster is also perfectly cooked, and aside from that you can't really mess up lobster. And the steamers... well, I think I've covered that in depth.

The four stars are due to a few missteps with our other dishes. My Maine oysters were a bit sloppily shucked and the sizes were inconsistent, with some being pretty deflated-looking and sad. The Cajun scallop roll was over seasoned and salty, so much so that the scallop flavor was lost. The dish was also loaded with potato chips, which I'm not a big fan of, but that's more of a personal thing. My friend got the Crabby Janice (crab casserole topped with bread crumbs and mornay sauce) and it was really, really rich and heavy. Not too shabby as a shared appetizer or something, but as a whole entree it was too much to take.

But those steamers... Sigh. I want to go back. We heard from several of our rideshare drivers that J's is the place where locals go, and I understand why."
807,"As you approach J's it looks like your standard dive seafood restaurant near the water. It has a small, free parking lot that is frequently full with roaming cars looking for a spot. This is because the meters charge a ludicrous $10/hr charge. Just some additional information and logistics here before we get to the bulk of the review. 

Now, as you approach the building it is nothing special, a basic building that has a bar that takes up about 2/3 of the total seating space. If you don't have a reservation (or are very lucky like us), you will likely be grabbing a beer or drink from here or dining here if you are alone or with another guest (tables for 2 are hard to come by at peak times). The place will be full with regulars, local fishermen and workers, as well as airline personnel and tourists... you can even spot business-people here during the lunch hour as everyone has come to love J's or are brought here by the lore that comes with its reputation. The decor screams ""beach town"" in the campy, vacation kinda way with the bar seeming like a dark-wooded version that you would see in a fishing town drama movie or TV show. It kind of adds to the whole experience of the meal in my opinion, setting you up to really feel like you are living and eating like the local dockworkers and fishermen do, even if it is just for an hour or so. 

We shared a bowl of the clam chowder (think smooth, creamy, briny perfection), a med bucket of clams (eating demo included), and the lobster roll (a little butter on the grilled bun, a little mayo, and a TON of lobster). Full disclosure here and allow me to put low ratings' complaints to bed... this is NOT FANCY FOOD. What it lacks in presentation and over the top methodologies of prep it delivers in the highest quality seafood using traditional recipes you will find in New England. Everything is treated as it should be and allows the freshness and briny flavors of the sea to come through and be the star of the meal. The ""ocean meats"" as my wife and I have come to call them were treated with the Midas Touch and had the perfect level of heat applied without creating a rubbery mess that gets stuck all through your teeth or tastes like a bad fish market smells. If you're not familiar with the type of clams they sell, they even give you a demonstration of how to properly eat them and not get seawater all over yourself in the process, which was appreciated if not a bit funny after they watched me struggle to figure out what to do with a 2-3# bucket of clams that I had never seen before. 

The prices are more than reasonable which I think add to the lore of this place. The servers are friendly and while they may not be the most prompt individuals it is because the whole restaurant is a madhouse of people for most of the time it is open. While that is not necessarily an excuse or ""out"" for the slower service... the whole vibe is a little more laid back and I'm 100% fine with that as long as I'm not trying to get in and out in less than an hour on a working lunch. 

If you are looking for something fancy, this is not the place for you. However, if you are looking for some of the finest seafood treated in the manner it should be and don't mind sitting back and relaxing a bit to be served, then I assure you that disappointment shall not cross your lips at J's."
808,"Back again but on a cruise. Brought our family to J's because we love it so much!


For  our first night in town we chose to return to J's. We have eaten here on several other visits but this one was the best so far! 
We both ordered the Lobster Dinner. For $28. each, we enjoyed steamers, corn and a 1.5 lb lobster. The steamers were excellent! They almost melted in your mouth. The lobster was cooked perfectly.
For a little dive on the water, this venue is always a pleasant surprise."
809,"Came in here for lunch while I was visiting Portland. The place seems divey but it's clearly been around for decades so I feel its allowed. 

We ordered the New England Clam Chowder, steamers, and oysters. The chowder was really good. Thick, but not too much, and loaded with clams. The steamers were good but I felt they good have been a little bigger. The oysters were nice and briney. 

This is definitely a place that's been on the pier for years. You can tell not only by the decor, but the patrons as well. It's worth a visit."
810,"Once you get the attention of the staff, you're in!  Even on a busy Saturday afternoon sitting at the bar.  I had the shrimp as a starter and of course the lobster soiree' as the entree.  You can not go wrong.  Every now and then, I felt the staff was just visiting the planet----they were slammed and needed to catch a breath.  They did a great job, but I was in the off-season and felt the place could have been better staffed.

Loved the place and the food.  Will return."
811,"Our ""must go"" place in Portland. Great fresh seafood served without airs, very good  cocktails. We done the price point for the quality A+! Cash only but an ATM oN site. If you want to potentially talk to local fisherpeople this is your place"
812,"Since J's is a salty, old fashioned seafood joint, there are gluten free options. There's nothing fancy about the place...it's just good, fresh seafood on a pier in a harbor town. Basically, it's the oldest still functioning restaurant of its kind in the Commercial Street area. 
Sit at an old fashioned table along the perimeter of the building or at the large U shaped bar. The cocktails we had were FANTASTIC! Alaskan King Crab, steamers, lobster, all well cooked and delicious!
After having had a couple poor experiences here a few years ago, I was decided to give it another try during the summer 2018 (went three times!) and was VERY pleasantly surprised! Will definitely be back!"
813,"Outstanding meal at low-key J's Oyster. The restaurant was packed, mostly with locals. You can tell it's a popular place! All the food was fresh and fantastic - from the oysters to the steamers to the lobster, it was the sweetest seafood I've had. Very delicious. The other entrees were excellent too, including the seafood casserole, baked to perfection, and the lobster pernod pasta."
814,"Love this place!!!! The best sea food I've ever tried so far! 
The place itself a bit small and normally packed so you have to wait in line. As for the food and drinks it's very good variety, amazing desert! Attentive stuff and very friendly atmosphere. Definitely would want to go back if I have a chance!"
815,"After a brisk walking tour of the city, our tour guide recommended J's for oysters and great seafood.  Brianna took care of us after a short wait by the bar.  We had the oyster sampler which gives you several different oyster options.  The clam chowder and the lobster roll were very good.  My wife had the lobster stew which is really more of a bisque and she loved it.

If ever in Portland give them a visit after seeing the Longfellow house."
816,"I came here on a friend's recommendation, and I'm glad I did. The food is quite good for a really tiny place by the water.  Their $28 lobster dinner, which I had for lunch (no it's never too early for lobster dinner) was definitely worth it. I loved how sweet the lobster meat was, and the steamed clams that came with it were delicious! Their lobster sandwich was quite good as well. We definitely enjoyed it.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their New England clam chowder. It was just a tad bit salty.  It did not seem as if it were cooked the same day.

The view definitely made our dining experience even more memorable.  The view of the water, boats, and the harbor was simply breathtaking, even in the winter.  I would love to go back in the summer, during their happy hour, in which they bring out free oysters to customers. 

A couple of tips for folks who are thinking of trying it out: When going for lunch, go as early as possible. Despite arriving a little bit past 12 pm, I still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. The mimosas are quite strong."
817,"The seafood is so fresh. I had the lobster + steamed clams for $32 & the oyster sampler. Both were amazing choices! I come from California where a lobster alone is $45+! The long necked steamed clams were delicious. I've never peeled my own clams before. I honestly didn't even know they had ""skin"" it was quite an interesting experience. I highly recommend the lobster & steamed clams platter. It's perfect. The lobster was cooked perfectly & Not enough!! The meat came right out & we had a female lobster with my favorite, eggs! I would definitely come back for seconds. Will most likely visit again before this trip is over."
818,Great little hide-away...best seafood I've tasted in Portland. Will be back again for sure.
819,"Came here on a recommendation from a friend as long as I was looking for seafood and cold beer. When the weather is nice it's tough to get a seat outside, and inside is limited to a bar and limited surrounding seats. But the food is worth the wait. A bucket of steamers, some oysters rockefeller and a lobster roll split between two was more than enough. Local beers on tap as well. Great spot!"
820,"Great customer service, locals present and freshest seafood you could ask for.  I will be back."
821,"Initially, my party wanted to try Eventide Oysters, but the line was ridiculously long. We walked around and came across this place with an outdoor seating. It was a 30min wait, so we thought we'd give it a try, but boy I wish would've just waited for Eventide instead of coming here...

Service: Fairly quick & very friendly, BUT an automatic 20% tip included?!? Ridiculous.

Raw Oysters: Very skinny, not a lot of meat. VERY dirty, like...VERY. I don't think they clean it. I would not recommend this at all.

Steamed Clams: Different than the normal clams I'm used to but not necessarily a bad different. These remind me Geo Duck clams. They're pretty darn good, but it's a lot of work to get the sand out.

Lobster Pernod: The highlight of my meal! Very generous with the lobster meat. The pasta is very creamy and has a strong mushroom taste. This comes with coleslaw or salad, but ps: the salad doesn't come with dressing. It's a very sad salad.."
822,Great place right on the harbor. Some of the best steamer I've ever had. Don't know what you did to them but keep it up! Just a good low key friendly place. Service was great. I dropped a mussel in my beer and server came back and gave me a fresh one. Prices are very reasonable. Lobster casserole is a must! And I love that you get even more steamers with the lobster dinner. Definitely coming back when I'm back visiting family.
823,"I enjoyed the food I ordered as did my companion. Crab stuffed mushrooms were amaaaazing!! Large portion for $12ish.  The half dozen Maine oysters were the star of the evening. Plump, flavorful, fresh. The seafood casserole was fine, but it was the seafood bouillabaisse that had great flavor. 

A little pricey but a good Old Port tourist stop."
824,"Fabulous. If you're seeking an authentic Maine lobster experience, you're in the right place. Simple and true. Great local crowd, ambience and good drinks. My martini came with a sidecar."
825,"From raving recommendations & the simple fact that the Travel God, Anthony Bourdain did a segment here, J's was top of the list for Maine eats. It did not disappoint! While it seems simple, the only thing simple is the undeniable freshness. 

We ordered a bakers dozen of oysters (Maine & Virginia). They were incredible! We also got the crab leg/steamer clam meal. The clams were unique & delicious. There is a method to eating, which you need to hear first-hand from the bartender/waitress. Washed it all down with local Alagashes"
826,"3.5 rounded up. lobster dinner + lobster roll.

lobster dinner comes with steamers on the plate + corn (we were substituted with cole slaw) The lobster meat was so sweet and juicy, and was a solid reminder why lobster is the most famous product of maine to the out of state visitors. Steamers were delicious as well - even though you had to work to remove the skin and rinse, it was well worth it.

Lobster roll wasn't the best as the bread that was served was very crusty. Most of the bites tasted of bread and butter, and you would get hints of lobster throughout.

All in all, a great local spot with charming, old-school vibe. I could see myself doing a lobster dinner with an allagash during the summer time outside.."
827,"This place is gross, the health department shut it down a while ago due to what I thought was unsanitary condition but after a nasty message by someone that obviously works there or owns the place maybe that wasn't the case. But I did google the place and saw the owner owed a million dollars in back taxes and was sentenced to four months in jail. So if you're not willing to pay your taxes what other things don't you do, ie like clean the place. I will never eat here again and there's better oyster options in Portland. It's a huge pain to get a table here as everyone flocks to this place in the summer. I recommend Lobster Co. If you want seafood and a seat outside. *side note I have no personal relationship with anyone at Lobster Co. It's simply the better spot and many will agree with me. So to the person who sent me a douchey message and then blocked me, mind your business!"
828,"There are many excellent restaurants in Portland Maine, there is only one J's.  Old school on the harbor, local, casual, friendly, good.  It may be a bit rough around the edges for some, but that is its charm for most.  It's been here forever, hole in the wall serving steamers, lobsters and all kind of local seafood, like the seafood casserole I had tonight.
Lots of people know each other here, but they still smile and say hi when I walk in!  Kind of like a Maine Cheers, for those of you old enough to know that reference! Definitely a good off the beaten path destination for great seafood!"
829,"Wow!  I was looking for a local favorite with fresh seafood and I found it here.  It was packed on a Thursday night, but we didn't wait long to sit.  We started with oysters (of course), and they were so great and shucked well with very little sand/shell.
For dinner I had a full lobster, and at $36, I thought was reasonable for a restaurant price.  It came over clams and a corn on the cob, and was so fresh and nice and hot.  I washed everything down with a local brewery beer, Allagash white.
Everything was so wonderful, I wish I had gotten double of it all!  Definitely more locals than tourists here, so you know you are in the right place.  Can't wait to visit again when I am in town again!"
830,"Decent seafood shack by the port with affordable prices. Their oysters are not the cleanest (a few of mine still had some sand in them), but you won't get sick from eating them. For the price ($26 for a baker's dozen mix of Maine and Virginia oysters), it's pretty worth it.

My boyfriend and I also shared the Lobster Dinner, which consisted of a 1.5 pound lobster, steamers, and a corn on the cob. Great value for the price.

The only downside is that they don't take reservations - it's first come, first serve. Luckily, we beat the dinner rush and only had to wait about 25 minutes for a table so definitely try to come early if you can."
831,"The oysters here were phenomenal. I did a bit of math and each piece was going to be 2.60-2.80 a piece depending on if we got a half dozen or dozen. We got a dozen, but the size of the Maine oysters were huge. I did not realize they could come in this size. We also got a clam chowder which was alright, I've had better and this one we had to add a bit of salt and pepper to. 

I'm really knocking a star off due to the waiting. They said 20 mins to a couple in front of us and they waited 45+... We were promised 45 mins and that was a bit more accurate. Would come here again for their oysters when it's not so busy."
832,I just tried the raw scallop cocktail and it was really fresh and sweet. I think you have to be really on your game to offer raw scallops. They turn so quickly (just try it with scallops from the supermarket...). Just one more feather in the cap of an authentic local place.
833,"Unfortunately this was one of the very few restaurants that were able to accommodate for my party of 10 on a Saturday night in Portland Maine over the summer. That was a mistake on our part since we didn't do prior research. We got seated outside on the dock with two tables joined together. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees. Everything was really bland for me and I felt like the shellfish weren't cleaned enough because I ate a lot of sand. The salad came out and it was the saddest salad I ever seen. They literally placed dressing packages on top of our salad - I felt like I was eating a cafeteria lunch in high school. I was expecting the salad to be dressed. Was I missing something here? They could've had a bad night here, but based on what I had, I would not recommend this restaurant."
834,"This was not good! We sat at the bar and it took a bit of time for anyone to take our order,  even though it was not busy. We wanted oysters...they were warm not cold.  Served basically on a plate. We went to many other places and had far superior oysters and seafood. The best thing about the place is the location during summer"
835,"This was the last restaurant my girlfriends and I ate at before heading to the airport during my best friend's bachelorette trip. We all wanted that last lobster roll and steamer clams! I got a bucket of steamers and half a dozen of oysters. I had tried the steamer clams at other restaurants and definitely wanted to get some more in before leaving. 

We had to wait a little bit for a table because it was a Saturday and I believe we saw a lot of kids in graduation gowns at the restaurant with their families. There is inside and outside seating -- we chose to sit outside because the weather was nice. 

The service was alright, but our waitress had a really bad attitude. I know it was busy, but she made a side comment that was unnecessary the second my friends and I sat down. 

Overall, the food was delicious and was a nice last meal in Portland."
836,"Looked at Yelp reviews and recommendations from Airbnb host to chose to have our Maine Lobster dinner here. We were all disappointed. The wait wasn't too bad for 6:30 on a Tuesday evening, about 35 minutes. This is small quaint place with the bar and counter through the middle.  Paper placemats were put down on our damp table and with cheap looking silverware. Our server was a blonde in her 50's. She never told us her name....no common courtesy whatsoever. Took drink orders quickly. 3 of us had water served in plastic disposal glasses and my husband had a local Shipyard beer that he enjoyed.  We all wanted the steamed lobster special with corn. Came with clams, but none of us really wanted. Server was just plain unfriendly when telling us there was no corn. What??? But it was more for a salad and they would take off $4 if we didn't get the clams. Guys chose to go ahead and get them and we had the cole slaw. It was the only good thing about the meal. Two also had side salads with packaged dressing. Lobsters were very hot but full of water and very little meat. The melted butter tasted funny after awhile and we stopped dipping. The guys said the clams were very sandy. Server said to dip in the broth. They did but still didn't like them. Our friend is from the west coast of Oregon and knows clams. All and all, a very disappointing dinner."
837,"This is the reason you visit Maine, for a nice hearty lobster meal, and J's Oyster was one of the best lobster meals my fiance and I ever had!

There were a ton of restaurants that served lobster in Portland, to no one's surprise, and seemingly they were all very similar according to the online reviews. However, what drew us to J's were the positive reviews about the quality of their food and the fact it was truly a restaurant first. 

My fiance and I dropped in for dinner at around 6:15pm on a recent Saturday evening and waited for about 40 minutes for a table, which wasn't that bad. There was the choice of either eating indoors or in their small outdoor area. We chose indoors because it was a bit chilly/windy outside. The indoor dining space was tight and dim. The bar was smack dab in the middle of the room and tables aligned the walls, but all of the tables seated at least 4 so there was plenty of space for the 2 of us.

We already knew what we wanted, which was the lobster entree, but we decided to take it a step further and go all out by ordering multiple appetizers. And go all out we did, as even the waitress was taken aback by how many dishes we ordered! Here's the rundown:

NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER - A bit too watered down for our liking. There was plenty of potatoes and clams inside, but the chowder was not thick enough.

LOBSTER STEW - Same issue as the chowder as the stew was very thin and a bit watered down. It could have used more thickening. However, we were surprised at how much lobster meat was inside, which we really appreciated and was fine by us!

OYSTER SAMPLER (Raw, Baked, Stuffed, Rockefeller, and Mornay) - Unfortunately, there was only 1 oyster of each, but every single one was delicious. Actually, our waitress saw that there was 2 of us, so she gave us an extra raw oyster, which was super nice of her. All of the oysters were fantastic and the cooked ones were perfectly done.

COMBO SEAFOOD COCKTAIL (Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Raw Scallops, and Raw Oysters) - All of the seafood was so fresh and really to die for. It was everything we wanted wrapped up in one appetizer dish. It definitely wet our appetite and set us up for what was to come.

LOBSTER ROLL - Other than the chowder and stew, maybe the other disappointment of the night. Disappointment might be a strong word though as the lobster meat was refreshing and the bun was toasted to perfection with butter, but it was basically just lobster meat on a toasted bun. No extra seasoning or mayo mixed in. In fact, there was a packet of Hellman's mayo on the plate for customers who wanted to smother some on their lobster. We preferred if the lobster was seasoned and mayo'd up for us. Also, included in the dish were a pickle and some ruffle chips. This is probably the one dish I wouldn't recommend if you go with the lobster dinner.

LOBSTER DINNER (1 1/8 lb lobster) served with steamed clams and corn on the cob - Yes, yes, yes! The plate was as glorious as we had imagined. A huge lobster sitting on a plate of steamed clams and corn on the cob. The lobster was amazingly fresh, as though it had just been caught out of the bay. Every time we cracked a piece of our lobsters, hot water just spilled out oozing of lobster flavor. It was full of meat every which way and perfect. 

On the other hand, the clams needed cleaning. Although they were steamed very well, there was a lot of sand in them and each piece absolutely needed cleaning inside the bowl of water provided on the plate. The corn was OK, nothing to write home about.

We were 100% satisfied with coming to J's Oyster over the competition. It was everything we wanted out of a meal in Portland. There were some hiccups, such as the chowder, stew, lobster roll and steamed clams, but the lobster was what we were here for and it delivered big time. In addition, our waitress was fantastic. She was flying all over the place and apologized that we received our chowder and stew late, but she explained why. We also had a small conversation after our meal about our origins. Overall, a fantastic restaurant to fulfill your lobster dreams!"
838,"This was a little bar style restaurant on the water
Sat by a local that told us what to eat and drink
The drink they pour big shots.  The lobster and clams were great. My wife had the casserole, I think her dish was better. The waiter make you feel right at home"
839,"We must have ordered the wrong items, because we didn't really enjoy anything we had.

1) crab stuffed mushrooms-tasted like detergent
2) oyster sampler-one had cheese, one had too much stuffing, raw was just ok
3) lobster roll had little meat and flavorless

Overall, a big bummer since Anthony b had suggested this place!"
840,"2nd time here, love the vibe 
Amazing!!! Came here by my self and find nice  seat at the bar.
The  sea food is fresh as you can get 
From the ocean to your plate.
Reasonable prices!"
841,"Great historic restaurant right on the water. It doesn't seem like they changed much over the years which adds to its charm. I can totally see why the great late Anthony Bourdain enjoyed the ambiance in there so much. It has a gritty fisherman vibe which provides you a glimpse into what it might have been like working on the docks years and years ago. Their lobster roll was simple, but elegant. Just bun, lettuce, and cold, fresh lobster meat. Great place to go if you want a no-frills lobster roll"
842,"I really enjoyed J Oyster. We went on Saturday, got there just before 6:00 and sat right away (outside seating since it was a nice night). It's not a huge place, but plenty of tables inside and bar is a good size. You can tell it's mostly local sitting inside especially the bar. I can't imagine the turnover is quick. We got oysters to start - so fresh. My friend got the lobster dinner and I had the seafood bouillabaisse, which was delicious! The broth had so much flavor. There was plenty of seafood. I highly recommend it. Our waiter was good too. Overall, service was great and no one rushed us to leave. Good food and atmosphere."
843,"Went to J Oyster and they said thirty minute wait time. Ended up as an hour wait. Guess turning tables equals opportunity cost and not important.  At any rate, the review is all about food quality, service, and distinguish me too if the restaurant.  
The oysters were good same as others nearby.  The clams were good too and like the others nearby as well.  Shrimp Scampi was very good and priced fairly.  Beer selection could be better as the wine selection too.  A great way to increase IAT and margins too."
844,"This place is fine if you want quick seafood in Portland. It's right on the water, there is both indoor and outdoor seating, and appears to be very popular with locals. The service was good, our waitress was really sweet and wanted to make sure we were happy. I felt bad because someone I was with was rude to our waitress due to the quality of their salad, (who goes to a place like this and orders a salad?!) but she kept smiling and kept providing excellent service. The menu options were very traditional for a hole in the wall seafood place. The seafood casserole was very good, as was the cheesecake for dessert. I wouldn't necessarily come back right away, I would try some other locations first, but it gave a good feel for the culture of Portland!"
845,"Comfortable atmosphere, friendly service and fresh seafood.  The Seafood casserole, lobster stew and baked oysters are our go to's.  The bar tenders make a great strong drink as well.  There is a reason it can be hard to get a table at J's, though our favorite time of year to visit is in the winter because of the warm vibes."
846,"Wife and I visiting from Texas, heard about J's from the locals.  Was looking for a place to have steamed seafood. Great restaurant on the pier.  Fresh as they come.  Lobster with steamers for me, King crab and steamers for her.  Everything was delicious, some grit in the steamers even after washing as they recommended but thinking that comes with eating clams.  Would have preferred some corn with our meal.  Great service and we'll be back."
847,"Loved this place. You can eat outside by the water or go inside where it is really busy. I had 1/2 dozen combo oysters and their special for $32.00 whole lobster, clams and an ease of corn.  Delicious. Excellent food fun atmosphere.  I would definetely go back."
848,"The raw oysters here were very good and they quickly came to us. However, the meal seemed to go downhill from there. The Oysters Rockefeller had way too much topping, masking the fact that there were even oysters in there. The bucket of steamed clams was large and cooked well, however we could never seem to get the grit taste out of them - we even heard someone tell the waitress that they were grittier than normal. The next part was what I was most excited about and was highly recommended by our waitress - the Seafood Casserole and the Mac and Cheese. Unless you want Haddock casserole with one bite of every other seafood, I'd steer clear of this dish. The fact that a majority of this was just fish and breadcrumbs made us feel ripped off on this $28 dish. When I saw the $7 side of baked Mac and Cheese, I knew it had to be great for that price. We were disappointed with the flavorless, thin cheese sauce. 

I would recommend this place for the raw oysters, but not much more. It is on the water and has decent priced drinks, but the food was definitely not worth the over $100 bill."
849,"Open since 1977., I'll start with that. The staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and lets face it, like a local. Our late lunch was excellent. Maine Oysters, clam chowder, and split lobster roll."
850,"This is my first stop off the plane.

Best seafood in town. Go eat where the locals eat! Order the lobster chowder.

Enjoy!"
851,"When you're by the pier, you know you're at risk for paying tourist prices. I contemplated a long time reading reviews for many of the restaurants before settling for Js. 

Js doesn't have any grand decor. In fact, it really can use a makeover inside and furniture upgrade. However, service was really good. Very happy and bright people. 

I ordered the lobster stew, lobster roll, and haddock sandwich. I skipped the steamer since I saw reviews talking about the steamers having sand in it. Really not a fan of sandy shellfish. The lobster roll is not bad although I've had better. You do get claw meat and not mixed and shredded meat. The lobster stew was a let down for me. I guess I wasn't expecting the taste of alcohol in it. I wish I tried the clam chowder instead. The lobster stew is pricey too at $12.5 a cup versus $7 for clam chowder. The highlight for me was the haddock sandwich. I almost missed this on the menu. Not until I was ordering that I saw it. The waitress immediately said that the haddock sandwich is her favorite. The fish filet was breaded and fried just right. The batter wasn't too thick and wasn't soggy at all. The fish was moist and with just a schmear of tartar sauce, the sandwich is just perfect. 

I would've given Js 5 stars but the lobster stew was just not good. Other than that, I think Js is a solid choice for a Portland lunch!"
852,"Great little waterfront 'dive' (I say that lovingly!) with terrific food and great service. Every visitor definitely needs to experience this little jewel. Delighted to find Va and Maine oysters on a shared platter! Fun to compare and taste the difference! Definitely a 'locals' joint... but the wait-staff was very patient & sweet with newbies who had never personally cracked a lobster. We watched as our waitress entertained her customers with how easy it was to get into their lobster and clams. A ""must"" for our-of-Towner's."
853,Slightly pricey in my opinion. Oysters were okay but not outstanding. I'm sure in summer it's great just a little chilly inside this week.
854,"A solid spot for oysters with a nice outdoor ambiance on the water. The inside of the restaurant leaves a bit to be desired and is much older and feels like a pub. We were also a bit surprised that they only offered oysters from 2 regions, Portland or Virginia. That being said the oysters were very good. They also keep their chowder and soups in a fridge by the main bar and you can see them spooning it and warming in a microwave near the door to the restaurant. This just seemed like something that should be done back in the kitchen outside of view from the customers. Service was friendly and quick."
855,"Ate here during our Portland stop on New England cruise for lunch. Busy place. Waited 35 minutes for table. I was tasting lobster rolls on all of our New England stops. I personally would rate theirs number two, the one   I had in Boston #1,. Both were excellent. Would definitely stop here again. Service very good, very friendly wait staff"
856,"Four adults and one four-year-old showed up at 5:30 PM for dinner. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait. Turned out to be 50 minutes. It was raining slightly so we stood inside the tiny restaurant which was very noisy. The bar is the biggest thing in the place and the seating is quite limited. Their clam chowder was good although a little light on clams. The lobster rolls were good although not outstanding. My meal was so unmemorable that now only two days later, I can't remember what I had.

The decent food just couldn't make up for the long wait, noisiness, and the small seating area"
857,"Go here!  You will accomplish the Maine trilogy oysters, clams, and lobster.  Great atmosphere.  The food was excellent.  They also have corn on the cob - for those who were wondering."
858,"Our first stop in Maine for true fresh shellfish! Small and quaint, super friendly bartenders and staff. My husband wants to go back b4 we leave Maine. Got the steamer clams, oysters and local pumpkin beer! A must stop for everyone!"
859,Our Uber driver suggested this place when we were on our way to a tour. Don't go during lunch or dinner time because you're going to be waiting at a 45-60 min wait. We came back around 3:30 and were seated right away. The oysters are extremely fresh and yummy. I suggest the combo so that you can try both types of oysters. The steamed clam was very delicious too! Our waiter even taught us how to properly eat and peel the clams.
860,"Expect a wait if you come here. It's clearly a popular spot and for such a large menu they do most of it pretty well.

The mussels were the star item on the menu here if you ask me. The broth was PERFECT, buttery and garlicy with just the right amount of acid. The oysters were nice as well-- please take a hint from the name, people  They weren't the cheapest around. But for a restaurant on the ocean, they were good.

Lobster was alright. Not the best. I'd hold out for lobster at another location if you have the time. Shrimp was solid. Clam chowder was pretty good too.

Maybe not quite worth the hype, but if you'd like to snag a spot in line and grab some local brews while you wait, go ahead and check it out!"
861,"On a hot Saturday afternoon we wandered over after docking at a nearby marina. Only a 10 minute wait for a table (the line quickly grew). Yet for a place that celebrates oysters they only had two varieties (one from Virginia, one local). Who would pick the Virginia oysters (which were cheaper despite the transport)? The Maine were okay, but not as good as oysters we'd had the previous night in K-port, or had later at Eventide. Yes, we've eaten too many oysters, but J not that good."
862,"Came here for some snacks. I opted for the Maine oysters and my sister got the crab stuffed mushrooms, which she loved especially since they were okay to eat with her gluten allergy. Our server was super nice and accommodating to us splitting our checks in a weird way."
863,"Love this divey little place.  They have Guinness and good steamer clams.  Very small place on the inside has been lively every time I have visited.

We just stopped in for steamers on this visit so there isn't much more to review.  But if my memory serves me correctly, the prices of steamers has risen considerably since the last time I came to visit.  Not sure of its the time of year or other environmental factors but I still had a good time."
864,"I visited here a few years ago and it was awesome. It was recommended by some locals at the airport. Today I cannot give it 5 stars because of the waitress. She has a very nasty attitude and is not friendly. This is not someone you want to serve your dinner. Adding to this, she brought the wrong appetizer(could have been for another table or she just wrote our order wrong). We told her that's not what we ordered; she gave us the nasty look and said: ""I'm sure I heard you guys said that you want this twice"". That automatically changed our mood so we settled for just one drink each and ate and left as fast as possible. It's possible that she was having a bad day or maybe she is just a nasty person.
The food on the other hand is still good so that's why I'm giving 3 stars. On my previous visit I can say we had one of the best Lobster Mac & Cheese. Today we had the Lobster Roll and Broiled Haddock. I will gladly return but I'm sure to remember this waitress and avoid her by all means."
865,"Oh man what happened to our delicious lobster stew [insert cryface emoji]? It used to taste excellent, but now just tastes like tons of lobster in a bowl of warm milk and butter+lobster shell stock+ some hint of bitter sherry (brandy? cognac? If someone figures it out, please let me know). Still quite enjoyable, just missing the goodness of yesteryears. We always love talking to the locals at the old-timey bar, having a glass of happy hour wine with our stews. Lovely views of the bay and the smell of the salty air still makes this unpretentious place a charm on our Maine list."
866,"I know all we have different tastes but I'm an Asian. So we might have different tastes. And this is my opinion about this restaurant. The points I give for them is: 
Foods : 7/10.
Drinks: 8/10.
Service: 8/10."
867,"We ended up here on a pretty busy day (Old Port Festival), but we were able to saddle up to the bar and get prompt service. Fresh tasty oysters with all the fixins, and a lobster salad (comes with cole slaw, potato salad, and some chopped carrots/onions on a bed of lettuce.) Decent size serving of lobster, and all tasted great."
868,"Small restaurant on the pier. More locals than tourists. Lobster soup/stew was just a ton of lobster in a bisque like broth, no filler ingredients. Excellent."
869,"It breaks my heart to leave a bad review for this establishment. I come for the fresh seafood everytime I visit. This visit was terrible. A waitress named Jackie was serving us, a party of 5. Her attitude towards us the entire meal ruined the experience for my sister and her family. When the drinks where bought over to the table, my youngest nephew held onto the plastic cup a bit too hard and her immediately respond was so nasty; with the most attitude in her voice ""don't hold it like that."" I don't believe anyone should have the right to parent kids that are not theirs. She also proceeded to add a 20% gratuity to our check, but when my sister paid with a credit card, she had the audacity to ask if she wanted to leave ""a tip"". Excuse me miss, but was the 20% gratuity you've added to our check not enough? 

I ordered a few items only because I wanted them to try it first then get additional orders of things they liked. Her attitude made is want to leave. We ended up eating elsewhere with better service. 

Did I forget to mention she didn't even come around to our table to check on us? No napkins, no refills of water. I have never been this disappointed by your establishment. It's time to check on your staff."
870,"This was a delicious and beautiful dining experience.
We sat out side the view was amazing. Our server Sandy was awesome! So pleasant and friendly. We observed her showing a guest how to enjoy steamers. 
Our clam and haddock chowders were delicious as was our lobster rolls .
We will be back!"
871,"My favorite was the muscles- the sauce was so good and after you finish the muscles you can dip the side bread in it. It's filled with garlic  The baked oysters were also phenomenal. 

The restaurant itself does feel like a dive bar inside, I would probably sit outside on the patio near the water next time. 

This places doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait or take a seat at the bar."
872,"For our last meal before heading home, we wanted to each have a whole lobster. 

I started off with the Lobster stew ($12.5 for a small cup) but it wasn't good at all! It literally tasted like they just put a few pieces of lobster in cream and called it a soup.

For our Steamed Lobster dinner, the MP was $28 and it came with corn and steamed clams. The corn was very bland and the steamed clams had sand in most of them. 

Also, our food took a while to come out. We overheard the waitress take another table's order after taking ours and she asked if they would like some bread while they waited but she never offered us any bread when she took our order.

There are so many better options in Maine, I would go elsewhere. The quality of the food just doesn't justify their prices. The only reason I can think of to come here is for the harbor view in the summer time but it was too cold when we came to even think about sitting outside."
873,"Yes, we visited J Oyster because Bourdain loved it so much. But the bucket of steamers was really very very good. I've never had steamers that way before, and they show you how to do it properly and the steamers are really plump and fresh. We also had a dozen raw oysters  that were decent and baked stuffed oysters with lobster stuffing (but really barely any lobster was involved). Overall it is a fantastic place for steamers, but as an oyster bar, I prefer The Shop environment on Washington St - just much more sunny, airy, and spacious. It is a bit dark and gritty here."
874,The lobster stew was amazing!!!! Got off a boat ride on a chilly night and was looking for something to help warm up! Would recommend this place to anyone!!!
875,"After doing some research, we decided to try this place while in Portland, Maine. We all ordered lobster rolls (first lobster rolls we've ever had) and we were absolutely not disappointed. The chilled lobster on a warm buttered bun with melted butter was AMAZING! The view was incredible and they had a nice selection of local beers. The waitstaff was super friendly and helpful with the menu as well as local attractions to go see. I'd highly recommend this place if you're ever in Portland."
876,We went to another restaurant for lobster. But we feel that restaurant is not that good. So we search for another place. Then we end up at J's Oyster. The Maine oyster is so fresh and also the service is really good. You might need to wait for a table but the line run fast.
877,I've only been here for oysters and drinks - but both were great. I'll definitely be back. I liked the oyster shooter the bartender recommended us. Delicious!
878,Lived on the coast forever.  Never came here because it looked like a tourist trap.  So wrong.  I went on the advice of our departed Anthony bourdain.  RIP.  He could not have been more right.  YOU WILL WAIT.  Its totally worth it.  The service is friendly and quick.  The food.  YUMMY.  We have just the regular haddock filet.  It was like your mom from Maine made it.  So delish!  I had oysters and they were tasty and fresh.  I'm so pleased that I finally decided to go.  I recommend this place highly!
879,"A pretty small, and low key place. We sat at the bar and ordered oysters and they were awesome! I had a lobster roll and my husband had their Rueben sandwhich. Everything was fresh and delicious! Great spicy bloody Mary's as well. Can't wait to go back!"
880,"I've dined at J's or hung out for drinks there for years.  J's is a Portland institution and is one of the places I always suggest when people are looking for somewhere authentic.  J's is definitely a ""hole in the wall"" where you can get some pretty amazing seafood.  They are known for their oysters for sure yet try their bouillabaisse, which is amazing as well as their seafood casserole.  If you want to rub elbows with locals and fishermen and looking for somewhere that's totally unpretentious give J's a try; you won't be disappointed."
881,"We had the Maine oysters, good but small (had better Maine oysters in Washington DC). 
Then tried the steamers....yuck, full of sand. Server said ""it happens"" and did remove it from our bill. Overall, just ok."
882,Place was pretty full and waiter came up to us and we thought he was a customer.  The raw oysters were good but the stuffed were a tease as they were different sizes and weren't close. Shrimp scampi was fine though maybe a little too much oil.  Decor was casual probably would have been better outside seating.  Overall not a great experience.
883,"Such  great staff.   The best mussels and oysters and chowder we've found in Portland.  Go around 4pm to get a great seat outside, it gets busy around dinner."
884,"For a 3rd stop on your family trip through New England, Portland was #3.  We checked out seafood market and the guys working their recommended J's.  For oysters, no matter where they are from, as long as they are fresh and cold I don't think a server can mess them up.  We ordered a dozen and they were fresh.  I ordered, 2 orders, of the Rockefellers. Imagine taking a fresh oyster putting some frozen spinach and a little red bell pepper and plopping it on top, making it almost warm (from frozen)  then saying ""here ya go"".  We left J's with a very bad taste and a bill that didn't match."
885,"Came here on a Friday night at 1030pm and the first thing we were greeted by the bartender was ""sure you can sit but you have to order in 5 mins!""

We were hungry from our 7-hour drive from NYC so we knew exactly what we wanted. But we should've seen that as a sign of bad customer service when Yelp listed closing time of midnight.

Once we were seated, we had to remind the bartender again for the menu as the clock was ticking! The waitress finally showed up after a while and told us we now have 3 mins.  

We ordered the lobster roll and clam chowder.  Lobster roll was decent but it was our first in Maine so now looking back (after having gone to Bar Harbor and Trenton), this place was mediocre at best.  Clam chowder was disappointing, mostly potato and very little clams.

Also the bar area occupies a very large part of the restaurant. So definitely come here at night if you want to hear some shouting matches from the locals."
886,"Ok..came here a while ago and the steamers were very gritty.  Thinking maybe they improved their process, I decided to come back again.  Mistake.  Still gritty as last time...ugh...
Service was good and friendly and good selection of local beers.  Menu has a good selection of food but I'm done coming here for steamers."
887,Small dive joint but soooo good! Make sure to try the steamers and the lobster stew! Also had the Lobster roll which was perfect size after appetizers. Fiancé had the bouillabaisse which had great flavor and lots of seafood just wish it had a bit more lobster. Locals come here to eat if that tells you anything. Place is legit.
888,This is my favorite oyster bar in Portland.  The food is always fresh and amazing taste!
889,"Came here on a Sunday night and waited 30 minutes for outdoor seating. Indoor seating was around 1.5-2 hrs. We ordered the bakers dozen oyster ($21) and it was super fresh, although not sweet. The lobster dinner came with 1 1/4 lb lobster, steamers and corn on the cob. Lobster was juicy and succulent and best of all the POPCORN BUTTER that it came with was amazing with the lobster !"
890,"1.  The perfect combination of view and delicious food. 
2.  I ordered the lobster stew. I have been thinking about it ever since. Creamy and light with tons of big chunks of lobstah and delicious broth with layers of flavor. 
3.  Service was absolutely the best. Our waitress was funny and had a great sense of humor.... she laughed at my jokes...
4.   Will go back before we leave."
891,"Poorly shucked and near room temp Oysters, inattentive service. Clam chowder was ok, but not review worthy.
J's was recommended by a few locals, who suggested we cozy up to the bar for a drink and seafood. The walkways were tight, making standing around to wait for the bar less appealing than an available table. This might have been a mistake!
Table service was slow and we had to wait, menus closed, for 15 min to place an order to a waitress who would not be bothered (later asks for more beverage and Tabasco would be managed directly at the bar.)
Short answer, don't bother."
892,"Nice staff
Good food!
Lobsters sizes and tastes are a little different depending on what month you visit. My personal favorite time was June! It was when lobsters are the biggest"
893,Horrible!  Got seated right away but sat for 20 min plus while waitress kept walking by...  locals we were not.  Walked out in disappointment.   Don't get a second chance at first impression
894,"Amazed!!  With seafood allergies, this place is the best for separating their cooking for folks like me. Great customer service, great food. Small but sat on patio but real family atmosphere. So much food and fun forgot to take a pic."
895,"Service was great but the food sucked. Scampi tasted like they added too much wine, Alfredo sauce tasted bland, and the crab filled mushrooms was just horrible. The food was terrible, so unless you're just getting oysters I wouldn't expect good food. Btw bathrooms were foo foo"
896,Very good. Happened upon this place walking around Portland. Place was busy with an hour wait. We got a couple seats at the bar. Grab them when you can. Had dozen Maine oysters and some clam chowder. Very good. Will visit again. It will is a dive bar. But that's what we liked about it.
897,"The waitress we had that wore a ball cap was super friendly and attentive!! I really enjoyed her presence

Ordered half a dozen oyster, cup of clam chowder, large bucket of clams and side of potato salad.

The oysters were big and delicious. Super tasty!!! Highly recommend.

The clam chowder was full of flavor, but too liquidy for me. If it was just a bit more thick, it would have been perfect but it was like watery soup then a chowder. 

The large clams for 2 of us was a bit too much for us to finish. Lol, but it was great. Couldn't really taste the butter so I asked for lemon on the side and dipped it with that.

Potato salad was bland so add salt and pepper and it'll be super refreshing. The hint of scallion slices in there was yummy.

Enjoy!"
898,"We came here for oysters, steamers, and beer around happy hour time. We sat outside which had really great views. It's a pretty small place overall and I hear the wait is really long during peak time. Our waitress was great and we really enjoyed it!"
899,The wait was a bit long for seating outside. Once we were seated our waitress was very efficient and friendly. My spouse had the lobster stew which was chunky with lobster meat and shared a order of stuffed mushrooms which was. bit dry. I had small salad before my meal while edible was not very appealing. We shared the seafood meal with tomato sauce and shelled pasta underneath. It was very tasty meal. The views of the water was calming but that day slightly chilly. The outside was disability friendly for those with mobility challenges. I highly recommend J's Oyster for a meal.
900,"Went here last weekend and had the best time, the oysters, the staff and the vibes were on point. The staff had phenomenal knowledge of their product and bent over backward to make sure our experience was nothing but the best. 

This friendly restaurant is a must see in Portland, ME. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm up there"
901,"Came here last night for the first time and had a great experience - the warm, friendly and knowledgeable service are without a doubt 5 stars! This one is a difficult 4.5 for me because of the price. Individual oysters are $2.50, or 6 for $15 and a dozen for $29. I believe this is the same as Eventide and Central Provisions, which in my book are pricey places. If I didn't know about The Shop (oyster joint on Washington Ave where oysters are $1.50/each or $18/dozen), it wouldn't have occurred to me that cheaper is possible. But back to the things to love about Maine Oyster Co!:

-walked in a little before 5pm on Saturday and were the first ones here. SUPER friendly service - the guys behind the counter were eager to explain the menu and the really cool map on their wall displaying the origin of the current selection.
-we were difficult and asked if we could do the dozen, but start with 2 of each and then pick our favorite and get one more each of those to total a dozen (since 5 varieties were on offer), and they were more than happy to oblige!
-prosecco on tap! (I'm loving this trend)
-they gave us their special on the house!! (Oyster with spicy sauce and a shot of prosecco), very generous of them, I think bc it was would our first time here.
-LOVED the cozy, warm wooden nautical interior with light strung everywhere.

They do have more non-oyster food on offer here than The Shop, but the Shop has significantly cheaper oysters and more wines/beer options on tap, but a less cozy atmosphere. I would definitely come back but not as frequently as I'll be able to patron The Shop for the price different. This is an exciting addition to the neighborhood, though!"
902,"Tonight I yelped ""oysters"" and saw that while this restaurant only had 3 reviews, they were all great. I decided to give it a try and was completely blown away! After a week in Maine, and many oysters eaten, these were by far the best. The flavor and plating, prices, and atmosphere were all great. The food was delicious and was plated creatively. The prices were very reasonable too, $15/half dozen oysters, $29/dozen. However, there was a platter with 6 oysters, a great lobster roll, and a cup of clam chowder for only $33.. this is the best deal we've seen all week and left two of us satisfied after ordering Oyster/Prosecco shooters and another half dozen because the oysters were just so good! The decor and set up of the restaurant was amazing. Parking was easy to find, the inside has a very trendy feel, and there was an awesome map to show where each type oyster was from - so cute! The staff was very helpful and friendly. 

I wish I lived in Portland so I could be a regular here. I couldn't recommend this restaurant enough - I set up my account just to write a review about this restaurant. A definite must in Portland!"
903,"The seafood is so fresh, definitely a contender for Eventide Oyster Company. I recommend every single oyster, the clam chowder, lobster roll, and the lobster crostini."
904,"We celebrated a birthday at Maine Oyster Company with some ""regulars"" and loved everything about our experience, including: the warmth of the owner and staff, the presentation of our appetizers, the selection of beers (on tap and bottled) and wines, the atmosphere, and, of course, the OYSTERS! The space is cozy without feeling cramped, even as busy as it was when we arrived. It's classy and modern with a rustic feel. If you're a local and haven't been yet, GO, and if you are visiting Portland, Maine Oyster Company is a ""must do"" experience! We live 45 minutes away and now have a new incentive to visit more often!"
905,"Awesome place
Great oysters, great lobster rolls, great service, prosecco, & local brew for the beer lovers but the Maine Blueberry Mignonette was just an amazing taste sensation."
906,"Love love love this fun little oyster bar off the beaten path of downtown Portland. Very simple menu- a variety of local oysters, chowder, and lobster rolls. You go there for the oysters though- and their delicious take on mignonette sauce made with a hint of orange juice and maple syrup. They have a fun dish called the Hot Pearl, which is a shot of Prosecco, and an oyster topped with a spicy mango hot sauce. Very friendly owners who had only been open 2 weeks when we ventured in. They are sponsoring some great oyster tasting events coming up on Thursdays and Fridays in November and December that provide opportunities to sample a wide variety of Maine oysters. They also carry local beers and wines from the local Blue Lobster winery. The space is small and cozy, the perfect spot to slurp down some of the best oysters in the Country!"
907,"Delicious and educational! My wife and I stumbled into this little gem last night. The staff was incredibly welcoming, the food was fresh and delicious, and I kinda understand how to order oysters now! We've been blindly gulping down oysters for years, but this is the first time someone explained why oysters from different areas taste different - basically a sommelier for oysters. Thanks for making our vacation extra delicious!"
908,"Fun place with oysters, what's not to love.  The inside is cozy and people are cool. We had several different local oysters and the owners were really helpful with what to eat."
909,"This place is amazing! Ambience is great, the oysters are fabulous, the service is lovely. A MUST in Portland."
910,"My wife and I are total oyster newbs. John and Libby were so friendly and informative. They walked us through how to do oysters and a new world has now entered my life. Their passion around it is totally inspiring, and the oysters were were way more delicious than I as an oyster amateur thought they would be."
911,"This place is great! Cool spot with super fresh oysters. Everyone who works there is really friendly and knows their stuff. It's nice to get a little backstory on the oysters that you're eating. Went the other night when they had the Allagash tap takeover, which sounds like they plan to make a regular deal with a rotation of local breweries. Excited to go back!"
912,"If I could give this place ten stars I would! Cool vibe, friendly service, and AMAZING food! Got the combo with a half dozen oysters, lobster roll, and clam chowder. All to die for. So much so we ordered seconds! Perfect!"
913,"The oysters were delicious and the staff was amazing! Everyone was so friendly, the atmosphere was perfect!"
914,This place is awesome! Just opened about a month ago and is serving up some really delicious oysters. We tried 2 each of the 6 different types they have right now and each one was excellent. They serve their oysters with this delicious citrusy mignonette as well as some sort of blueberry sauce which was delicious. Owner is super friendly too!
915,"My girlfriend and I went here on a whim although neither of us had oysters before. We were both pleasantly surprised. We each had four (including the ""hot pearl"" with a shot of Prosecco) and also split the cheese plate, lobster crostini, and lobster roll. It was all reasonably priced and delicious.  I'm not usually a fan of lobster rolls with mayonnaise, but this one was very good. Very friendly staff and fun vibe. Highly recommend!"
916,"We're visiting for the weekend from Cape Cod and this is one of our favorite spots so far! We thought Wellfleet oysters were good ... wow! :) Such helpful and kind employees, and these were some of the best, cleanest oysters we've ever tasted, and we're oyster fanatics. Please be sure to stop by. You won't be disappointed!"
917,"I came here on a Saturday night while they had Baxter beer on tap, which was awesome. The atmosphere and staff are friendly and inviting. We had oysters, a lobster roll, and the lobster crostini and all were delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh seafood in Portland. We will be back!"
918,"The parking is free if you dine in which the wait was 30 minutes so we sat at the bar and ended up befriending the bartenders and locals sitting next to us. 
Our bartender made us both an extraordinary old fashion I was super impressed and we ordered the seat tuna as an app and the lazy mans lobster dish which was delicious. No need to get your hands dirty cracking the lobster when all the work was done for me already. 

Thus far the 6 hour drive to eat fresh lobster has been worth it... next lobster rolls"
919,"We hosted a birthday dinner with approximately 16 people and Dimillos handled it with ease. Bob, our waiter, was very nice and helpful. My glass was never empty and the food arrived fairly quickly for such a large group. 

My pasta (seafood alfredo) was a little bland and my friend's scallops were cold, but otherwise everyone enjoyed their food. The meatball appetizer was a standout, it was huge and tasted delicious. 

If you have people visiting from out of town, Dimillos is a good safe choice."
920,"It's really a 3.5/5. A decent choice if you're in the mood for seafood, but overrated.

We called ahead to make a reservation and was told that they were not accepting anymore reservations. We thought that they must be busy tonight (Thursday night at 6:30), but we were prepared to wait a bit. However, when we get to the restaurant, we are seated right away. In fact, the restaurant isn't even half full. Service was still incredibly slow. For drinks, entrees, and dessert - it took ended being two hours. 

Seafood Alfredo - its nothing complex but I admit it was delicious and had enough for leftovers. 

For dessert, I tried to get the gelato of the day but had to pick an alternative when they told me that they didn't have it. I got the creme brulee special instead, which was a mistake. Other than the appearance of the glazed top, it tasted nothing like creme brulee. The texture of custard was extremely watery. The glazed top was overly sweet and entirely made from honey. Please pick something else."
921,"Came here around 7pm on a Friday. An hour wait, as expected on such time of the week. After receiving a waiting beeper, we went to walk around the area. Were called to our table after around 40 mins.
 
There is hourly metered parking on the premises. The restaurant is located on a boat, so you have a bit of a walk from the street, through the massive parking lot, to the parked boat, through the ramp that leads you inside. Cool concept--dinning on a boat and looking outside the window onto the bay. Must be pretty scenic during the day. Even at night, in the darkness, we enjoyed a romantic view of the quiet harbor.
 
We were seated by the window, close to a fireplace. Lovely atmosphere. Dimmed lighting, warm and subdued tones all around. Classy, dark mahogany décor. Relaxed, cozy environment. Pleasant restaurant, suitable for special occasions, family celebrations, or romantic dates.

The service was friendly and courteous. Our waiter did everything to make our experience pleasant and relaxing. Checked in on us just the right amount of times, without over-hovering.
 
Complementary bread and butter were delicious. We were starving, so devoured the first serving and were generously helped to a fresh batch. The butter was tastyyyy--natural and so satisfying on a cold night.
 
New England Clam Chowder ($9.50 for a bowl, $6.50 for a cup) was hearty and filling. Perfect taste and texture. Tons of clam chunks. Definitely get this if you're a seafood/soup lover.
 
Lobster stew ($12 for a cup, $18 for a bowl) was a nice surprise. Buttery taste, a bit unexpected, but a nice change to the usual seafood stew tastes. It contained sooooo much seafood! Filled with tons of lobster chunks, definitely a great bang for your buck!

Frutta Di Mare: Gulf shrimp, Maine lobster, mussels & hot Italian sausage simmered in spicy tomato sauce, served over squid ink pasta with garlic bread ($29) was incredible! HUGE portion. Very hearty and filling. Bursting with flavor. Soooo much delicious seafood, I was a very happy camper! I asked for extra marinara and the waiter brought an entire cup full of sauce! Now that's going above and beyond. Best bang for your buck. Definitely recommend. Would return for this dish anytime!
 
Seafood Alfredo ($29) Jumbo shrimp, lobster and scallops, served over fettucini with Alfredo sauce was solid. Huge portion as well, very filling, impossible to finish in one seating. Delicious sauce and seafood.

The white bottle of wine we got per our waiter's suggestion, was a solid addition to our dinner. Balanced, refreshing taste. Listen to waiter recommendations when ordering alcohol. We didn't finish it and took it to go.

We didn't have space for dessert. Prepare to bring home a lot of leftovers. Overall, not a touristy trap that it seems to be. A solid meal option when visiting Portland."
922,"Visited DiMillo's a few times during a recent business trip. The atmosphere of being on an actual boat on the water was pretty cool especially since I'm from a land locked state. However it would have been better to visit during the day if you want to see out into the bay and the surrounding boats. The three times that I visited it was dark and could not see the surrounding area while dining on the boat. 

While here I tried a variety of different appetizers: Jumbo Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Calamari Bruschetta, and Clam Chowder. Each appetizer was delicious. The Jumbo Shrimp were enormous, seriously the biggest shrimp I've ever had with a Shrimp cocktail. The Bacon Wrapped Scallops were really delicious but were extremely filling especially if you are the only one eating the appetizer. The Calamari Bruschetta was really nicely fried and had a very good flavor in combination with the basil, tomato, and feta cheese. The Clam Chowder was really good but not something I would get again just because the other appetizers I tried were better and I'm not much of a soup guy.

I also tried various entrees during the times I visited. I tried the Lazy Lobster, and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. The Lazy Lobster was really tasty there was a lot of lobster meat in a bowl of butter, I also opted to top my lobster with fresh Maine crab meat, which was also incredible. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was amazing. I literally went back a third time to this restaurant just to order it again. There was a decent amount of lobster and the bread crumbs on top were a nice touch. 

If you are in town and only have the chance to have one meal here do yourself a favor and order the Calamari Bruschetta and the Lobster Mac & Cheese. And to quench your thirst try the Honey Blueberry soda. It's phenomenal."
923,"Had a nice dinner here with friends on our last evening in Portland.
We passed by DiMillo's while in Portland shopping a few times and decided to make reservations later in our stay. Very nice restaurant on the pier. Restaurant looks like a ship as you enter the walkway to the deck. We had dinner on the main floor - there were tables on the 2nd floor of the restaurant. Service and food were good.  Not to worry, the boat didn't sway back and forth while we were there...and it was a nice evening. 

Bread was nice and warm... Appetizers: I highly recommend the bacon wrapped scallops! OMG, they were sooo good... I could've had it for my main dish! We also had salad and clam chowder as well.

Main dishes included: Filet mignon wrapped with applewood smoked bacon with veggies and rice, 1.5 pound lobster, and lazy lobster.

Dessert: Cheesecake and ice cream to share...so stuffed that could only sample. 

Definitely a place we will come back to again when in town.

Dimillo's has it's own parking lot - don't forget to get parking validated for free parking for dining only. There is a time limit."
924,"My wife loved her salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side & a large perfectly cooked piece of Salmon.

All I wanted was a cheeseburger. I had to send it back for a couple of reasons. Obvious that is was a frozen Hamburg & I asked for it medium rare. The ""Hockey Puck"" was well done. in addition the fries obviously were sitting out way to long.Sent back & opted for a cup of seafood chowder which was lacking and substance of fish. & the beat goes on. Our server was terrible Every table around us who came in after us was served meals well before us.
3rd time here & there will never be a fourth time.
Let the travelers pay a high price for mediocre food.
Personally this is a 1* star for me."
925,"DiMillo's Portland is a upscale  seafood restaurant directly on the water in a huge former car ferry nicely renovated. DiMillo's  features seafood, steaks, local Maine Seafood with nautical decor & harbor views.
Park in the adjacent public parking and parking is complimentary a nice touch.
Fruta del mar over black squid was  outstanding. 
The Lemon Ginger Salmon broiled and served over blueberry ginger risotto was very good. 
The three star rating is that the server
PAULINA absolutely horrible and rude! 
My brother-in-law is handicapped and seems annoyed at him. Paulina randomly placed silverware in the middle of the table like family style service.
Certainly not the type service when spending $250 for dinner.
Lovely restaurant but in this case service was subpar."
926,"Delicious eats and a prime location right on the bay. Definitely where you go for dinner in Portland if you want amazing lobster and views.

I came in for a rehearsal dinner for my friend's wedding and from start to finish this was a truly decadent meal. The night started off with cocktails, bowls of bacon wrapped scallops and an impressive cheese board spread. Anyone who will serve me bacon wrapped scallops by the bowl is immediately my favorite person. Aperol Spritz was on point, scallops were fresh and covered in thick and smoky bacon and the highlight of the cheese board was a cheese that had fresh blueberries in it... yum.

I knew that we we'd be in for a treat for dinner and I was not wrong. The feast started with clam chowder, goat cheese salad and fresh bread and butter. And then of course, there was the lobster. Meaty, delicious, buttery and perfect. The dish was also served with some fresh veggies. Finally to top complete the quintessential Maine dinner the night ended with a hot and gooey blueberry cobbler.

I'm surprised to see that DeMillo's comes in a 3.5. I had a 5 star experience here, and definitely plan to return next time I find myself in Portland."
927,"I felt this place is a little overrated. The ambience was really cool but I thought the food was mediocre. The wait times are crazy as well. We waited around an hour and were seated inside the ship. The pastas we ordered (seafood scampi, lobster Mac and cheese) were really bland. They did have really good appetizers. I recommend the tuna tataki and steamed clams. 

Another tip is make a reservation a few days ahead if you don't want to wait in line. Their reservations fill up really fast, especially during the weekend."
928,"Read the reviews and went here last night 'cause I really wanted lobster. Lovely venue in an old ferry renovated into a very classy looking eatery. 
I ordered the Lazy Lobster as the waiter said it would be a complete lobster without having to remove the shell.
My meal showed up in a shallow four inch dish with about 12 bite sized pieces of lobster and a very old baked potato. I would've complained but figured our surly waiter would probably spit in my new order. 
I recommend going here for drinks and the harbor view but skip the food"
929,"We came here for dinner and it definitely did not live up to its expectations. The food was subpar and the service was pretty terrible. Our waitress was quite rude and curt with us. We were seated and she took quite a while to come around. When she did get to us I had a couple questions about the menu but she responded in quite a haughty manner that did not make us feel welcome. The lobster was quite expensive, but not as good because it was over cooked. The food was b oysters instead of DiMillo's. 

For a high end restaurant, the service was lacking. She was friendly with other tables, but extremely rude when it came to us. It was very unfortunate because we saw other wait staff being extremely attentive and welcoming with the patrons. I will probably not be returning here when I visit again with family because you are really just paying for ambience and good service, both of which we didn't get."
930,"Went here for my 50th Birthday and it was awesome. We each had lobster and i got clam chowder, everything was delicious and the ambiance was perfect"
931,"I would give DiMillo's 3 1/2 starts if I could. It was overall pretty disappointing service wise. We came with a group of 5 for dinner and were seated promptly. After that everything went downhill. 
Though you might be ""paying for the view"" there wasn't much of it when sitting in the middle of the boat. With entrees starting at $22-40, I expected far better service. It's pretty much a tourist trap. 

Our waitress was slow to greet us and even slower to get drinks out.  After ordering our entrees, a bread basket and butter was brought out. Then our bread plates were whisked away, so we assumed food was about to come out. Nope. 
Food came out 25 minutes later (about 38 minutes after ordering). During this time we listened to three rounds of happy birthday from tables around us. Clearly this is a special occasion kind of place.  
The portions were huge. The fried chicken thigh & polenta with bacon marmalade was really intense and creamy. It was too rich to even finish half of. The haddock dishes were decent, but the green bean sides were so al dente they were not edible. 

The only way I would hit DiMillo's again would be on the weekday happy hour in the bar area, not the dining room. There are far better options downtown."
932,I love this place...! every timeI am in town for the week for work i go at least 3 or 4 times.   Great haddock chowder.  Happy hour menu is great.  I sit at the bar and bartenders are Great!  I recently had the lobster mac n cheese...it is life changing!
933,"We came on a weekday without a reservation, but happily were able to get seated right away. It was on the early side, and there was definitely a wait by the time we left.  It has a nice ambiance with dim lighting and soft jazz music.  
They have a good wide selection and price ranges. They have a really excellent ceasar salad with anchovies. For main courses we had a seafood etouffe and the pecan encrusted haddock.  Both were very well prepared.
Service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Definitely an excellent waterfront restaurant."
934,"We went here for lunch, which is a great time to come as it is not super crowded like for dinner. They have a special lunch menu which is far less expensive than dinner.  just do not go when a cruise ship docks in town as all the restaurants by the waterfront get slammed and it gets crazy busy.  

The atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable, the staff attentive and friendly, and service is above average.  Don't be afraid to ask your waitperson for their suggestions.  They're honest and can turn you on to
great food.  

I have been here twice and cannot wait to visit again!"
935,"We went here in between lunch and dinner and had an excellent meal. Our waiter, Alex, was very busy but still  attentive enough to chat with us and bring our drinks and food in a timely manner. He even took our picture with our phone and did a good job of that. We had crab cakes which I thought were better than the ones I had in Baltimore a long time ago. I had a lobster roll and my sister had a haddock sandwich. The lobster tasted very fresh. The lemon rice was outstanding and so was the warm bread. 
The atmosphere here was interesting and different. The bar and dinning room are inside a big ship in Portland's harbor. 
All in all, we were very pleased with our dining experience at DiMillos."
936,"I began planning this dinner 3 months prior and 5,000 miles away.  We were going to be on a trip to visit family and my Mom's birthday was right in the middle of our vacation.  Since the larger part of my immediate family (cousins, uncle and aunt) all live on the mainland and were going to be on the east coast for another event, I figured it would be wonderful to celebrate my mom's birthday with everyone.  I enlisted my cousin in Boston to help me plan and she found DiMilo's, since we would be in Portland Maine during my mom's birthday.  This ended up being a wonderful choice.  DiMilo's is a beautiful restaurant on The Newport, a former ferry boat floating in Portland harbor.  The setting was beautiful and the food and service was just as wonderful.  With 13 of us, the staff made sure we all had what we wanted quickly and timed perfectly.  
Some of the feast that we enjoyed:  Bacon Wrapped Scallops, Mussels, New England Clam Chowder, Haddock Chowder, Lobster Stew and Baked Stuffed Lobster with a Baked Potato side.  Everything was delicious and prepared wonderfully.  The staff made celebrating my mom's birthday away from home such a special event for us.  I would highly recommend making DiMilo's a must do place when in Maine."
937,Amazing food!! Amazing views!!! Server was awesome made sure we always had full drinks. It was a hot day and with out even asking they sat us in a shaded spot but still next to the water. I ordered the filet it was honestly a really really good steak. Cooked just the way I like!
938,"This was an absolutely perfect lunch experience. Beautiful location, right on the water with a lovely view of the boats. Our waiter was great and very friendly. We went with two drinks, a beer and a cocktail made with fig vodka. Very different taste, but I did enjoy it. For lunch, we went with the fried lobster and spicy polenta. So amazing. I'd never had fried lobster before and it was a decadent treat. The other dish was salmon with a lemon ginger glaze served over blueberry risotto. Another fabulous treat for the taste buds. The salmon was perfect. The risotto was good but really was just regular risotto with blueberries added in. Very unique. The prices were fantastic too. Lots of food and great quality plus that magnificent view. We need to return before the fall ends and they close the outdoor seating for the season!"
939,"Kitsch, lovely, a part of my youth, and wonderful
Seafood.  When you visit Portland, you must take a meal at DiMillo's. 

All of the seafood is, obviously, incredibly fresh. Broiled, fried or baked you cannot go wrong. 

It's on a barge, lovely view of Portland Harbor and the Spring Point Light. 

A must visit."
940,"We were staying close by and returned for lunch. Much better experience.
than previous dinner. Each (2) had a cup of chowda (seafood best I've had) Broiled Scallops, Fried Shrimp. Scallops were done perfectly (not buried in bread crumbs) and came with tangy grilled asparagus, for my side I choose potato salad, which was closet thing to homemade I've had. My wife's fried shrimp were very big, could not eat all and came with frys. Could be wrong but they looked and tasted like fresh cut. Two lunch entrees were about $19.00 each plus the soups and beverage. Free parking on the wharf close to restaurant."
941,Everything was absolutely delicious. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which was exquisite. The service was amazing and we had such an unforgettable dining experience. Can't wait to go back!
942,"We were looking for a good place to eat out on the water. It was a rainy day, but fortunately they had covered outdoor seating so we could still feel the breeze. One of the biggest downsides that I didn't expect was that I didn't have bug spray that day and we were sitting next to some flowers that seemed to be a haven for mosquitoes. My back was completely covered in mosquito bites - probably about 13 or 14 giant welts. Not the fault of the restaurant, of course, but my first warning is that if you eat here, bring your bug spray (or eat indoors, of course!) 

The food was very good. I have a gluten intolerance and they made a point to mention that they didn't have gluten free bread. It's not a huge deal to me because some places do, some places don't, but of course I do look more favorably on those that do! The waitress was very knowledgeable about what did and did not have gluten though, which was a relief. Between my partner and I, we had the mussels, clams, seafood broil, and lobster. I don't have lobster or fresh seafood as often as I'd like, but I found it to be very delicious. A bit on the expensive side, but it's seafood, so it's kind of a ""well, what do you expect?"" kind of deal. 

Honestly I think that the best part of the meal was the dessert. My partner and I split a key lime pie gelato that really had that good tart key lime flavor and wasn't overly sweet like a lot of places are. It was a good close to the meal. We also started with two cocktails - I forgot what my partner had, but I had the jumbo bloody Mary that I liked a lot. I especially loved the giant jumbo shrimp that came with it! 

Overall we had a good meal. We got there right as they opened so we had no trouble getting a table, but I could see this place becoming very crowded very easily, so make sure to get there early. I don't think we'll be back to Portland for a while, but if we do venture up that way again, we'll definitely stop back in!"
943,"Unbelievable service, food, drinks, view and more!! This place deserves 7 stars. Can't wait to go back again one day. Thank you so much for the great experience and I will certainly tell everyone if they're ever in Portland to come here."
944,"Very nice dinner experience. Their renovation was great and it was fun to be there for the Christmas decorations.
The fish is fresh and well prepared, and the service is attentive."
945,"Every cruise to Portland leads us to DiMillo's for lunch. Today it was clam chowder, Boston salad and fried fish sandwich. 

The clam chowder was exceptional and worth getting even if you only get that. It's was perfect. Shared a bowl with the mrs. 

She had the Boston salad with fresh bacon bits (chunks). She left none for me to finish. 

My fish sandwich came on a nice bun and was tasty. I chose fries but the fries were average. 

The restaurant is clean and the view outside is appealing."
946,"Last time I was here the everything was great except for after. The after part was bad, which was the food poisoning. Now every time I have been there I am extremely cautious about taking eating precautionary"
947,"I was super pleased with my first lobster roll experience at DiMillo's.  If I am being honest, we were going to go to the Portland Lobster Co. next door because that's where everyone tells you to go, but ended up here because parking was free and validated in the lot if you ate at DiMillo's haha...and I friggin love a deal.

We were pleased.  Sat in the back room with a view of the water and marina.  It was October, but the room was heated and super comfortable.  It was exactly what we needed after the long drive from Massachussets to Maine.  Got the lobster roll with fries.  It was good.  A little pricey, but after a weekend in Maine I realized all lobster rolls are pretty standard and pretty pricey.  

The service was great.  We were in and out in a very timely fashion and able to continue on our trip to the next destination - Acadia.  Overall, I recommend!"
948,Perfect place for having happy hour drinks and food on a huge boat ‍ which is attached to the dock. The lounge has very comfy chairs at the tables as well as a huge bar . Loads of windows so you can see the harbor. My Bloody Mary was okay and had a hint of a cocktail sauce taste. My haddock soup was yummy and steamy hot with loads of haddock and potatoes! The buffalo shrimp  was a bit hot but the shrimps were huge! The meatball was size of a baseball with risotto on top and swimming in a marinara sauce. Our other meatball was wrapped in risotto with risotto in the middle and sitting on top of delicious marinara sauce. This is definitely worth a meal to enjoy in Portland!
949,"My fiancee's parents are visiting from Europe and wanted to take us out for a nice lobster dinner. We cook better than most people we know, so when we eat out, it's with purpose. It's the holiday season, and Portland is lit up beautifully, so my fiancee decided we'd go to a restaurant in town that serves lobster. We called ahead and were told the place we wanted doesn't take reservations. Our visitors are in their late 70s and waiting in a crowded standing-room-only area is not an option, so we made sure to get there by 5:15, thinking we'd surely be able to get a table. But the place was packed already. So we went to DiMillo's. Huge mistake.
I've lived in Portland since 2010, worked in the restaurant industry for 12 years, was a professional cook, and I do private catering. I know food and I know the business, and I knew we were heading into a tourist trap in which the location would far surpass the food. But we were all having lobster--it's pretty hard to mess that up. And I didn't expect a level of gross incompetence that could have cost an older man his life. 
The place was warm, inviting, and nicely decorated for the holidays, I'll give them that. Our guests were pleased with the atmosphere and lack of noise. But our troubles started with our server. She had a distinct lack of affect, which was off-putting. I was interested in the drink entitled something like ""A Tale of Two Locals,"" which contains rum and some sort of tequila cream, topped with cayenne. I asked our server if the drink was sweet at all, and explained I don't like sweet drinks. She took the menu from me and spent a couple of moments reading exactly what I had just read, then she came back to the table, recited what'd we'd both read, then asserted it wouldn't be sweet. I was immediately suspicious of the knowledge base of a woman who'd assumed I can't read and had nothing further to offer than the menu description. Me: What is tequila cream? Her: It's kind of like Rum Chata. Me: Isn't Rum Chata kind of sweet? She just shrugged her shoulders and half nodded an acknowledgment. I realized I wasn't going to be able to get quality information from this person, so I ordered a martini. 
Our server seemed new at her job and not comfortable in the role. She had trouble carrying three martinis and a beer to the table, and she spilled a lot of gin before we finally had them in front of us. When we ordered lobster, she didn't tell us what our options were with them (as I overheard other servers doing), nor did she point to where the list was located on the menu and ask what we'd like. Instead, she said to the first person who ordered, ""Ok, lazy lobster. With a baked potato?"" as if there were no other options. 
We ordered steamed clams, and we asked about the size of the order. She made a shape motion with her hands and said the bucket was about that big. We asked if she could approximate how many clams we'd get or the weight b/c we were splitting among 4 ppl. She said no and made no move to find out. So we ordered one bucket and we each had a few clams. My fiancee was aggravated, but she was obviously trying, and I felt bad for her. 
Then came the dinner disaster. We'd ordered 1 lazy lobster, and 3 in the shell. Steamed. Period. We all got the baked potato. The easiest, most expensive order. The kind every server loves. But when our lobsters arrived, they were cold. Ok, the tails were warm-ish. The claws and legs were actually chilly to the touch. The only thing hot about the meal was the plates. My fiancee's claw meat was a little tough, but we gave the benefit of the doubt the rest of it would be ok. However, we wanted a hot dinner.  
The server took the plates and while my fiancee's mother ate her lazy lobster, we waited. Eventually, we received the same lobsters (with a piece of my fiancee's lobster on his father's plate), which were barely warmer. The meat was tougher than before, bordering on inedible. When the server checked back, my fiancee said they weren't much warmer, but they'd already been nuked to death with no saving them at this point. The server's tone was snarky when she responded, ""They weren't microwaved. They were re-steamed."" Then she walked away. She didn't offer to make anything right. We wanted his parents to have a nice night, so we weighed the negative effects of a disgusting meal against the effects of taking our complaints up the chain of command. Had we been alone, we'd have refused to eat it or pay. Given that my fiancee's mother was enjoying her dish, and our server was clearly reluctant to ensure we had a good experience, we choked down our lobster. In the middle of the night, my fiancee's father spent three hours vomiting his dinner, his mom was nauseous, and my stomach has been churning. Given what we ate, the time of year, and the course of the illness, this is a clear case of food mishandling by DiMillo's, which can KILL an older person. Terrible service, inexcusable food."
950,"The wait was over an hour (after being told 15-20 minutes).

Staff was courteous and professional. Atmosphere was casual. Restaurant was clean. View is spectacular of the harbor.

I got the Fisherman's Platter, which had the best scallops and second best clams I've had since we returned to Maine. The fish was light and flakey. Clams were the smaller variety and tender. Shrimp was small, tender and very fresh tasting."
951,"Tourist trap!!!!! Just those two words. High end prices for greasy lobster!!!! We had the fried lobster and the regular lobster in butter with bread crumbs ..!!!! It was just not good ! Our waiter forgot our crab cake order , would have loved to try those . However , what we did try it was pretty bad. Do not recommend"
952,"I was skeptical of this place due to the reviews, but all the locals kept saying we had to try it. We ultimately decided that even if it wasn't super fancy, we felt it was a Portland staple, so we had to make the stop. The atmosphere is very romantic, and there were people both dressed nicely as well as casual. It is on a boat, so the views were nice. Make sure to make a reservation early so you can get a table next to the window - we went on a Monday evening and it was impressive how packed it was. Take the time to explore the boat because there is a lot to see. The service was okay, our waitress was around an acceptable amount of time, but I wouldn't call it incredible service. Drinks were pretty and food was really good. Honestly, the prices weren't that expensive for what you were getting. Just remember this is an older, local restuarant, you get full plates of good food - this isn't a fancy plated dinner. It's definitely a good stop in the area for the Portland culture and atmosphere, but know there's a lot of really great food other places in the city."
953,"We came here for happy hour after a recommendation from a local. They have a nice happy hour. Alcohol happy hour depends on the day. When we came (Wednesday) it was 5 dollar select wines. They also have a ton of appetizer options that are 5 and 6 dollars and clam chowder and haddock chowder. I like the vibe- since you are on a ship and you get a view of the bay. We sat in the lounge by the window and it was nice! Service was good. We opted for the Sicilian meatball, risotto ball, buffalo shrimp and clam chowder. All were delicious!!"
954,"A-OK restaurant that gives you plenty of beautiful views (if you are sitting outside) and good food.

Reading other reviews, I could see how problems with long waits could be a problem. My visit here was in between lunch and dinner, so that wasn't a problem for me personally.

As expected, DiMillo's on the Water has a seafood-heavy menu. A non-fish eater myself, I did manage to the completely serviceable Black Angus Cheeseburger on the menu."
955,"Got the New England Clam Chowder. Wow was it good. I also had the 1 1/2lb lobster, this was also fantastic. Service was good and atmosphere was fantastic."
956,"The food is okay if you like seafood. I don't. Every major function seems to be hosted here because its on a boat. If this is a boat restaurant, does it have a captain? I don't think so. Its perma-tethered to the dock. The staff and setting are great; I just want county people to stop thinking of this place as the be-all end-all for fine dining in Portland. Sure its great flavor and its a boat but there is a vibrant and diverse set of world class restaurants in Portland that deserve some credit but don't get it because they are not on a boat. Try the Corner Room, Grill Room, Central Provisions, or Timber. All solid, consistent non-boat options. Even Nosh, Slab, or Duckfat. Its just a boat people."
957,"We went for a long leisurely lunch over the weekend.  It's been a while since our last visit and we were very pleased to see that DeMillos has been refreshed inside and out, including the food.  While they still have the reliable Maine seafood standards, there were a few new twists that made the menu interesting.  Most importantly the food was great!"
958,"If I could, it would be 6 stars or more! Yes, we waited about 45 minutes, but it was so worth it! Shrimp cocktail - huge, HUGE! I asked for extra lemons - see the photo! Luigi was fabulous! Clam chowder - suburb flavor, may be the best ever. Fried shrimp - large, barely any breading, perfect! Perfect! With extra lemon and cocktail sauce. Ok, this is where we were over the top impressed. Husband got the steamed clams. Luigi took the time to teach him how to peel off til you see the shiny part, rinse IN THE CLAM juice they were steamed in and then dip in buttah or cocktail sauce - husband was about to cry, he was so happy.
Final comment - the green beans, the green beans!!!!! Best taste I have ever had. Apparently, they get them locally. Well, my son and I could have eaten those all night if we were not already full from everything else. Eli's root beer float and blueberry cobbler. Our tummy's were already full, but we're in Maine - so we had to indulge."
959,"Ok I am probably in the minority for those that like to come here to bring ""out of towners"" to get some lobster on the water or anything but I am going to say I have not been impressed with the three times that I have been here.  There has been issues with the service all three times and then there is also something about the price of the food where I feel as if you pay for the scenery and not necessarily the quality of the food and service.

With that being said, there is something to say for the scenery during the summer as the boats are in the water, the music might be playing at the waterfront show and the sun is setting to create a great experience.

I am just one that feels that if I am paying the dollar that I am paying for, then the food and experience should be amazing ALONG with the other things that are happening on the surroundings.

I had to go with the middle of the road stars here because none of the experiences stood out to me out of the three times.  I am sure someone will be visiting and want to go there so, maybe next time will win me over!"
960,"I really wanted to like this restaurant more.   The location is the best thing about it and the service is pretty good, but the food is just OK, nothing special.  For the prices, I expected a little better!"
961,Amazing place to eat. Food was absolutely ahhhmazing! Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and answered any question we had. Everything was delicious!
962,"I wanted to go to a 4.5 Star restaurant about four blocks away, but the family wanted to go here.  I'm glad we did.  On the water and very kid friendly.  They have the normal Crayons and coloring book, but it also comes with Teddy Grahams.   

I had the calamari bruschetta, which was amazing!  And we also shared the scallops.

Highly recommend."
963,We had Lisa C as our waitress and she was fantastic. I can't say enough good things about her. The food was also wonderful. I had the lobster Mac and cheese and although I couldn't finish it all it was great.
964,We went for a birthday dinner AT 8 PM and the food was lack luster. Often times a drink refill took 10-15 mins. Our calamari came old cold and they remade it but it was a disappointing start to the evening considering it took almost an hour for them to get to our table. The seafood Alfredo tasted like it had been made in the microwave with a thick gelatinous texture It was underwhelming accompanied by a piece of garlic bread that must have been floating in butter before it was put on the plate. The filet my husband ordered was chewey and not a great cut of meat I would have expected better at DiMillo's. Our waiter Chris was doing his best and he was probably one of the positives of the evening. We brought a cake and they sang and were extremely gracious to our party so I must say I appreciate that.
965,"How can you F..... up lobster?well DiMillos can do it!! Our lobsters had been dead prior to cooking( based on the mushy tail meat)  and then the stuffing was pure bread crumbs thrown in the middle!  
It was a $200 dollar meal that was THE worst I have EVER had!!! 
I am a exiled Mainer and was soo looking forward to a nice lobster! 
We should have sent them back but were with friends so didn't want to spoil the time!  
DO NOT go here!! A lobster shack would have served better food!"
966,"Interesting place with lots of nautical stuff... but very touristy...

HANDS DOWN WORST Caesar salad I've ever had, and it was 10 bucks.  Scallops with bacon were good, but slightly undercooked scallops... 

NE Clam Chowder was VERY good.

Service was VERY good."
967,"We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and it was very busy, we had a party of 5 and had tried to make reservations, but at the point I called they had stopped taking anymore. We decided to go anyway and were told it would be a 90 min wait, which we accepted...we ended up waiting 45 min instead which was good. 
    Our food was great and the only reason I give this 4 stars is the service.  We were seated at about 7:30 and within 15 min had appetizers delivered...the problem we had was our meals weren't delivered until almost 9:30....and we had no communication from our server that there was a delay and most other patrons near us had already left . I had to get up and ask for someone to check on our food.  
    We were dining with our 7 year old granddaughter and she barely ate anything by the time we got it. 
   We would return, but didn't think that this was a good experience overall."
968,"Very interesting location and venue. Food was unique and amazing. Ate at the bar and enjoyed ourselves a great deal. Don't go by the fact you cannot see this place from the street , head on down the ramp to this ship of fun."
969,A true Portland classic.  Scenery and setting inside & outside the restaurant is mesmerizing. Outstanding menu offerings and believe it or not favorite item is the homemade ricotta meatball. It is divine!! Seafood is always fresh. Staff is always accommodating and welcoming. Great place to have a private function.
970,Such a great location and a treat to go there... That said... They are way over priced for the quality of their food. A $33 filet arrived over cooked and took 20 minutes to replace. When it came back none of the garnishments/sauces were included and the rest of my party was already basically done. Such a letdown. I'm glad they redid it without a hassle but the dissapointment was huge. We go there while on vacation probably once every 3-4 years and are in no hurry to return. Portland has become a first class dining City and Dimillos needs to step up their game to stay relevant.
971,Lobster roll was fantastic!  It was stuffed full of lobster and the bread was delicious but the lobster was definitely the star of the show. Great atmosphere and service too.
972,"I went here with a party of 10 for myself and my two brothers birthday. I had great expectations for this place, the location is right on the water and actually rocks you back and forth like a baby going to sleep. Unfortunately this is probably the best part of the entire restaurant. 

It was a Saturday night and our waitress was very nice, but the service was slow. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the entire dinner (I shit you not) took three hours. Yes it's seafood, yes it was a Saturday night, yes we had a party of ten. But that is just unacceptable, when the waitress brought our food, everyone had a piece of garlic bread on the side of their plate (nobody's good included it so I assume that was to make up for the wait). This was nice, and arguably one of the best garlic breads I've had. However here is the problem: For 27 dollars for a 12 ounce cut of prime rib, you would expect some sort of vegetable, bread, some seasoned garnish or something. I've never been more disappointed receiving a 27 dollar meal. The cut of meat was cooked well, medium, but it was 20 percent fat, and unseasoned and bland. The au jus sauce tasted nothing better than hot water mixed with  a beef ramen flavoring packet, which you had to dunk into because the entire cut of meat was cold. Not lukewarm, cold to the touch of my tongue. Yes, the outside of the meat that was touching the pan while cooking. Now... maybe the sides would redeem this meal. I was optimistic. I ordered a loaded baked potato, and was excited to have a hot stuffed tater with cheese melting all over and bacon. Again, I shit you not, for 27 dollars they give you a potato (it was baked I'll give DiMillo's that) with chives mixed with sour cream, what looked like shredded mozzarella cheese that comes in the bag from market basket, and shredded bacon IN SEPARATE CUPS. Let me repeat that again, IN SEPARATE CUPS. Come on man, I'm sorry but I feel as if my wallet was raped that night. And my stomach. I cannot speak for any of the seafood, my brothers fiancé got the Salmon and she really enjoyed it. 

In conclusion, if you love seafood and want to be comfortably rocked back and forth while you wait for two hours and then eat extremely overpriced sub par bland food, go to DiMillo's and eat yo heart out. Otherwise hit the damn super market, drizzle some lemon juice with garlic and salt & pepper over a 2 pound filet of your favorite fish, be happy your wallet hasn't been rigorously violated"
973,"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was just as great.  Some minor things would make this a 5* in my book, but it shouldn't hold people back from going and experiencing this restaurant.  Our table ordered about 2-3 of each app.  The meatball had fresh mozzarella on it and was good.  The clams were good, but I found the mussels to be one of the stars of the night.  The broth goes great with the bread.  The crab cakes were good and I found the shrimp cocktails just a tad over cooked, but not too much.  I had the full stuffed 2.5lb lobster.  The stuffing wasn't something that I'd write home about because I was expecting some more texture to it...BUT the lobster was plentiful and prepared well.  I'll tell you the one star of the night was one I least expected - the lobster Mac and Cheese.  Very very tasty!  I looked at another tables order who had the scallops and they looked really good (we also had the bacon wrapped scallops and those were delicious). I was also happy that the server worked with someone I was with to create a custom vegetarian dish. Again, keep in mind that this is a good rating, but with areas to improve on to make it even better.  The IPA's on tap complimented the food nicely.  I would go back for sure, but next time I'd go with the steamed lobster, the lobster mac and cheese or the scallops."
974,"Just came here to eat the other day and thought I would come again today. We had Katherine as the server today and she was unpleasant and very short. I asked her what was good and she decided to repeat the side items a couple times. Then I asked again and she said everything was good. Since ordering our drinks, she was already impatient and unpleasant. I asked for another server and a few times when Katherine passed by, she gave me a nasty look, cut her eyes at me, and even later stood on the raised seating area and stared. This is uncalled for and immature of someone at her age. She shouldn't be in the food and bev business if she can't provide good service. Lisa, on the other hand, had been the complete opposite with her service and demeanor. If not for Lisa, we would've gotten up and left."
975,"This restaurant has a lovely view on the water. That is where the positive qualities end. The service was painfully slow, our order was done incorrectly, and then the food was bland; almost institutional quality. Sorely disappointed."
976,"My family (husband and two young teen boys) were visiting from Michigan, and we were looking forward to a lobster dinner on our last night in Portland. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on DiMillo's. 

There was no wait (Monday night) which was nice. The staff seemed bored and not very welcoming, but I wasn't upset by it at all. Our server was very slow to come to our table, and wasn't very attentive the entire meal. She did, however, take the time to explain how to break apart lobster (it was our first time eating it), which was nice. I wasn't too thrilled that she carded my husband for his drink but didn't card me! Haha, I'm 36 and my husband is 37. 

I ordered the seafood scampi and the rest of the family ordered lobster. The scampi was disappointing--I definitely would not recommend it. It didn't have much flavor at all, and needed salt. The scallops in the scampi were good, but the shrimp and lobster were over cooked. 

My family enjoyed trying lobster for the first time, but all agreed it was overrated. Certainly not worth $230! 

One thing that I really appreciated was that the owner came to our table and chatted with us for a couple of minutes. He was very kind. 

Overall, I gave DiMillo's two stars because of the subpar service, aloof staff, and just so-so food. I was hoping to rave about it, but we wouldn't go there again."
977,"Summer in Maine is about the beautiful weather and ocean....and would never be complete without a trip to DiMillo's on the water.  This family owned gem defines what Maine is all about..amazing seafood and waterfront sounds and smells on an amazing boat.  The restaurant is managed by generations of the DiMillo's crew and staff.  The food is fresh off the boat, and Chef Melissa and her team offer consistency and quality that you will love.  Order a shrimp cocktail and you won't be disappointed!!!  They also boast the very best lobster Bisque in Maine.....On top of that...the family is all about community.  Many times the family hosts charitable events on  the top of the boat. 
The  owners are always walking around connecting with guests, this place is special.  If you haven't been to DiMillo's.... I highly suggest you go and experience the best family restaurant in Maine."
978,"Oh, what a disappointing restaurant. But. There are bright spots. Let's list them.
1. Cheerful, free (with dinner) valet parking. Big ups.
2. Excellent, cheerful (again) well coordinated team bar service. Fast, correct, knowledgeable, funny, warm, gracious, attentive. All good. And good drinks.
3. Great reception  with passed appetizers. Nice beef skewers, shrimp, bacon scallops. Very good. Again, cheerful, gracious, plentiful staff.
4. View = fab.
5. Good, well cooked (if frightfully expensive... 5.50 per) shrimp cocktail. $22 for four. Mercy. Sauce could have used less ketchup and more horseradish.
6. Generous and grateful treatment when handling a complaint. There was no need to adjust the bill to compensate for a less than expected entree but, well, good on you. And thanks.


Okay, so not dreadful, but squid ink pasta not so much. Stick to lobster and prime rib and the experience will satisfy. Cheerfully."
979,"A nice place to eat right on the water! Fun to go and experience when you are in Portland. 

Had the jumbo shrimp and they weren't kidding when they say they are jumbo! Served with a great tangy cocktail sauce! 

The coco-rita cocktail was a fun drink! 

Husband loved the lobster Mac and I wasn't in the mood for seafood and had the giant meatball with a side of their rigatoni and house sauce! All were very good! Fun place to sit out on the water and enjoy a nice meal."
980,"I had mixed feelings having dinner here. The reviews were too extreme; either people had a  great time or did not.

It was great being on the water. There were times when you felt the ship sway but other than that you wouldn't know you were on the water. We came here as a party of 9 for a birthday celebration.  The staff were nice and welcoming. Our waitress in the beginning seemed like she was frustrated with us but by the end of the night she was very friendly.

Service: We got here at around 8:15pm, we did not get our food till 9:40pm. By the time our food came we were all full from drinks and bread that we wrapped it to go.

Drinks: I had the coco-rita, which was supposed to be a cross between pina colada and margarita but tasted more like a margarita, couldn't taste the coconut. The most popular drink at the table was the Bahama mama.

Food: Where do I beginning? I was expecting a lot from this place. I had the special which was fish stuffed with crab meat, polenta and asparagus. Polenta was done to perfection, asparagus was not over cooked and my seafood was ok; a little underseasoned a common theme among the rest of the party. The lobster Mac and cheese seemed to be a hit at the table. Other than that nothing spectacular about it. 

Overall: Good a experience but I'm sure it is better when it is much nicer outside."
981,"Stopped in for lunch while on business in the area recently (3/30/18 to be exact). Overall dining experience was enjoyable. Was dining alone and kind of stuck in a corner to make way for larger parties. Service was OK, only saw my server for order and check, nothing in between. Had chowder, lobster roll and fries. Left there hungry, nothing impressive for the price paid ($36). The ambiance was not as impressive as I expected. Overall acceptable, wish I could have gotten some kind of attention from the wait staff, or at least a drink refill. 
I would give the place a second chance if I were with friends or family, but not on my own."
982,"The interior of this place is beautiful and unique! Some of the food was good, some - a little tasteless! The service was pretty fast, but not super welcoming! Generally, I would recommend this place!"
983,"10-11-17 6PM......dinner for 2.
New England Clan Chowder - absolutely superior
2 1/2 lb. Maine lobster boiled - excellent,
Baked potato - good not exciting 
Fish (haddock) , fries, broccoli - Haddock excellent, French fries very good, & broccoli excellent. 
Decor - excellent & excellent view of bay plus cruise liners.  First class choice
Parking - excellent
Waitress - excellent
Excellent restaurant .....I love this place."
984,"This place was recommended buy a person at my hotel -it's a great location with free parking ,but I was unimpressed with the small baked potatoes and my portion of pre-peeled lobster was not what I consider a value at $29"
985,"Food was not good- under seasoned, overpriced, and overcooked. We ordered scallops, the seafood alfredo, ravioli, and a small salad and each was disappointing. 
Ambience is nice and probably the only reason why it is interesting to visit. Also, our waiter was helpful and kind."
986,"Portland's best kept secret: You can get married at Dimillo's or simply have your nautical reception there!

My fiance and I are going to have an intimate wedding and reception next year, meaning it will not be the usual 75+ guests. I looked into numerous venues in Portland and discovered that our guest count was too small for places to even offer us a reasonable option when you factor in food minimums and having to rent way more space than we needed which also tacks on thousands of dollars. At the same time we had too many guests to make a large reservation. Portland is a prime destination wedding location which make it competitive and also, venues get booked more than a year in advance. I was really put off by some of the 'tudes I encountered from the more popular places that treated us like little people because of a small guest list.

Then I had an idea. We had attended a private function at Dimillo's earlier in the year and it was very well done! The food was delicious and the views obviously were great. Could we possibly celebrate there, I wondered? I contacted and met with Steve Dimillo (""Jr""). 

For only $400 (at the time of this review) rental fee you get to rent upstairs and have a deck to yourself! You can get married right on the deck overlooking the harbor! The menu was actually priced lower than other places we had checked yet sounded more enticing. There is free valet parking for all of your guests. Most importantly, Steve is very professional and responsive--something I can't say for some of the other venues we checked out. Dimillo's was the ONLY place that offered everything we were looking for, and the setting is gorgeous. Just stop with the ""but it's a tourist trap."" That's what I said to myself. When I ran it by my family they were like, ""Hello? We're tourists. It sounds perfect!"" But really it's an unfair assessment I had been carrying around. (Perhaps we need to talk about the overrated hipster traps, no?)

We had signed on but a few weeks later we had a wonderful and unexpected opportunity to get married out of town which we decided to do. Even though we had left a non-refundable deposit with Steve he is returning it to us cheerfully. We will definitely consider them for a future private event and I'm so glad my mind was opened to this great venue for private functions."
987,"Stopped on first night Portland with the family. 45 min wait on Friday at 7:30 was not unreasonable. Able to order drinks from bar. Has paging system to notify when table is ready. Enjoyed seating on second floor of deck with great view of harbor. Friendly staff. Super fresh food. We had whole lobsters, seafood pasta and crab cakes. Best fried oysters we've ever had! Generous sizes and fairly reasonable prices on whole lobsters for the area. Definitely recommend for a nice meal."
988,"We stumbled upon this restaurant while walking around downtown Portland. It looked like an interesting restaurant and we liked that they have a view of the water.  We were on the early side of the dinner hour, but they were booked for the dining room so we sat in the bar area. The bar area had plenty of tables where the full menu was served so it wasn't a big deal.

The service and ambiance were good. Our waitress wasn't overly friendly, but took good care of us. The restaurant had an old school feel.

My husband started with Steamed Clams that he enjoyed. The portion was larger than he expected too. I had the Haddock with cornbread stuffing and maple sauce on top. It was really good. I loved the flavor in the cornbread stuffing and the sauce was great with the fish. My husband had a Scallop sandwich and he enjoyed it. The portions on everything were good for the price."
989,"Awesome seafood on the water and a great way to start my weekend in a new city. Seafood was cooked very well but my issue is with the hostess and their lack of accountability. I was notified that they were no longer taking reservations, so alas, being compliant I hung out on the patio for an hour til my table was ready since the bar was full. After over an hour of waiting, we went to the front desk and asked if our table was ready. They asked, ""are you sure you never left the restaurant?"" We didn't and we informed her of that. She proceeds to tell us that our pager was not registered and basically we waited for over an hour for nothing. Fortunately, they reconciled with us and gave us next available, unless we specified another seat. We chose with the next available. At the table, the waitress gave us an appetizer on the house, but that's really not much of an excuse for our lost time and lack of accountability on our table. Perhaps next time when we visit the issue will be resolved."
990,"I would love to be able to review the food but I didn't make it to that point of service. Came into the restaurant and encountered a host being very blunt and kind of rude to an old couple asking for a table. 

After getting our pager we decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready. While the bartender was very prompt in dropping off drink menus, she disappeared. No one took our drink order for probably five minutes. And when she did take our order she was completely unengaged and doing other stuff on the computer. 

At that point we really felt turned off to the restaurant and decided to return our pager and go somewhere else. 

It's a shame because our uber driver recommended the restaurant. The service was just too poor that we couldn't stay."
991,"Tourist trap. Bad seafood. Ordered scallops, lemon rice, and veggies. Veggies were way over cooked with no seasoning. Rice was clearly from a box. And the scallops left a lot to be desired. Not to mention one that was discolored and inedible. Server was nice but the inedible scallop situation went unresolved. Save your time/money and try one of the many other worthwhile places.i"
992,"Service was attentive. There was a hold up due to a printer not working, so to make amends we were told we could have a dessert on the house if we wished. Thanks!

The 1.5 steamed lobster was delicious. We ordered it with broccoli to help us get some veggies in.

The lobster roll is packed with lobster! The roll was standard - buttered and toasted.

Virgin bloody Mary was solid.

It was a nice experience. You pay a premium for the experience of eating on a boat on the water."
993,"I narrowed down my list of ""must-try"" restaurants before heading to Maine and happy to say DiMillo's made the cut. It's located on a boat, very nice ambiance. Restaurant is really comfortable and if you sit near a window on a sunny day it's the perfect balance between cool air conditioning and sunny warmth.

Food was delicious. Mom had fish and chips. Me and nephew had the lobster pasta. Wish we had split it because we both had leftovers. Would've saved a good amount of money. 

Parking is complimentary (up to 3 horus) while dining. Then the parking lot is $6/hour. You won't find anything cheaper in Portland's Old Port so just enjoy the scenery and the delicious meal."
994,"Went here for lunch today and had a great time. I thought for sure this was going to be a cheesy tourist trap but it was actually a nice restaurant. First I got the clam chowder (which I love) and thought it was above average. My friend and I each got an Alagash White which is a local brew and it came in a nice tall glass. I got the lobster roll which was fresh, well stuffed and had a light buttery taste on the roll. As a side I got the potato salad which had nice big chunks of potato and great flavor. My friend got the fish tacos which she said were really good! Nice, upscale vibe with the occasional rock of the sea. The waiter was very attentive and did a great job!"
995,"Wow! The wait is definitely worth it! Walk around and enjoy the view while you wait. 

Service was perfect

Food: Yummy!

Order the clams with the sauce (appetizer) this was my favorite . the sauce was so good we ordered  extra bread to just dip in the sauce... So oo oo wanted to just pick up the bowl and drink the sauce... But I reframed. Self control right there! 

Husband had the fried seafood platter. Great portion, good variety ( scallops, shrimp, clams, and haddock ) - he was raving about it days later!"
996,Came to Portland from New York for a day trip to grab some lobster and enjoy the scenery. Found this spot without realizing it's right where I  was a few years ago (J's Oyster). The restaurant is nice inside  and the views are awesome. I like to be by the waterside so this is perfect for me. This is on a boat so it does rock and may get you off guard if you're enjoying a few drinks; also this may not work well for some people with motion sickness. We had the beer on tap and a rum punch. Rum punch was good and the beers are fresh. The food was beyond awesome. Everything was fresh. The lobster here is the hard ones so be aware if you're not used to this. It will take some extra fighting to get the flesh out. The texture is also different. The experience was great and I will definitely recommend it and return when the opportunity arises.
997,"Once upon a time DiMillo's was the place to go for seafood, yet times have changed and there are many options in Portland, which are superior.  Still, DiMillo's remains a novelty and worth trying once for you to see for yourself if the venue has stood the test of time.  Servers at DiMillo's are well trained, friendly and personable.  Food orders are generous and on average usually pretty good.  DiMillo's specializes in seafood, which is what you should definitely order.  Their fish and shellfish are always fresh and flavorful."
998,"Pricey, but good. The restaurant is on a boat but it rarely sways. It honestly feels like you're on dry land. The lobster is outstanding and, though somewhat expensive, is a crucial part in any trip to Maine. Even if you don't like lobster (like my youngest daughter) there are plenty of options on the menu, so many that it's almost difficult to choose. Personally, the only bad part of our experience was accidentally moving the tables in the outdoor seating section."
999,"Nice restaurant on the water with cool decorations, get seated outside for a water view. Your parking gets validated! The wait is the worst, you wait 45 minutes to get a table and then maybe another 30 minutes to get your food. It's a nice place to visit but definitely if you were staying a few days, if it's a day trip to maine then I would skip this place. This place may seem a little pricey but the portions and freshness of your seafood is totally worth it. If you're a seafood lover than you'll notice the sweetness/freshness of the seafood."
1000,"First of all, the view by the windows is amazing, especially during sunset. 
For a family of 5 (3 adults, 1 teen, 1 kid) we ordered: cup of clam chowder, spicy calamari, bacon rolled scallions (for our appetizers); fried seafood platter, seafood scampi, lobster roll, lobster mac & cheese, and kids mac & cheese (for entrée)
Their clam chowder is quite good. Perfect creaminess and great soup to clam ratio. Their calamari & scallions were fantastic - amazing appetizers. However, the seafood platter had a little too much batter wrapped around the seafood. The scampi was too oily for my taste, but the lobster roll and the lobster mac & cheese were quite good. 
The service is also very attentive, and their Maine blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream dessert is delicious - highly recommend. 
Overall great restaurant, with wonderful views and a wide range of options for the menu."
1001,"So this place was a dinner choice as we could not make a decision. This is place is on the water and we were thinking about returning just for the view. Anyway,on to the food... I had the lobster stew- lots of lobster chunks for the miniature cup, however it was enough to to hit the spot pretty good, frutta di mar-spicy sauce but overall really good. My friend had the french onion soup which she said was very good; pecan crusted haddock which was really good, she liked the green beans. Couldn't stop talking about them. 
Overall a really nice place"
1002,"I have eaten here a few times while in Portland, and usually it is very good.  Tonite was a disappointment mostly due to the serivce.  It was a slow night, so not busy.  My waiter (Joshua) was initially very attentive. After I ordered it was all downhill.  The calamari was quick to be delivered and was way too sweet.  Then it was an inordinate amount of time for my filet to be delivered.  So much so that I commented to him, I thought you had forgotten about me- his reply was - well we have to cook the steak.  Really?  As if I didn't know.  Anyway, the filet was ok, surrounded by polenta and wrapped in bacon.  With so many restaurants to choose from in Portland, I will still give this place another chance only because of prior experiences which have been wonderful."
1003,"I took my wife, who is from Italy and is hands down, the best Italian cook that many people have ever seen. She actually was one of the top 10 finalists in tryouts for Master Chef.  She had the Fruiti Di Mare'and she said that it was made to perfection. I had the Haddock, Shrimp, Scallops dinner and it too was superb.
The service that we got from our waitress was great as well. This is an amazing restaurant. It used to actually be a huge boat and was converted to an exquisite dining experience by Tony DiMillo many years ago at a great expense and even greater challenge.  A dining experience there is a must see while in Portland, ME."
1004,"Love the atmosphere and the history of being on the old boat! The view is amazing and the experience is equally as great.

The food comes in HUGE portions! Made it in time for the lunch special and, unlike other restaurants that skimp on the portions for the lunch menu, DiMillo's fills the plate to the top! I thoroughly enjoyed my fried seafood platter and I was absolutely stuffed. The quantity and quality for the price is top notch.

Next time I'm in Portland, I 100% will return!"
1005,"Leave this one for the tourists.
Cattle- stockade experience, get em in get em out bustle- you won't find locals there-  unless Uncle Ernie insists and is paying. 
Then order a dozen shrimp in a cocktail and fill up.

'Nuff said."
1006,"I would give it a 0 but that's not an option. The only reason I am rating this establishment without eating there is because of the poor customer service on the phone trying to make a reservation. I was trying to make a reservation for a large party 15-17 family members. This was not going to be possible unless we took a late reservation which would not be possible because my Nana Parmenter is 94 years old and can't stay up that late. I asked if there were any other options that would aid in my family being able to get in earlier, like maybe splitting the party. Nope ..... the super awesome lady who was assisting me (not assisting) said we only had the option of 8:30 pm and didn't offer any other assistance. Thanks for nothing! Guess we will go back to Phoenix without having a family diner together at DiMillo's like my Nana wanted."
1007,"Our waiter was not very attentive .
Did not check on us once to ask how the food was.  I ordered haddock which was great .  However my husband ordered filet mignon which was awful .  He ordered it medium and it was more towards the rare side and very fatty .  He ate a little of it even though I told him we should send it back .  When I was done the waiter finally came over to ask how it was.  I told him how bad the filet was.  He said oh sorry .
Nothing taken off the bill ....I would think part of the $33 filet should have been taken off .   We will never eat there again."
1008,"We loved this place from the moment we walked in. It was recommended to us by our shuttle driver Brandon from The Westin Hotel. Staff very friendly at the host stand, loved the historical artifacts. Kimberly our waitress was super friendly and inviting. She made great recommendations and we loved the food! Crab cakes were HUGE and delicious. Lobster mac was great and the lobster wasn't over done. The ravioli with crab meat added was heaven. We left very happy!!! Also, the speed of serv6was great and even thou it was rainy/foggy we still had a great view."
1009,"It's been a year since I've been to dimillo's getting ready to go on our annual trip to Maine  ....
Going back to dimillo's is non negotiable I can't wait to indulge in their mouth watering Seafood ...literally the best Seafood i have ever had in my life"
1010,"There's a certain... flavor... texture... when deep-fried FOOD is COLD.  

Our party of 3 was the second group seated, yet we WAITED 45 MINS. for our lunch, watching our waiter serve the subsequent party of 6.  When our food finally arrived, it was obvious my Fried Seafood Sampler & French Fries left the frialater over 20 mins. ago - the food was close to cold, the grease already solidifying, the fries inedible.  Our waiter quickly apologized however didn't offer to fix it, and my second beverage came with the check.

Epic Waiter Fail."
1011,"I'm not the type of person to do reviews, but I genuinely enjoyed this restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was great. We were passing through for a road trip and I am glad we stopped!"
1012,Do better getting seafood off the street. Fried platter was the worst. Seafood pasta was drenched in olive oil. Tastes like kids are cooking the food in the kitchen.  Total waste of money. Restuarant is a 2 on It's best day.
1013,Nice place with great decor and amazing views.  Entire restaurant is actually on a boat .  Food was great and service was great again.
1014,"Surprisingly good.   Was expecting just a tourist trap but we had an excellent experience.  The calamari and fried oysters were great choices for appetizers.   For entrees we had a filet, the Tuna carpaccio, the lazy man lobster and I had a 1.5 lobster dinner.  All were fantastic. Not a regret in the crowd.   And on top of the great food the service was spectacular.  Will definitely come back when we visit again."
1015,"Excellent place to visit when visiting Portland. The atmosphere was amazing, the service was excellent and the food was GREAT. Will visit again when we return to Portland."
1016,Good lunch. Lobster roll and fish tacos really great. Came early for Sunday lunch got a great seat inside.
1017,This was probably one of the best meals I've had. The bacon wrapped scallops and clam chowder were both amazing. Nice setting on a boat in the marina. Kind of pricy but to expected in such a tourist area.
1018,"One word... WOW!

My boyfriend and I decided to come here after we had gotten some oysters at Eventide (this place has been on our list for a bit!) 

We were expecting this place to be good, but not amazing. And boy were were happily wrong! 

We ordered a special called ""fisherman's platter"", which had fried whole clams, scallops, lobster tail, haddock, onion rings and fries! If I am remembering correctly, it cost $34 (can you say good deal?? I can!!) We also got 2 beers, which were allagash white (: 

Food review; AMAZING!! 

The breading was so light, fresh and crunchy! The scallops were SO impressively tender and fresh as well. Frying something like a scallop doesn't seem like an easy task, and they did it SO well!! They were soft, hot on the inside and crunchy on the outside (these were the star!!), secondly, the whole clams were really tender and yummy as well!! The haddock was also pretty tender! The lobster tail was a little more tough, but that was expected because those seem even harder to get crispy without overdoing them! But after the scallops, I was pretty stuck on them!! 

All in all, I would highly recommend eating anything of the thing I just mentioned, either together or separately!

I will for sure be back to try other things on the board!

Customer service review; AMAZING!!

We came in 15min to close (our bad), I hate being that person, but I am from out of town, and leave tomorrow, and needed to try this place before I left!! 

We were greeted at the counter with smiles, and good energy! I was happily surprised that they didn't look like they had pure hate for us because we came in very close to closing time. (Sorry!!! Thanks for being awesome!!) 

The two guys that were handling customers were super friendly, and nice!

We ordered 2 beers, but they had to switch the keg, and forgot that we had gotten a couple beers. So I reminded them about 10min after ordering them, and the guy I mentioned it to was SO apologetic, and seemed to feel so bad (he shouldn't have felt bad! They were busy, and close to closing down!), but I really appreciated his acknowledging that they never gave hem to us. 

I also usually never fill out customer comment cards, because service isn't usually so amazing that I feel the need to give feedback, but I did this time! (It basically said that I enjoyed that the people were nice, and that everything was fresh!)

Kudos to this place being amazing!!

I recommend EVERYONE try this place! (YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!) and if you are, sorry... That sounds like a you problem.. (just kidding.. haha)"
1019,"This place is awesome!  The seafood is extremely fresh and a good deal- get the fisherman's platter for a mix of a little bit of everything.  Everything is fried on point and not overcooked - the fried lobster tail was perfectly tender, unlike at other seafood shacks.  The batter is also not too thin.  Basically if you want fried seafood done right, come here.  

Tried the fried oyster taco as well.  A good mix of vegetables gave crunch and the chipotle sauce provided a kick of flavor.  Definitely worth trying out, but the fried platters are still my #1."
1020,"One of the biggest struggles in my relationship with my partner is that he loves seafood and seafood would love to murder me by way of anaphylaxis. It's always a challenge to find some place where he can get his fill and I can continue to live!

Tonight we ordered in from Bob's and I gotta say, really good food. I was able to get the two cheeseburger dinner and he could get a clam platter. Everything was packaged a few times so there was no risk if contamination. And my burgers were quite thick for a place that focuses on clams. Portions were generous and my partner said the clams were fried the perfect amount."
1021,"My nephew 'just had to' have a lobster roll before he went back to England.  Having driven past Bob's the other day, quite by accident, we gave it a try for lunch.

Being the off-season it was pretty quiet, which is great - no lines and all that.  There are a few parking spaces on the side of the building too, which is a plus in Portland.

He had his lobster roll and, of course, I immediately regretted not getting one.  The bun is quite small but the chunks of lobster are a good size and there is plenty of it.  I had a taste of one of the chunks and it was really good (again with the regrets...).  I had the patty melt, which was too salty for me.  Luckily, the fries were not salted so it kind of balanced the meal out.

I will most definitely be back to get my own lobster roll and also to try the clam chowder.  I was eyeing someone else's (whoever you were; I apologize for ogling your food)."
1022,"Boy oh boy, where do I begin! First off, the service was phenomenal. We were originally going to order  the Seafood Basket, which comes with clams, scallops and fish ($35.95) and a small boxed side of the lobster tail ($20.95). The staff noticed we were in town and offered us the Seafood Basket with Northern Shrimp ($39.95) with the Fried Lobster Tail as a substitute for the shrimp. $4 dollars more for lobster tails? Hell yeah! 

The food is served pretty quickly and boy, was there a whole lot of golden brown goodness! The scallops were crispy on the outside, but super juicy and tender in the inside. The clams were fried to perfection and the fish was just a delight because it was so fresh. The lobster tails were huge and very flavorful! Speaking of flavor, their cocktail sauce was next level awesomeness. It was so good that I asked if they had bottles that could be purchased. The staff said they usually sell it in plastic containers, but he gave me a bunch of them in a brown paper bag to go. 

This establishment deserves the highest yelp praise for their hospitality, service, and food. Heck, that cocktail sauce alone deserves a 5 star rating. You should definitely check this place out, you won't regret it!

PS - They also sell beers and frozen ice cream drinks. I don't remember the exact name, but I got the espresso one and it was amazing!!"
1023,"I'm not a big fan of fried food. Hold your gasps, people. I just like tasting my ingredients in their pure form and not losing that flavor in a batter-coated, greasy form. It doesn't really appeal to me (minus fried chicken and especially Korean fried chicken, that stuff is next level).

However, my friend loved this place so much that we went twice during our time in Portland. He got a platter with fried scallops and fried whole clams, then returned another day just to get the clams again. The fried scallops were really plump and surprisingly tender, and there was just enough batter to coat it, but it wasn't thick at all. This went really well with tartar sauce. But perhaps the best combination was the fried seafood with their hot sauce. I tried some of the whole clams with the hot sauce and damn near got my own order because they were so good. Really satisfying, comforting food.

This used to be 3Buoys, which served absurdly large lobster rolls (my two friends and I came once and split a massive $24 lobster roll, which amounted to a regular-sized roll for each of us... good times), so I was really sad that they closed. But this isn't a bad spot to take its place."
1024,"came to Bob's  for incredible fried clams. They had a Sunday special on a seafood platter that had scallops,haddock, clams , a lobster tail and onion rings, french fries and coleslaw. Regular price was $29 . On Sundays in the winter (today was the last day) it's half price 15. My husband and I split it -everything was heavenly.Nobody could've eaten the whole thing themselves. We lso had draft beer three dollars apiece. We left extremely happy with a tab of $24. Wonderful seafood.The folks working there were incredibly friendly and helpful."
1025,"Came here for lunch today and left a little dissapointed.  Nothing was bad; however, nothing was great either.  We got mostly fried things (clams, scallops, fish, fries, and onion rings). The batter came off pretty easy and was not crispy as one would expect.  The ambiance is a great improvement over the building that used to be here and the staff were really friendly.  

We will probably give this place another shot (due to staff and ambiance); however, hope things are better the second time around."
1026,Two words.  Fried. Clams. Thats why I come here.  Staff is super nice too.  All of the other seafood is also delicious and they have a collection of great sauces.
1027,"4 stars for the jumbo lobster roll. 

This roll was probably the best roll of our trip. Though other popular places were closed down due to the seasonality, this roll was a solid one that I had hard time trying to find flaws in. Fried clams and scallops were delicious as well. Just wish they were more.. crispy? Still delicious, especially with their housemade tartar sauce. Amazing stuff..

Will be back for a good roll again next time!"
1028,"When in Maine, lobster roll is a must. In the Portland area, this should be the go to for lobster roll deliciousness. You may ask, then why is it called the Clam Hut? That's because they also serve up delicious clams in a multitude of ways. The hospitality here is great, I was immediately greeted by staff and my order was taken. I ordered the lobster roll, came with piping hot fries and a dill pickle. Furthermore, I also ordered a cup of clam chowder. By the time I sat down, my food was already being brought out to me. My lobster roll was loaded with chunks of lobster and a nice, warm, toasted bun. The chowder was the perfect size and was a great appetizer before my food. Everything was so flavorful and just absolutely delicious. I'm glad i swung by here to grab a bite to eat. I highly recommend you come check this place out, I look forward to returning!"
1029,"Wow! This little gem is worth checking out!
Stopped by on a Tuesday night and the place had some people on the cute patio and takeout orders flowing in at a steady pace. Nice little seating area inside, clean and neat. Serve yourself condiments and a few beers available on tap and in cans. The Maine root soda tap has some nice selections including black cherry and the perennial favorite, root beer.

Now down to the nitty-gritty...that seafood 
The clams we tried were fried in crumbs, light and delicious. The batter was light and delicately coated each clam...you could tell it was a clam. The clamcakes are not made in house but we're still light and not cooked to death. Tasty chunks of clam and none of the grit or tough edges. The fish was lightly coated in a light flour dredge and fried golden. The fries were equally good. They know their way around a fryer. This place was originally in Kittery and we are now lucky enough to have them here in Portland.

If you are looking for good seafood but don't want a fancy sit down meal or to have to brave the crowds on the waterfront...this is the place. They also have sandwiches, burgers, salads, and even tacos....all with seafood as the star.
Clams, fish, calamari, chowder, burgers, hot dogs....just about anything that anyone in the family could want. Do your tastebuds a favor and give this new place on the Portland food scene a try, it's destined to be a favorite."
1030,"Quite pricey but great tasty food.  I got the fried clams.  The inside of the place is stark, echo-ey and noisy, I.e., no atmosphere or ambience.  Four stars for food.  Three for price, one for inside."
1031,This place was pretty close to our air bnb and was listed as being new. After hearing some of the wait times for other seafood joints we gave this a try. They had hand crafted sodas with free refills (yay). I specifically picked this place because it had lobster rolls. Mine came with a pickle and side of fries. The bun itself was on the small size but it was overflowing with lobster meat. The sauce was light so not to mask the sweetness of the lobster. It was delicious and super filling. My bf got the burger which he loved. His came with some sauces on the side and I have to say that place has the best tartar sauce I have ever had. The outdoor seating was cute and cozy. Staff was friendly. All n all a great experience.
1032,"We were in town for a few days and looking for authentic clam chowder. Based on the reviews, Bob's seemed like the place. NOPE. Definitely not the place to go. 

We ordered and when 2 ""large"" bowls of clam chowder and 2 sodas came to almost $24, my expectations were fairly high. 

Maybe they sensed we were tourists, but $7.95 for a very undersized paper bowl of Chowder, that was mostly water and potatoes, seems like robbery to me. 

If you want good Chowder, look elsewhere. We really enjoyed High Roller in the same area for lunch the next day and dinner later in the week."
1033,"Came here for a snack before hitting up Eventide. It's a small shack, or should I say ""hut"", with often design and a huge menu, filled with every seafood option you could want. We shared the seafood basket junior with fried clam strips, whole clams, and fish (plus fries of course). It  was the perfect size for the three of us to have a snack and the local hot sauce (Lost Woods) and tartar sauce made for some yummy dipping. This food was clearly freshly fried. Highly recommend a visit."
1034,"We were visiting Portland for a couple days and needed a quick lunch. Found this place and hubby got a fried clam sandwich while I opted for a salad. I found it unfortunate that about 90% of the menu was all fried food--I was hoping for a few more options for lunch entrees not battered and deep fried. But other than the span of food, the experience was very pleasant. My husband loved his sandwich. The staff were very accommodating and friendly and attentive. The shop itself is a bit small but there is a lot of natural lighting and plenty of outdoor seating options. The parking lot is small but there is plenty of street parking available."
1035,"Really friendly staff and great food! We had the fish tacos,chowders and whole clam roll, they definitely didn't skimp on the clams in the roll, and the batter was super light and delicate, but it stayed together! Restaurant was super clean, and got lots of natural light, which is really nice in the winter, we will definitely be returning!"
1036,"Normally 5 stars is reserved for the best of something I've ever had. 

This is the best lobster roll I've ever had. The roll was toasted and buttery, the perfect accompaniment to this lobster, which was perfectly cooked. My sandwich had pieces of claw meat and tender meat of the body falling off of the sandwich. And the fries were some of the best French fries I've ever had! Hot and crispy with tender insides, I had the plain tartar as a dipping sauce with the frites and it was an altogether heave experience. 

I can't recommend this place enough!"
1037,"Super choice for fresh Maine seafood, perfectly fried.  We shared the Sampler plate which was more than enough for two hungry people. The clams were perfect - small to medium (I dislike the big squishy ones), lightly fried so they're still tender and delicious.  Scallops and fish rounded out our seafood, along with fries. Coleslaw is more than an afterthought here, it's freshly shredded and delicious. 

Extra points for Maine root local sodas. My husband loved the root beer.  The only thing less than perfect were the steamers.  They weren't cooked well, some not fully opened, some falling apart.  

The inside is bright and sparkling clean.  Staff super friend,y and helpful, too."
1038,"They topped off my soda! Hey it's the little things and this counter SERVICE Clam Place gets that!  Good food, good music, Nice Vibe .... should be rockin this summer so locals now is your time ..."
1039,Me and my fiancé drove up to Maine for the day and we don't know many places to eat so we looked up places around. I personally love clams and I would highly recommend this place. The fried clams I got were by far the best I've ever had. If you are looking for amazing food I would definitely try this place out!!
1040,"I have to find another place to eat at because when I arrived in Portland Maine, last weekend, the original restaurant, Millers seafood, I want to go to is closed for the season. But luckily Bob's clam hut still open and I was able to get my fried seafood fix. The two way fried clams are awesome."
1041,"I was so hoping this was going to be my happy place when I am craving a lobster roll, and it is! It was delish as far as the lobster meat goes, fresh local meat that you can taste the difference. (I have had 3 tasteless lobster rolls this year at other high end places) ....that be said, nicely toasted hot dog bun... I would love to see a better bun, and a tad more meat , just a tad for the price so I can stop in frequently instead of making it a treat. I work , play and live in town... all that said can't wait to try the haddock and scallops!

On my second visit I had a fried haddock sandwich and it was delish!

On my third visit, I had a combo plate of scallops and fried lobster tails. I have to say, I was really Leary about fried lobster but  wow! It was so so good! I will be dreaming about it forever, lol. The scallops were good too. Expensive but good."
1042,"Had lunch at Bob's clam hut yesterday- wow what a transformation from the former space!
It's opened, fresh, white and very clean.
There are great tables outside or you can dine inside if it's hot.
Oh yeah, the food...!
I have to say I had lunch with two others and we all ordered the same thing so unfortunately I can't give a review of anything besides the great lobster rolls!
They were very good, very flavorful and made with just a little mayo and on the  toasted hot dog bun and come with French fries.
So nice to have a classic lobster roll!
The service was excellent and personable.
A nice addition to our Portland eateries!"
1043,"Great place to sit and chill. We walked from the port, bc we came in on a ship, and were able to sit down and relax. We ordered our Lobster Rolls from the counter and waited for our number to be called. The Lobster Rolls were outstanding! Customer service was excellent as well."
1044,"Very expensive - 1/2 pint clams for $23; most expensive I've seen yet but being a new restaurant in town I wanted to try it. The clams were good, batter was tasty - on the greasy side though, so much that my take out bag was soaked through. 

Given this particular area of town, they are clearly targeting tourists and people that live 'at the top of the hill'.  Certainly not affordable for most of the people that live in the direct vicinity. Maybe some community involvement in helping that area is being done but clearly not their visitors."
1045,I'd give this place two big thumbs. The food is outstanding and the service was so quick and friendly. We came our first night in Maine and we are back again...because we couldn't leave without having the lobster roll and clam strips again. The first time we had french fries and today we decided to try the onion rings and sweet potato fries. I will be back when my travels bring me to Portland again.
1046,"It's great to have a ""Clam Shack"" in Portland. The opening was a little rough but I've been back since and it's a well run operation. It's clean and the service has been good. The food is good but a little higher than average. Overall a great experience."
1047,"New place! They are great at frying things, clams, calamari and even potato's. We had a great lunch there. The clam chowder was delicious, not thick, but very good home style. They use Maine Root sodas which is great. Friendly staff, we shall see if all theses good things last, I hope so."
1048,We were in Portland running errands and wanted a quick yummy lunch. This place is great better than the one in Kittery with wonderful service and a funky style. Can't wait to come back again
1049,"Looked on the web for seafood in Portland ME and landed at Bob's Clam Hut. We were not disappointed!  Beginning with the amazing staff who expertly guided our group of five toward the family style selections - customized to our liking no less, followed by incredible tasting food and tremendous follow-up service, solidified our decision to not only to return but to highly recommend to others. If you like fried seafood, eat at Bob's."
1050,Loved this stop. Great shrimp roll and awesome Bluefin as well. They were so nice and either inside or outside space to eat was great. Everyone was so friendly.
1051,"Delish! So glad we decided to try this place. Awesome food and awesome people, and loved the well-lit low key ambiance. Would def recommend and would love to come back!"
1052,"The seafood was tasty, in a city like Portland you will not last long with those prices for small portions. Remember you are in the MECA of seafood! For the top dollar of a seafood basket 35.95 feeds 2-3 you have got to be kidding me!!!! Wow!!"
1053,"Amazing clams, the chowder was superb and the lobster roll is fantastic!  Customer service is excellent."
1054,"I have deep and abiding love for the original Bob's Clam Hut in Kittery, so I was super excited when they opened in Portland, and I really wanted to love this location. I went recently for lunch with my mom. The building itself is cute with tall ceilings and lots of windows. There are some picnic tables with outside seating, and a few off-street parking lots. The menu looks similar to that in Kittery. When we asked how much for a single crab cake (instead of the basket- single ones were not listed on the menu), the guy at the register originally told us $2.50, so we ordered 2. When my tab came to more than I expected, and I asked, he said that they were actually $6 each. I mentioned the discrepancy and he just shrugged and said, ""I made a mistake."" Um, ok. This really turned me off- and I will say- don't bother with the crab cakes (should have known). They had far too much breading on the outside, although the filling was OK. He also did not ask us which version of fried clams we preferred- Bob's or Lilian's.

I will say, the other staff we dealt with was LOVELY. Very friendly and helpful when they checked in with us. The fried clams, as expected, were delicious. 

My mom and I agreed that we are much more likely to make the trek to Kittery for the original experience, although I might return to the Portland location, especially for take-out."
1055,"Wanted to avoid crowds and an hour wait in Old Port, plus it was walkable from our Airbnb. Clean, new, super friendly and patient with a Midwestern noob. She talked us through our options, made suggestions, and went out of her way to make sure we had a good experience. We ordered a lobster roll with fries and a clam roll with onion rings then split them. I've never had either of these before, so nothing to compare it to. I will say the fries were done perfectly: golden brown, crisp, tasty and not dripping in grease. The rest of the breaded food was done lightly - none of the heavy breading found in many fried food shops. My wife, who shuns anything fried, devoured everything. We both loved it. The menu runs the gamut: lobster, clams, scallops, fish, hot dogs, burgers, tacos, etc. Prices seem spendy for seafood, but plenty of cheap options here too. When we return to Maine, Bob's will be on the list of stops."
1056,"We had the best lunch here! Everyone working there was so friendly, good local beers on tap, and the food was delicious. We shared a bunch of different dishes and highlights were the clam and fish chowders (great flavor and milky rather than really heavy) as well as the whole belly fried clams. The clams were sweet and the batter was light. It's also worth noting that almost everything you eat with / on is compostable. We'll definitely be back!"
1057,"Came here to get a quick take out lunch. Before I got there I checked out the menu online and realized there is an online order option but I said I'll just stop in and order. The couple in front of me was taking a bit but no problem on my end about that so i decided to order online while in line! I ordered a clam cake basket and it came out rather quickly but they apologized for me waiting and gave me a coupon to come back. Everything was delicious, especially the tartar sauce! I'm not sure what theirs is made up of but it definitely tasted different in a good way. Fries were nice and hot and coleslaw was refreshing!"
1058,"This place is the real thing!  Had a clam roll - the clams were lightly battered and perfectly fried. Served with a pickle and fries.  Lemon on the side and a sample of the ""hot"" tartar sauce. Great outdoor seating, very clean, and  friendly service."
1059,"This is primarily fried seafood place so go with that in mind. Excellent Fried clams , some of the best around, I had Bob's original which is for me the way to go .. just crumbs.  We split a pint of clams and a fish chowder, just enough. 

The chowder was full of stock full fish with a delicious base of milk and fish stock and butter. 

Allagash  White and Maine Beer Con Lunch were the perfect compliment. 

Friendly and enthusiastic staff."
1060,"Very disappointed. Pushy staff. Average food, skimpy portions ... at extremely high prices catering to tourists who have money to burn and don't realize within a mile they can get the same food at lower prices and better ambiance (the ambiance here is just ""new"" nothing else). For a place in the roughest part of town, where drugs flow (my neighbor found 7 needles over a month in his garbage), bums sleep on the sidewalk, this place obviously has no interest in adding to the neighborhood but trying to find outsiders who have money to burn. Good luck in the winter when the tourists aren't here! While so much money (we shared a skimpy clam basket with a handful of fries for $30, nothing out of the ordinary and this was one of the cheaper items) and all you get is a view of 2 gas stations, a parking lot, service station and maybe someone sleeping on the sidewalk. Go to DeMillos. You'll spend the same and eat more and have a view of the water.

Miss the old restaurant that was here that served the same food but had lower prices and more quantity ($15 gave me double the quantity of clams with fries). Ironically, they closed a year before this place opened, but this place has a picture up showing the old store labeled as ""before"", insinuating its the same restaurant that had a make over. It's not. Completely different. Sneaky tactic. Who would think to show a picture of a different restaurant and say it's yours? Tourists won't know. But, that's genius.

Won't be going back as long as they are pricing out the working class, pensioners, students."
1061,"We went out for dinner early on a Saturday night and we had no reservations, but we checked at Scales, which was slammed, and then Fore Street, where the wait to eat at the bar was over 3 hours. Then I remembered seeing a review that said Bob's was the real deal: an authentic Maine seafood shack. We went there and there was tons of free parking and no wait. The guy running the register was super kind and thoughtful to each guest, and was so good at hosting I assume he must have been the manager or a joint owner. We got absolutely delicious whole clams and lobster roll, a superior cole slaw,  perfect fries and top notch draft beer from Maine Brewing Company. We were so happy and relieved we high fived each other. Though our previous dinner at Fore Street was quite different, our dinner at Bob's was every bit as satisfying, and a hell of a lot more welcoming and easy!"
1062,Really overpriced.   Clams were good but every thing else was just ok.  Manager was nice and service was good.  Parking is a nightmare.
1063,"Outstanding! breading is delicious, clam strips and scallops cooked to perfection, and the tartar sauce is simply the best tartar sauce I have ever had! I even purchased a pint of the sauce to take home with me. I cannot recommend this place enough. Simply put, the best place to eat seafood in Portland!"
1064,"Does not disappoint!  If you're a fried clam fan you'll love it.  Just as good as the original Bob's in Kittery.  Crispy, sweet goodness and fries done perfectly.  Slaw was done right too!  Nice selection of craft beer as well."
1065,"Great lobster roll.  Grilled bun with just a light dressing on the lobster. Very tasty.  The fried clams had a nice light batter and were very tender. 

Great food, but just a bit pricey. $21 lobster roll."
1066,Great casual spot for delicious seafood with cute outdoor patio. The fish and chips and fried scallop plate were perfect. Staff was also super friendly!
1067,Had the fish sandwich and clam roll.  Both were excellent nice sized portions.  Fried but not greasy at all.  Staff was fast and friendly
1068,"Best lobster roll. Noah is an excellent host,  loves to explain the foods to newbies like us.  Simple and delicious food highly recommended."
1069,We were so excited to see that Bob's Clam Hut will now be delivering through 2DineIn!! Great news for us since we've loved everything about this place since it opened last summer.  This means that we won't have to struggle to get there in the bad weather...just sit home all warm and cozy and wait for it to be delivered.  We are feeling lucky today!
1070,"Pretty gosh darn good! We tried something new in Portland and were very pleased. I got the seafood platter. It was not greasy at all like some fried seafood is. I will be coming back here again. I would not recommend the lemonade though, it tasted like a whiskey sour without the fun. Definitly worth a try!"
1071,Had great expectations but was very disappointed. The portions were tiny and the price was high. Wouldn't recommend.
1072,"The clam chowder was so good, I highly recommend. I liked it because it was not too thick or creamy. I do agree that the prices were a bit high for the items on the menu, but the place was clean and food was fresh. I also ordered a clam taco that was good but I didn't write home about it. If I go back I would skip the taco and get more soup."
1073,"Yum!  Quick and friendly service and delish fresh seafood.  Bring your appetite.  Affordable and efficient.  Highly recommend platters of fried everything, with onion rings."
1074,"I was very sad to see 3 Buoys shutter its doors last year. I loved the unpretentious feel of the place and their cheap, plentiful, and delicious seafood. I was worried a new condo building would pop up in its place or a fancy overpriced wine bar. Fortunately, we got Bob's Clam Hut instead and they do quite a good job replicating what 3 Buoys offered. It still has a modest, unassuming atmosphere that is welcoming to all. They also did a great job expanding the outdoor eating area and improving the seating set up indoors. The food is pricier, but it may also be tastier. The clam strips were great and the french fries had a nice crisp to them. My wife was very impressed with their lobster roll. We had  a dark chocolate milk shake that was pretty good too although I feel like they didn't need to fancy it up with the dark chocolate. Just regular chocolate would do. Overall, I'm pretty psyched Bob's Clam Hut is here and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back many times in the future."
1075,"I love Bob's Clam Hut in Kittery but I found the Portland store not so good. First of all the parking was tough, basically non existent. The food didn't seem to be as fresh and cooked as well as the Kittery location. Disappointing."
1076,I have eaten at Bob's in Kittery many many times.... and I love it!! I have to say I'm not crazy about the Portland's Bob's. Unusual area for a seafood place and just no wonderful Bob's ambience when you walk in. It has a cold and sterile atmosphere. The clams strips that I usually enjoy were so thin and not very flavorful. The worst part was the warm cole slaw. I still love Bob's - but will still stick to the place in Kittery.
1077,Awesome.  awesome lobster roll.   Also the fried clams were to kill for.   I loved it.   Not sure why the place was not packed
1078,"We finished most of it, but my family wasn't much of a fan.  We got the medley for 2, and the scallops were the best part because it was not heavily battered and also the bites were light and not chewy.  The fish and chips were ""ok.""  While the fish tasted very juicy, the batter was way too heavy and there was just too much leftover oil hanging around the batter.  Perhaps the fryer temperature was too low?  Everything else just tasted like deep fried batter and no one in my group enjoyed the meal that much.  Service was exceptional though and it made up for the rather uninspiring presentation and taste.   While some mentioned that this place was overpriced, I didn't think so."
1079,"Only one word can explain me and my mother's experience here, amazing!! If you are looking for fried seafood anywhere in New England, THIS is the place to be. The parking lot is quite small so it took some time getting in/out (especially with a SUV). Everything, even including the drinks, is local. The cleanliness was superb even in a really intimate space. It can be a little pricey $40 for a seafood basket that me and my mom decided to split. But it was filled to the brim and overflowing with some of the best fried seafood I ever had. Will recommend to every friend and family member."
1080,"Yummy in my tummy. Great service. Tender steamed lobster. Very tasty mussels. Not sure what was in the drawn butter but that was noticeably tasty also. Allagash White made this a well rounded meal. 

The ONLY issues I had were that the only seasonal vegetable they had was corn and they  had no potatoes on stock. However, I was offered a mixed green salad with their signature dressing which had the consistency and color of warmed jam. The other issue I had is that my fingers took on an orange tinge and I'm not sure why. I'm not shy with my food however, my hands on approach didn't seem that brutal; causing my fingers to discolor. 

Bathroom was really clean too."
1081,"Red Lobster is better than this place. 

Avoid. I should have noticed every good review is from a tourist and the majority of bad reviews are from locals.  

 Everything was bad......location, decor, food, service and annoying owner.  The owner was particularly annoying.  He spend a few minutes apologizing to the people next to us after they complained they waited an hour for 2 lobster rolls.  The thing is there is no valid excuse for spending an hour making 2 lobster rolls, so everything he said was nonsense. The real problem with his excuses is his voice and that he thinks he is funny. He looks and sounds like Colonel Klink from Hogan's heroes.  (Truly)  He really should say as little as possible because his voice and demeanor are just annoying.  

The food was awful.  My son got a fried seafood plate which had no clam and had big thick pieces of fried fish in the shape of a big dill pickle, which makes it too think to fry so it was undercooked.  The lobster roll was all roll and little lobster.  It was essentially flavorless.  They forgot the chowder he ordered.

The place is located in a concrete brutalist parking garage and appears to have been decorated with ""nautical"" decor from Home Goods. 

While sitting there listening to this clown say the same exact thing about some double IPA to a number of customers I decided to Google him. It turns out he was involved in a number of ""faux Maine"" lobster shacks in California when he decided to open one in Maine. I'm not sure why. You can pull the wool over a bunch of left coasters but you can't do it here.

The whole experience and history made me think it would be like Outback Steakhouse deciding to open in the outback.  It's just stupid. Unless he has deep pockets from his CA business, this place will not last."
1082,"Never been to Maine but we are in Portland and thought we'd try it out.

Since it's the off-season there weren't a lot of folks there by the owner (Michael) was very friendly and pleasant - a big plus!

I had to try the New England Clam Chowder and the Maine Lobster Roll.  Neither disappointed!  The Clam Chowder has a great flavor and plenty of clams.  The Lobster Roll also had a great flavor and was stuffed full of lobster.  The coleslaw was also very tasty (and I'm a coleslaw snob).

My wife (who doesn't like seafood) has the sweet potato fries and they were very tasty and whatever they coat them with before frying them really makes them crispy- very good.  My wife also ordered the Mac and cheese.  She would most definitely be considered a Mac and cheese snob - many places she's ordered it at she hasn't liked it.  She absolutely love the Mac and cheese here.  I had a bite and agree - it was prepared very nicely.

We were glad we stopped here for dinner and would absolutely recommend it!!"
1083,"OMG. Get the Mac and cheese!!!  Then carefully look under the first layer of flame toasted cheese.  Spoiler Alert!!!  It's a giant chuck of lobster!!!  Second spoiler alert!!!  There's more delightful chunks hidden in that bowl that also contains approximately 5,000 calories and the key to having a great day.  
And get a lobster roll while you're at it because you're at a place called the lobster shack. When in Rome..."
1084,"Ok.....I'll start with the setup....Maine Lobster Shack is visually AMAZING! The atmosphere is fresh, crisp, and provides the perfect amount of lighting. The attention to detail can be seen in every aspect of the restaurant design...I included a picture of the table with rope design...(I love details)!! 

The service is second to none...the moment that you enter you are greeted with upbeat smiling faces....trust me that matters so much in a dining experience...it's so refreshing to see. My server (Bridget) was just delightful....she was responsive and attentive to our needs, provided recommendations on selections and made it an uber first time experience. 

(Susan) the Floor Manager was humorous and laughed as I told my boyfriend this was our ""breakup dinner"" thank you for being apart of that sensitive moment :) (However, I think you will see him again on our next visit, lol) 

The menu....oh how I wish I could have sampled every item on the menu....I will eventually...I settled in for the Haddock Sandwich with Fries, which was absolutely delicious....I followed the sandwich with a beautiful glass of Story Chardonnay... my partner had the Blackened Salmon....which lasted on his plate all of 3 minutes....he said it was AMAZING ...that's what I actually wanted but it was such a hit that day that it was the last piece (Next time, I won't sacrifice my taste buds!) 

The grand finale.....CAUTION: DO NOT LEAVE THE RESTAURANT without trying the APPLE PIE for dessert....it was absolutely heaven on a plate...the crust just melted in your mouth...it was the correct amount of comfort and sweetness, coupled with a side of Maine produced ice cream and the perfect amount of whipped cream...my boyfriend could barely stand after finishing it. 

You will regret it immensely if you don't visit this now 9 week old place! See you guys soon!! And thank you for being Rock Stars!"
1085,"We wanted to give this place a shot after reading some of the reviews and the location; however, left feeling underwhelmed and like we greatly over-paid for the meal.  This is not to say everything was bad, but nothing was that great either.  I generally do not like giving bad reviews to a new location, but this was warranted.  

On the positive, the ambiance was fresh,  enjoyable, and the servers were great, but the kitchen was extremely slow in getting food out.  It took over 30 minutes to get our order when there were only 4 other tables seated while we were there.  This is extremely slow for what amounts to maine bar food.  

As for the dishes, the lobster roll was decent; however, at $22.50, there are much better options for a lower price (Eventide, Bite into ME, etc).  The pulled pork mac n cheese was extremely dry and the least enjoyable of the items (At $19, this was probably the most over-priced).  The clam chowder was good, but not worth the visit.   The clam strips were good, but over-breaded.  For this place to be successful, they will need to speed things up and lower the price point so they are comparable to similar establishments.  Overall, we will probably not be back."
1086,"I tend to prefer old-school seafood restaurants and thought that Maine Lobster Shack looked a little too touristy. It's new and modern, but clean and with a simple menu.

I ate there two days in a row. I tried the New England clam chowder, which had a slightly sour flavor to it, as if there were some sherry in it. It wasn't bad, but not my style. I prefer a Rhode Island clam chowder with a clear broth.

I had a Casco Bay Caesar salad with anchovies, which was perfectly fine, but there was nothing distinctively Casco Bay about it. It was just a Caesar salad with anchovies.

Lobster is the star of the show, though, and the Lobsterman lobster roll is excellent. The lobster is served either warm or cold on a brioche-like New England-style roll toasted with salted butter and served with clarified butter on the side. Now, I'm a little bit of an ingredient purist and prefer a much more simply prepared lobster roll, but the Lobsterman is very, very tasty and quite delicious. I'm salivating while writing this, now.

I was lucky enough to be at the restaurant for its buck-a-shuck oyster special, which is available on Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm. I had a dozen each of the four different kinds of oysters they had on hand. Whoever curated their selection of oysters did an amazing job, because they ranged from briny and sweet to briny to less briny and creamy to not briny at all. My favorite was the Broad Sound from Casco Bay, which are briny up front and sweet on the back end. Plus, they look really sexy.

If you're interested in a cocktail with local flavor, try the Maine Mule, which is made with locally produced blueberry vodka. You can really taste the blueberries in the drink.

Will I ever be back? You betcha"
1087,"Delicious Maine lobster roll, even the coleslaw and fries that came with it were great! I'd love to try the Naked Lobster Roll too! We also split the lobster mac and cheese. The warm lobster on it was amazing but the mac and cheese was missing some cheesy, goey goodness."
1088,"First comment from the family as we walked in, ""wow, this place smells clean!""
Great friendly and quick staff (Stephanie is the best!) Food is awesome!!
Mac N Cheese was delicious. My son said the clam chowder was better than Daily Catch back in Boston.
The Lobster Roll's has massive amounts of perfectly shaped lobster claw meat. The good stuff.
Allagash beer light and refreshing. Great with the lobster roll.
Kids want to move to Portland because of Maine Lobster Shack
Thanks for a fantastic meal! Hi would recommend this place to anyone.
(I just want to go and sit next to the new customers coming in and tell them how delicious the food is )"
1089,"The food is good, closer to average in comparison to other places in downtown Portland. We went on a rainy day & it was dead. You could hear a pin drop. The ambiance is sort of like a deli."
1090,"As a spoiled New Yorker I will say this: amazing food and even better service! I'm definitely bookmaking this place for my next visit to Maine. The lobster roll was generously filled, perfectly toasted and seasoned. The scallops were juicy and steaming hot. The lobster chowder was out of this world. Very well deserved 5 stars!"
1091,"We stumbled across this place while walking in Portland. It's only been open a couple weeks. The atmosphere is great. And our server, Stephanie, made the experience wonderful.

I had my first raw oysters and they were great. The lobster roll is perfect. It's big with big chunks of beautiful Lobster. 

The onion rings are huge and the batter is perfect. 

The seared scallops were great and the macaroni and cheese was really cheesy.

To top it off, it's at a fantastic price."
1092,"Well, should have thought about this more, but was cold and hungry. So, stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. At 12:30 there was only 2 other diners in the restaurant. It is very small. The server was really nice, but couldn't recommend anything because ""she doesn't eat lobster or seafood."" O.K. Thanks for the help.
We ordered the two Lobster Mac and cheese, Lobster Roll, and Lobster BLT. Might I say all VERY overpriced for the portion you get. The meals were average. I was really hoping for more. This is my first trip to Maine, but will try again for something more exciting."
1093,"I'm sad to have to leave any sort of negative review. Unfortunately, this place is just a (pricey) tourist trap. There are far better places to visit and spend your money at. 

If you're only coming for a lobster roll, that was the one entrée that seemed passable. It was a regular size and the people in my party that ordered it seemed to enjoy it. I wouldn't say it's anything special - there are better places for lobster rolls - but there was nothing wrong with it. 

The fried clam strips were tasty and the french fries were alright. 

I would stay away from anything else on the menu, or at least ask before you order so you know what you're signing up for. 

The mussels were alright but extremely small. The owner has since explained to me that they were ""a small but more flavorful variety"" which I would say is fair. The flavor of the mussels were good and the number of mussels given were a decent amount, but again, they were tiny. The broth tasted mostly of salt. The bread included was very lackluster (I have a high standard for bread however). 

The vegetable side we chose was zucchini and squash that day. Unfortunately, it was cooked with very unpalatable seasonings and nobody in my party liked this dish - it was left mostly uneaten. 

And to me, the most unfortunate - we ordered salmon, which was $25, and was literally the size of a deck of cards on a bed of lettuce. I personally expect more for $25, but maybe this is normal in Portland. The fish was well cooked, good quality, and tasty, but it was such a tiny portion that I felt rather upset. 

Service was normal and pleasant, the food was hit or miss, and portion size for the price could really have been better. I would not return here personally."
1094,"We just wanted lobster,  steamers and salads. We were not disappointed. The steamers were excellent and so was the lobster. Salads were large. We had all three. We got the Ceaser with lobster. The dressing on the one with avocado was spicy, so don't get it if you don't like that. The one with pecans had a lot of them. 
Service was prompt and attentive."
1095,"We waited so long for their recent opening. I imagined huge pots of steaming lobsters, fresh catch being cracked open for succulent find; and throngs of customers salivating for buttery goodness!

Sorry to say. I didn't find any of this here. The place is rather cold, lacks flavor, and is often empty of customers.

I talked with the manager, Susan, who told me proudly they plan on opening Lobster Shacks across the country, even in Singapore! 
Wow, good for them! 
I liked her enthusiasm.
But I was not impressed by her product, the experience, or her business plan.
Lobster roll ran $22.00, which is a little high (2 lobsters at Docks = $26.00; 2 lobsters at Gilbert's $28.00. Lobster roll at HighRoller is $18.00. 
Rosie's is cheaper, more fun, and feels more authentic.
Oysters here are $3.00, a little steep.
The interior design wasn't anything special.
Clean, neat, franchisable.
With a life preserver on the wall!

I have been here several times: when the bisque gave a generous piece of lobster; when there was no lobster. I tried the haddock sandwich, which I liked;  the lobster roll is acceptable not special.
I like the breaded French fries, which were very crispy. 
I didn't like the coleslaw, which was dry. The lemonade which is artificial. The salad lacked any seasoning, and the avocado was unripe/hard.
I feel MLS is somehow trying to pull a fast one 
over Portland, and unknowing tourists. Offering nothing special at high prices.
With better and more interesting eating all over, I feel no compelling reason to return."
1096,"We came for lunch, had the the Mussels, Steamers (none were gritty) and Lobster Roll (naked w/butter on the side) were excellent and fresh. The wait staff was incredibly kind and friendly. 

Definitely great seafood. If we were in portland again we would return!"
1097,Decent seafood spot with decent service.
1098,Great lobster roll. My new favorite Portland restaurant. Service was pleasant and the food and atmosphere were great . Definitely will stop in on my next trip to Portland
1099,"We drove 15 minutes only to show up and find out they were closed. I understand it would not be fair to give such few stars, but when yelp and google both say they are open, and their front signage doesn't have their hours posted, it is a real lack of integrity on the management to make sure your hours are posted correctly. Someone who I assume was a manager who answered the door, said ""oh yeah, I need to post our new hours."" Sorry, not a good excuse"
1100,"We came here for lunch on a weekend trip to Portland. This is a fairly new restaurant, and located in a great location in Old Port, next to the waters. We ordered half a dozen oysters (3 of Maine, 3 of MA) to do a healthy comparison of taste but honestly we loved both. They tasted very fresh and looked beautiful as well. We also ordered the lobster roll. The bun itself was toasted very well and better than some of the ones we get in Boston that costs much more. The lobster tasted refreshing and they did not skim out. My fiancé ate it up. It came with coleslaw, which is not a dish he usually likes. So I took it and ate it all. The fries were nicely cooked as well. My favorite was the clam chowder. Wow it is one of the best I've had (San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Portland). I had to tell the waitress how much I enjoyed it. Clams were distinctive, there's a good ratio of clams, potatoes, and bacon. We slurped up everything, not sparing any leftover. I cannot wait to try this place next time we visit Portland. One of the best food experiences we had here."
1101,"I have been to the Maine Lobster shack several times. I went in today and the waitress recommended the new pork BLT.  
I was reluctant as I am not a huge fan of pork. 
It was DELICIOUS !!  A total different sand which that I have never seen.   So good!!
The new chef knows his stuff. Just awesome !
I will be back!"
1102,"Loved the food, interior, and service at the Maine Lobster Shack! The food was taking a little longer, so the chef personally came out to update us, giving us complementary soup samples, along with giving us a full size Mac & Cheese rather than a side size I ordered. 

Tasty food, awesome wait staff, and overall cozy atmosphere. Can't wait to come back to try their Blueberry Pie!"
1103,"This place has great promise and I imagine it will become wildly popular as it settles in and gets into a routine. Some dishes were fabulous: my blackened salmon, someone's lobster Mac n cheese, the lobster roll, the lobster bisque. I thought the onion rings were a little big, and they were out of multiple beers, and the blueberry pie. And it was early! And service was slow. But with the many pluses, it's worth trying, and I'm sure it'll improve!"
1104,"Avoid this place at all costs. You can get lobster rolls better, quicker and cheaper at any number of establishments in a 4 block radius. This is a tourist trap with overpriced and bland food coupled with incredibly poor service. One front end staff person to wait, serve and bus all tables and the bar. Every trip to every table was prefaced with an apology. This was the second trip to this establishment and same experience both times. This place will be closed by summer."
1105,Great lobster roll and such friendly people. It was a great place to stop at and have a bite to eat.
1106,"Came for a lobster roll and onion rings and was happy with my food. The lobster roll had a lot of lobster pieces and the bread was fresh and great. The menu looked great but I was trying to rush to a meeting so I didn't get to do much. Super cold outside, the bar looked good too."
1107,"Super rad. Stopped in on a Tuesday for lunch at the bar. Was not busy. Maine Beer Company ""Lunch"" IPA on tap. Lobster roll. Mac and cheese. Please and thank you."
1108,"This restaurant not only has delicious food, but a wonderful atmosphere, adorable decorations, and friendly staff. I had the fried clam sandwich and lobster bisque. They were incredible! The chef personally checked on my dining party to see how the food was and if we needed anything. They also have a great selection of local beer. I travel to Portland for work, and will definitely be coming back - I'm dying to try their blueberry pie!"
1109,"AMAZING ! Wow! Maine Lobster Roll Was Delicious ! Subsituted the Coleslaw with Mac n Cheese and Let Me Tell You, It Was SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! Better Than Eventide Forsure ! ahahaha"
1110,"We were very happy with our meals and service.   Arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night to find a lot of empty tables, both inside and out.  We weren't sure if this was an indicator of the food quality.  Thankfully it was not. We enjoyed a patio seat with great service.   One of us had the lobster blt and the rest had lobsters.   Everything was great- including the watermelon margarita.  The restaurant and restrooms were very cute and clean.  We would definitely return!

ETA - they had a nice kid menu as well.  Our kids didn't use it but it's always nice when it's an option"
1111,"Well I usually don't leave many reviews however, here I go. My husband walked from his job on Congress st to my job on Commercial st to surprise me and grab me some lunch for my day. As we sat to enjoy the food which looked great; starting with tasting the calmari - it was alright but mounded together in a clump of batter that we had to really tear apart. The coconut shrimp was also very soggy with greasy batter surrounding the shrimp and had a very low hint of coconut or shrimp flavor. Unfortunately the batter taste lingers well after a few hours. The next taste was of my Cesar salad with chicken; YUCK... the dressing tasted sour and the lettuce was very soggy. The dressing was mixed into the salad so maybe serve it on the side... then the worst part was the coleslaw - I love coleslaw and I was very excited to have some... if anything I was going to get full on this because I can't stomach the rest... I WAS WRONG - big mouthful - taste buds screamed - it was sour/foul tasting and almost had a taste of rotten curdled milk. I didn't even chew - just spit it out. 

At this moment we can't even stomach to finish the rest of our $40 meal and the only part we really ate was the french fries. We called the restaurant told them what happened and they had to call us back to contact the owner to see what they can do - about 15 min later they called and said they can make us something else to take or offer a gift card - uh no I am sorry we have no interest in coming back to this establishment. 

My husband walked the food back to the place and handed it to them and asked for his money back - which he never complains and usually never asks for a resolution; just moves on. The person at the front told him she was not authorized to issue refunds and the owner asked not to be bothered again..... he politely asked her to contact him at THE OWNERS convenience and call him when there is a better resolution. 

I am sure this place is great - but the customer service most definitely is not, when the food here is not great! Most people in Portland are here visiting the beautiful state and if they had gotten bad food what good would a gift card do them?"
1112,"My friend and I were up from out of town looking for some lobster and a local working  at a smoothie shop recommended this place to us. The food was good and the service was great too. The server even instructed my friend how to properly eat a lobster (being that we're from NJ and were clueless). The owner even sat down with us and talked to us for a bit which is something I look for in a small business. I def plan on returning at some point.  Overall, if you want a friendly atmosphere...I recommend this spot as it's very inviting and the staff looks like they enjoy each other as well!"
1113,The flavor of the food was fantastic and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The kids menu has a lot to offer beyond the typical chicken fingers and fries (although they offer this as well).  Only recommendation is that the food could have been a bit hotter when it reached our table.
1114,"Stopped by here as it was close to our hotel and convenient. Overall the atmosphere and service was pleasant, but the food was mediocre. Steamer clams was sandy. Lobster roll just okay. Overpriced given the quality. There are better choices in Portland."
1115,"Basically way over priced and below medicore quality of seafood in a town with endless lobster options.

Was told right out of the gate that the service was going to be slow due to having only two cooks. Woman behind us was waiting for almost an hour for two lobster rolls and a cup of soup. Meanwhile the manager chastised her for complaining about the absurdly slow service. 

We had ordered a dozen oysters, lobster roll And whole belly clams. 

Once the oysters has arrived we had noticed that Everytime we had taken a slurp into one, pieces of the shell had come on with the meat. This happened on 8 out of 12 oysters. On top of that one oyster was spoiled. 

When the main courses arrived, the belly clams I had ordered were basically bits of over friend clam strips and one belly clams. The lobster roll was very bland. 

The fastest part about our experience here was when we asked for the check. Never coming back here. Basically a tourist trap in a town where you can get amazing seafood for a better price."
1116,What?  3.5 stars?  Had a very nice lobster sandwich with ok fries and delicious coleslaw.  Also a nice lobster chowder with a good amount of chunks of lobster.  Had a couple Seadog blueberry beers which had a nice hint of blueberry.  Topped it off with blueberry pie with two scoops of ice cream which was Delicious.  Really nice and good service.
1117,"Was visiting Maine from Vermont and came upon this beautiful, creative Maine themed seafood restaurant. Was not only impressed but glad to hear the restaurant was buying their seafood locally right down the street! Service was excellent, and food was made fast. Will definetly eat there again when I visit Portland."
1118,"No frills laid back atmosphere + friendly staff + melt in your mouth lobster rolls = super happy tummy. Excited for next trip to Maine, I'll be coming back here for my lobster fix!"
1119,"New place in town! A great value, particularly the oyster basket which, for $14 will fill you up. 
Excellent lobster rolls, perfectly full of fresh meat. Delightful absence of TV's, making conversation possible. Add a delightful, articulate, funny, red-headed manager who tears around like a whirlwind and always has a smile on her face (and a witty remark), and you have an unusual ambience of leisure and hyperactive fun.  
There is a nice selection of beers and some ""just and potent"" cocktails. A great place to start or wind up an evening of fun. No negatives!"
1120,"What a great fine! This small little place doesn't seem like much on the outside but watch out and go! The food was great and Susan was so sweet and friendly, she made you feel at home.
If you are here, you must go! We will be back !!!
Thank you for a great dinner and evening!"
1121,Several visits and all I've had are the lobster rolls but that is what I came here for. Warm grilled rolls for added flavor packed with huge mounds of some of the best chunky lobster bits I've ever had. Pure lobster flavored without all the work of fighting to get the meat out of the shell yourself.  Nice patio made for great place to relax after a long day.
1122,I really like the decoration of the restaurant. It is really cozy and comfortable. We ordered both the naked and Maine lobster roll. The lobster is really sweet and they didn't put a lot sauce in the Maine roll so you can taste the freshness of the lobster. I also ordered the lobster bisque but I wouldn't recommend that. I've tasted better ones in Chicago.
1123,"An underwhelming experience, restaurant was not well staffed as food took over an hour to come out. Lobster bisque was uninspired, with minimal taste. Compare that to the lobster stew we had earlier in the day up the coast...for same price...and you feel underwhelmed. The bisque and stew are two different types of ""soup"" so one does have to be aware of this. 

Had lobster Mac and cheese as well, lobster was not nearly as fresh tasting as I would have expected. It may have been overcooked. Waitress was nice and tried her best, but the kitchen couldn't keep up with the volume of folks. Which would have been fine if restaurant had been full, but it wasn't. In fact, it was half empty.

Prices were a bit extreme for the quality, left feeling unfulfilled and wishing we had chosen another restaurant. Hopefully our experience was a one off one, and not the norm."
1124,Love this lobster roll! One of the biggest I've ever had! Great food and love that they have wine on tap.
1125,"Came here twice with the kids. Sat on the sidewalk patio. Great people watching on a not too trafficky street. Recommend the lobster rolls, oyster po' boy and crab cakes. Everything we tried was fresh, tasty and cooked right.  And they serve Maine brewing co beer. Great option that both kids and adults will enjoy."
1126,"A disappointing meal to say the least. We ordered lobster rolls and lobster BLT. The lobster meat was clearly not fresh and had been frozen. It was waterlogged and devoid of any flavor. The lobster rolls even had some ice chips left from the freezer on the lobster. I expect better from a restaurant in Maine with ""lobster"" in its name, especially for a lunch that cost over $100 for 3 people."
1127,"This place is new and so far so good. Check out their drink specials- the manager (forgot her name, sorry!) has made her own moscow mule and mimosa creations. The decor is very cute and everything looks very fresh.

I cant speak to the food but the drinks are delicious.

The only thing is that this place is definitely more expensive than some of the other establishments around."
1128,"I've given this place a shot twice.  I'm not one to normally leave a bad review I try to give every place the benefit of the doubt but I feel this is warranted.
Both times that I've been into this restaurant in the last  months the service has been very slow. When asking questions about the menu I felt like I was bothering the server. The kitchen was out of a few items that I was not aware of until after I ordered them. The restaurant wasn't very busy and it took a long time for our food to come out. I could hear the cooks talking and laughing.  Possibly why things took so long.  
We never got our chowder.  The lobster roll lacked flavor and we had to ask twice for our drinks.  
I will not be returning to the Maine Lobster Shack."
1129,One of our favorite places to go!! We love the food and the atmosphere! This place can get very busy during certain times of the year but the wait is always worth it!!
1130,Accommodated my party of 20 same day a half-hour before. The food was delicious. My first time having Maine lobster and I don't think I could've picked a better place. The waiters were very attentive and I'm so happy to have picked this place.
1131,Great service. Called in at 5 to try to fit in 34 people and they were very accommodating. They set up the entire inside of the restaurant for us and the service was amazing. Great seafood as well. Typical lobster and fish.
1132,"My 3 teenagers and I visited on a Wednesday night. Very nice location with outdoor seating available. We had salads, clam chowder, a lobster roll, lobster blt and Mac and cheese amongst the 4 of us. Food was ok, service was excellent."
1133,"This place is great~ extremely clean and fast. We had a great waitress that was super helpful with our choices. We ordered a Maine lobster roll, half a dozen of Oysters and fried calamari. Everything was so good! The fried calamari is definitely shareable (2-3 people) it was a really big basket! Will be back again! :)"
1134,"I can't say enough good things about this place! I was in town for the week so I made it my mission to have a few lobster rolls and the one I had at Maine Lobster Shack blew all the others out of the water! I also had the lobster bisque and apple pie, which were both fantastic as well. But truly the best part was the AMAZING service. Susan, the manager and bartender, was so friendly and made for great company while enjoying my meal. If I ever make it back to Portland this place is #1 on my list."
1135,"I went over Memorial Day Weekend and the food was absolutely delicious! The lobster roll was filled with lobster meat and cooked to perfection. I also got mac and cheese on the side and that was fantastic. The service was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Susan and her team did a fantastic job even though there was a slight hiccup. The place was so good, that my boyfriend wanted to go back the next day! Def worth a visit!"
1136,I came out to the east coast from Reno and this place had THE BEST lobster roll out of the 5 places I tried in Maine and Boston!
1137,"Nice fresh sea food! Had the mussels and calamari.
Small place, nice bar for the lonely travers.
Great service!"
1138,"After tirelessly googling ""best lobster roll in Portland Maine"" this place came up with a lot of stars but few reviews.  That is because it's only been opened 6 weeks!   The naked lobster roll was AMAZING!!!   ALL KNUCKLES AND CLAWS!  HUGE CHUNKS OF TENDER LOBSTER!!  The slaw was on point and the clam chowder and the lobster bisque we're both super amazing!  Plus they had Maine Beer Company Lunch on tap which was super delicious!!!!"
1139,"Went last night for take out. Lobster roll was delicious simple and crisp buttery roll. Fried scallops were amazing, and came with a very tasty tartar sauce (I'm not usually a tartar fan but I loved this one!) Will definitely be back!"
1140,"Great spot - great beer selection, wine on tap, delicious lobster roll and mac and cheese with lobster. Perfect blueberry pie. 
Friendly people - will def go back!"
1141,"** Update **. I received a kind message from the owner explained they just opened 3 weeks ago and that I must have received an old menu as their new menu states that chowder is served in cups and mugs. He said their ""bowl"" size is 12 oz and invited me to return for a complimentary bowl of chowder."
1142,Great fisherman's lobster roll!  Stopped in during a downpour and had great service and good food!
1143,"Stopped by this place a couple of nights ago during our east coast travels. Great place, staff was very nice and helpful. Food was yummy. Had a lot of fun meeting and visiting with the owners. Very nice people and very nice place. When we get back to Portland we will definitely be stopping by again! Just wondering though...are the purse hooks up yet under the bar???!!! Lol. Thanks for a great time and dinner to you all"
1144,"Absolutely awful experience I went to the restaurant with a friend  to try the food and drinks at which time I met the owner and manager we had a nice conversation and I agreed to come back and further discuss having my husband's birthday party at the restaurant the following month.  I came back two weeks later to confirm the reservation and table fee amount for Sunday, June 10 we were all in agreement and I left.   My mother called to pre-pay the food and drinks as a gift at which time she was informed That they were not honoring the reservation because they felt like they could get 20 turns out of the table they also told my mother they lost my phone number and could they get it from her so they could call me. I reached out to the restaurant and asked what was going on at which time I was told a day and a half before my husband's birthday party which out of town guests are attending that they were no longer willing to reserve the table as previously discussed. I will never go back to this restaurant again and don't recommend it to anyone"
1145,"Overpriced for what you get. I got the lobster bisque with no lobster chunks in it. The lobster was probably at the bottom of the pot and they only scooped my soup from the top. It was expecting a larger soup since I ordered the larger soup portion. It came in a small mug which wasn't much larger than the ""cup"". The waitress didn't even give the soup mug to me with a saucer, so it dripped on the table and no where to rest my crackers. Would not go back. Definitely not worth it."
1146,"This was very, very good.  The clam chowder was the best!  We shared a 1 1/4 lb lobster with steamers, fries, and corn on the cob.  Perfectly cooked.  Service was courteous and friendly.  Most definitely recommended and I would return for sure."
1147,"We came here on our first night in Portland (ever), for a quick traditional lobster roll before headed back to our hotel for the night. We were so impressed with the food as well as the service that we came back again 2 days later, despite all the other lobster choices in town. This time, we sat at the bar and were served by Susan. The place was packed and it was great to watch all the delicious food coming out, and the happy customers enjoying it. Our double baked lobster rolls came out (so perfect we didn't even need the mayo or oil), and I accidentally dropped a huge piece on the floor. (These rolls are jam packed with huge lobster chunks - definitely great quality for your money). I made a casual comment to Susan as she was cleaning up about this, and she came back with our check as well as an even bigger chunk of lobster meat to make up for my fallen piece. Totally unnecessary but made us love the place even more.  Great customer service like this is what makes places so enjoyable. We are even considering stopping in tomorrow before our flight home for one last roll :)"
1148,"Very fast service. Best lobster roll we've had in our last 3 days in Portland. They also have a ""maine mule"" which is based on a local blueberry vodka. Very tasty!"
1149,"Great idea to come here after the Old Port Half Marathon for a little lobster BLT!  The service was excellent, the atmosphere was chic and relaxed.   Maine mules were a hit along with the lobster BLT.  The clams were the best with a special broth...yum!  We all enjoyed everything and will definitely be back soon! I would recommend this place.  It was a great way to end a perfect day running Portland!"
1150,"We were excited that there wasn't a wait for dinner on a Saturday. Once in the door we were seated and my sister was confronted about her service dog. The sever ( possibly manager) rolled her eyes and walked away.  Our waitress was very pleasant! We attempted to order drinks and I asked about the mules that were 50% off (from the board the was right inside the door). She informed us that those were the specials from yesterday and they didn't change it and put it out because of the rain. Tgis was a but frustrating. Warning, the pulled pork I spicy.  The table behind us was large (14 to be exact) the same waitress that was rude to my sister asked them whether their check would be all together or separate. Their response was separate and she did the same eye roll that she gave my sister. She took their drink order and when she returnes she said ""I'm going to just go them together and split them later"". I thought, really, a table of 14. We planned to stay for dessert but decided to leave."
1151,I really enjoyed the lobster roll and raw oysters! If I would visit Portland again I will try some more dishes here!
1152,Lobster roll was overpriced & underwhelming. Clam roll was cold. Average clam chowder with more potatoes than clams. Disappointed
1153,"We went in for a late lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The people were very nice. The place is spectacular with the nautical theme of Portland!  The restaurant will be open for 3 weeks on May 4th, but the staff and quality of the food  -  you feel like it has been around for years!  Great job ! Look forward to coming back!"
1154,"When in Portland this restaurant is a must.  We made reservations ( I would recommend) and had the best seat looking out the window.  The service was superb.   Everything was cooked to order and there was no rushing..   
We had one of the specials, pork tenderloin with perfectly done mashed potatoes which was excellent and a lot.  Also, the linguini with red clam sauce which was plentiful and very tasty .  
I would highly recommend going there."
1155,"OMG!  What a find and by accident.  The famous oyster place down the street had an hour wait, so we wondered down the street and found Ribollita.  It was our lucky night.  
The cuisine is home cooking world class Italian.   Wine list is adequate and reasonably priced.  In fact, get there soon as surely they'll be raising their prices to match other places in town.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is intimate.   We're lucky tonight!"
1156,"Carve 3 hours out of your night to go here.

The food was good.  Not great, but good.

Service was good.  Not great, but good.

We were here for well over 2-hours for a relatively simple meal.

Initially the wine and appetizer came out relatively quickly.  Then, 45-minutes to an hour later the main course came out...  (we were done with our wine at this point).

And it also took a very, very long time to simply settle up the bill.

Good food?  Sure.  Worth all the waiting, and time, and sitting around.  No.

The kitchen and restaurant were not that busy, so really no credible reason for the lengthy delays."
1157,"Lacked flavor.  We were disappointed in our meals.  Portions were big, but flavor was small.  We were expecting a lot more based on the great reviews.  It smelled great when we walked in and were excited to try the food.  We were a party of 2 and it took almost 1 hour to get our food after we ordered.  We won't be back."
1158,"We recently visited Portland for 1 week. This was easily my favorite restaurant of the week. I enjoyed the small atmosphere, great service and authentic food. I ordered the scallops which were accompanied by their homemade pasta with a light red sauce. My husband had the clam linguine with a marinara sauce. Both were outstanding. The wine selection was perfect for the menu. This is a true jewel because even the cost was a true
value relative to the quality. Make reservations."
1159,"Our group of 8 had a fabulous family-style dinner here on a Wednesday night (make reservations, even on week nights!) and Ribollita has very easily become one of my favorite restaurants in Portland. 

A romantic, cozy little restaurant located right beside Duckfat, Ribollita is excellent for a date night or a night out with good friends. Everything from food to service, to atmosphere was stop on. Prices were also very reasonable. Dinner came out to be a little over $40 per person, and that is including sharing 5 appetizers, one entree each, and 3 desserts (no alcohol). 

I'd recommend:
-Mussels: A big plate of fresh mussels swimming in perfect garlicy broth - the extra baskets of bread were polished off over and over again thanks to this broth
-Calamari: Fresh, juicy squid in a light, melt-in-your-mouth batter. It comes with an aioli (that is pretty heavy), but it tastes great on its own or with some lemon on top. 
-Caprese salad: Fabulous fresh ingredients and thick tart balsamic. 
-Fish stew: This fish stew is actually seafood stew in a spicy broth. Everything was so fresh and cooked perfectly, including the scallops, clams, and fish. 

The tiramisu and flan were recommended as all-time favorites. We didn't try the tiramisu. 
-Flan: The thickest flan i have ever had. It tastes just like cheesecake.  
-Ice cream with biscotti: A custard base ice-cream with nutella swirled in, this ice cream was tasty. 

Can't wait to return and share Ribollita with loved ones!"
1160,Portion sizes are very generous. I ordered the Ribolita soup the namesake of the place and that was enough for a meal. Seafood was fresh and great flavors. The chef clearly works hard on his dishes. I think they'd make more money if the reduced the portions though lol
1161,Amazing food!!  Intimate atmosphere. Truly a destination location. Prices are more than fair.  You're going to love Ribollita's.
1162,"Excellent in every way!   First time to this tiny gem
but won't be the last. Authentic Italian cooking,
huge portions, delightful waiter.  All handmade on the tiny premises as well.  Definitely will go back!!"
1163,"I ordered the Tuscany fish stew, which I found to be delicious. Reasonable prices as well. My only reservation in giving a 5 star review is that Ribollita totally messed up our reservation. We made reservations for a party of 7 at 7pm and were not seated until 7:30pm. A large party ahead of us was using the only table sufficiently large for a party of more than 5. The waitress and restaurant handled the situation very well, though, providing us with complementary appetizers and drinks while we waited. If you're a party of more than 5, be aware that your reservation might not be strictly accommodated. However, thanks to the great service and delicious food, my overall experience at Ribollita was very good."
1164,"This place is authenticate. You're not getting high wnd Italian , but it's homemade and delicious. The calamari was breaded real lightly with a zesty cherry aioli.  Then the house specialty salad of mezcal greens with peaches and candies almond and goat cheese was delicious. Then the main meal of pan seared gnocchi with sweet Italian sausage and Charred spinach was delicious. Now for the ending, the  tiaramasu had an excellent coffee flavor. Excellent meal all around."
1165,"Interesting little place, almost like an Italian-American School style, looking forward to coming here again. Had the antipasto which was more free form than traditional and next was their namesake soup, our favorite dish of the night. It was done in a constructed style where a base of mild, flavorful tomatoes, zucchini and carrots and bread soup served as the base to fresh cooked spinach or maybe it was chard strands which again were topped with an amazingly flavorful olive oil and grated cheese. Yum! Main course was linguini with seafood using red sauce, fantastic because we could tell the sauce was made from fresh not canned and the seafood fresh from the boat."
1166,"Ribollita was a pleasant surprise that left me nodding my head up and down saying to myself a couple of times
""damm that was good"". 

We came to Ribollita pretty much due to a trifecta. We ate at Duckfat which was right next door. Our hotel the Residence Inn Marriott was around the corner and of course the reviews on Yelp. 

We made reservations early since the day before we had gone to a couple spots and the wait time was about 30 to 45 minutes and we wanted to eat as soon as we got to the restaurant. We had tried just about everything else in Portland, Maine except Italian, so it was a perfect opportunity to visit this little gem. 

I ordered the Tortellini en Brodo Zuppa, Carmelized onion tart as a Antipasti and for Cortorno we went with the Scallops with Prosecco cream and fettuccine. 


Tortellini: 

Heaven sent! The soup was rich and hearty! It had what appeared to be white beans along with hand filled pasta with chucks of tomato, spinach and butter squash. You can't forget the creamy texture of the tomato sauce with olive oil, along with the mixture of spices such as oregano, parsley and rosemary. It was so good I had the wifey sticking her spoon in my bowl the entire time. Very hearty and filling for a starter. 

Onion Tart: 

I was surprised by this dish. The waitressed advised us this appetizer takes about 20 minutes to cook but she assured us it was well worth it and man was she so right. The tart was came in a pie format, crusted at the bottom with  very rich caramelized onions on top sprinkled with truffle and goat cheese. Not all Italian restaurants serve this dish and I was very thankful I was able to try it here because it was very delicious. The onions were very rich and tasty and pretty much dissolved in your mouth if you're not an onion lover than this dish isn't for you however I simply love garlic and onions and this dish was packed with that. The goat cheese on top added a very creamy texture and an offsetting flavor to the onion it was a great surprise, the best part about it you can eat it like a pizza. 

Scallops: 

What triggered me to order this dish was the couple next to us. Immediately once I saw the dish I told my waiter,  I want that !!! The pasta had the perfect texture and smoothness yet with enough consistency to wrap around your fork without slipping away which fettuccine is famous for in sauce. However, that sauce was the show stopper. I love the Prosecco Cream which appeared to have pieces of very thin almonds or pistachios which gave it a great crunchy flavor believe it or not but not overpowering. The scallops were a hit as well, very tender and soft and you can taste the freshness. They were seasoned and cooked just right. 

I left not expecting to have the fantastic meal I had I was completely caught off guard and bookmarked it right away so I can give it a amazing review. If you're in the area and you're pretty much lobster'ed out. This is the place for you."
1167,"I love this Italian gem. Never disappoints. Small cozy restaurant that keeps their specialties on the menu year round and adds specials every night. Tonight I had a seasonal peach salad on greens with sugared nuts and a slab of ricotta. Really light and delicious. My entree was the pan fried gnocchi. I always say ill try something else, but when it comes time to order I always blurt out ""I'll have the gnocchi"" it's so consistently good. Raspberry ricotta cake and a cappuccino and I was all good."
1168,"Went here for a birthday celebration for my aunt, and I was so impressed with how accommodating this restaurant was for our party of 13. None of us had been here before, but we wanted some homemade Italian food and found it to have good reviews on Yelp. First impressions were it was easy to find parking, the restaurant is clean and just enough fancy that you feel like your going out somewhere special but don't necessarily need to dress up. It is pretty small, but I think they've done well with the space they have. It was easy to make a reservation, and they were accommodating and honest with us that it would be a tight squeeze when we wanted to increase our reservation from 10 to 15 the day before. I appreciated the honesty about that, as not all restaurants would tell you the truth about less than stellar seating arrangements on the chance you cancel your reservation. Luckily, only 13 people ended up coming which worked out better because the staff were right, it would have been VERY tight to fit 15 people in. Bob was our waiter and he was so personable and went out of his way to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves. When we asked for Moscato wine (that is not on their wine menu) he went out of his way to get us a bottle and chill it quickly from their stores in the basement. What restaurants really do that kind of thing anymore?!?! It was so nice and we very much appreciated it. He made sure that our drinks were always filled and brought us some more bread when we quickly went through the first round but were still starving and waiting for dinner. He also split up our checks into seven separate slips, even though when we asked in the beginning how it would work best for him when it came to the check and he nicely told us our options and that splitting into individual slips would be the least easiest for him, he still did it!!! Again, another reason I was so impressed with the service here. 
As far as the food, everything is homemade and you can tell that the pasta is fresh. The menu is diverse, prices are reasonable, and the kitchen was very accommodating to make changes to some of the dishes for us. Would've loved some more seasoning in most of the dishes we had, maybe putting little salt and pepper shakers on the tables would be a good compromise for those that like a little more salt. Those that got the gnocchi said it tasted like hash browns which they weren't really expecting. The food did take a while to come out; we were there for a total of 2.5hrs. I wasn't upset with that, as it is a small kitchen and we were a large party, so of course it was going to take a while! Bob kept the drinks coming so we were enjoying ourselves, and though a couple of debbie downers in the group were growing impatient with the wait for the entrees, I think that the kitchen did well getting all of our meals out. Overall, Ribollita's left a good impression and I would love to try this place again."
1169,"We came here this past week for the first time, we will be back! 
For the price this is a steal. I felt as though I was eating food that was made by a family member at home. The quality and care put into the dishes was amazing. Great flavors! And the bread!!! The bread was sooooo good. I got scallop fettuccine, it had a perfect balance of creaminess but not too heavy. My husband got the short rib, it was falling of the bone and had a delicious savory sauce served over mashed potatoes. The wait staff was very professional and attentive. This is a very small place and the tables are close together but its totally worth going here."
1170,"Yelp really steered me in the wrong direction for this restaurant. I have no idea how this restaurant is so highly rated but it really doesn't deserve anything above two stars. I've been in town for about a week on business with three other coworkers so I did some research on good restaurants in town. Reading the reviews I though ""oh this would be a great Italian restaurant to check out"" but I was so wrong. 

To begin, the chairs were very small and uncomfortable and the service was very slow. There were only two other tables being served so it's not like the waitress was overwhelmed. 

Appetizers: my one coworker got soup and the other for calamari. Calamari was rated just okay, and my other coworker said the soup was very bland and did not finish it. 

Dinner: I got the fettuccini alfredo. I could tell that the sauce was home made but it didn't have too much flavor. I asked for fresh cracked pepper to make it better. My one coworker got the gnocchi with peas and prosciutto. First of all the gnocchi was completely over cooked and tasted like hash browns. Also it's served with snap peas... not the regular peas you'd imagine to be served in a pasta dish. I would never recommend anyone have this dish unless it was for breakfast served with a side of eggs. My other coworker had the penne arrabbiata, or as he called it, soup. The whole dish was just a ton of sauce that didn't really seem to stick to noodles. Really, he ate all of the noodles and his entire plate was still full but full with sauce.

We didn't even ask to see the dessert menu because the appetizers and entrees were just horribly disappointing. Seriously don't waste your time or money going here."
1171,"I have been on a hunt for good italian pasta at Portland and I decided to give this resturant a try. My friend told me the homemade pasta are really well made and favorful. Today my friends and I came at about 5pm and the place wasnt crowded at all. We were able to get our seats immediately. 
We ordered calamari as appetizer and I split the peach salad with a friend which was perfect portion for the stomach to have enough space for the entree. I ordered the scallop fettuccine with moscato cream sauce and I really liked the dish. I have a sweet tooth and if you are craving something on a sweeter taste for the dish, I would recommend this entree. 
The service was nice and overall resturant atomsphere was quiet and intimate. Great for date nights!"
1172,"I had the best service at Ribollita. My server, I believe her name is Celia, was very attentive and cared very much about our experience. Our food was hot and delicious and would totally recommend to anyone in the Portland area!"
1173,"I've been here about ten times over the last ten years...my first review. As a precursor, I'm first gen Italian, a foodie, and a good Italian cook. This restaurant is the classic example of rustic, casual, Italian fine dining. Literally everything we ate was a great blend of classic Italian fare, amply portioned, and value priced. 

Our apps include the mussels, traditionally served with garlic and seafood broth, with great dipping bread. The salumi appetizer has classic Italian salami treats, with all the sides to make it a delicious shared finger food appetizer. Our table had the ribolita soup, and the cupalette with chicken stock soup...both scratch made and delicious, as I sampled both. 

Entree items included the Chicken of the woods mushroom risotto, the star of the night, one of the best samples of a dish I've had in a long time. My son loved it, the mushrooms were delicate, and had a lobster texture and taste, enhanced with a drizzle of truffle oil. I had the pork Ragu pappardelle pasta, a deliciously rustic dish, without tomato sauce accents, the pork juiciness made the dish. Others had roasted chicken puttanesca, scallops linguine with a rich, moscato cream sauce, and a huge seafood rustic stew. The scallop dish I sampled had a rich, sweet, wine based sauce that was decadent....absolutely delicious. 

Most entrees are under $20, the wine list has 25 Italian wines, many that I own in my wine cellar...the markup is nominal. 

I give this place five stars....the staff is attentive, the menu is expansive, the food is excellently prepared and delicious, and the pricing is very reasonable. 

I'm a big fan"
1174,"The food was decent but not extraordinary. 
Don't ask the server for food recommendations... she doesn't seem to have any."
1175,"The specials were amazing. We had the citrus arugula salad, chicken saltimbocca and the homemade bolognese pompadour. simple flavors that stood strong in their respective dishes. Very good meal. Salad, two entries and a bottle of wine for 80. Can't really find a better scenario."
1176,"Wow. And not in a good way. That was easily the worst calamari we've ever had, the bread was stale and the mussels were bland. As was the service, if I'm being generous. Not good."
1177,"Came here for dinner with the family one night and it was reasonably okay. The pasta was honestly garnished with too many different items and flavors and drowned everything in the dish. However the chops were very good, moist and juicy. The price was overall quite expensive for what we had, but it being a relatively new restaurant I think it was worth trying. Would I go back again? Not particularly, and I would not recommend this highly to visitors who have ample Choice elsewhere."
1178,Pasta was cooked to perfection. The dessert was also fantastic. The service was polite and attentive. Would absolutely recommend eating here
1179,"Very tiny authentic restaurant, though I found the food not very good. One waiter for the entire place. Toward the end the place reeked of bleach. I won't be back. - update 4 hours later I'm still miserable from the food. Have been nauseated for hours."
1180,"My husband and I started with the caprese salad and the pistachio mussels.  Both appetizers were delightful and plenty of food. My go to is usually either the antipasto or the ribollita soup, but we decided to mix it up and it didn't disappoint. Our entrees were the fettuccine Alfredo(which the waitress offered sausage or chicken with, these options aren't on the menu) and the gnocchi.

The things I love about ribollita are the prices ( a lot lower than your average old port restaurant, yet still great quality food) , their consistency, and the fact that they have so many appealing items on their menu.  My only observation was that the fettuccine Alfredo portion seemed a little small, this was not an issue for us because we over ordered in the app department!  Go to ribollita for lovely service, a romantic atmosphere, and a carafe of their house red."
1181,"This is my favorite Italian place in Portland hands down. I've been coming here for a long time and I still get that happy/giddy feeling when I go here. It's warm, small and the people and food will keep you coming back. 

The Ribollita soup is something I crave all through the year.  It's full of veggies & bread and once you have it you understand why the place is named after it. 

The pan-seared gnocchi, prosciutto & peas is to die for and will really give you a new respect for gnocchi. (If you didn't love it already like I do & eat it like a boss) 

Being able to see the chefs cook is great and having attentive waitstaff is amazing.  

Make reservations now. Do it."
1182,"Absolutely phenomenal. Waiter was attentive, helpful and so pleasant to be around. Warm cozy atmosphere with great wine selection. Closest you can get to the North End in Boston... if you want Little Italy in Portland, this place is where it's at. The Tuscan fish stew is to die for, as was the scallop fettuccine with moscato cream sauce. Everything is reasonably priced. We walked away very pleased and will return very soon. FIVE STARS."
1183,"Restaurant week advertised vegan options - Dessert and Main course vegan options not presented. 
Service was terrible.  After serving food, customers were left unattended, didn't even have spices - salt and pepper on the table.  
Salad and Entree items were lacking in taste and creativity.
Very congested place with tilted tables. 
Ambiance and lighting were the only descent aspect."
1184,"I wanted to like this place so badly, and while I really did enjoy the atmosphere and the physical restaurant itself, there were quite a few issues with the food and service which is why I had to give it two stars. I also noticed while we were there that things have changed recently (based off of other customers): no more ""roosters"" of wine, and the prices are now higher than what appear on the website. 

Let's start off with the food. My boyfriend and I chose this place to come for a special occasion dinner based off of the wonderful food reviews we read. I love Italian food, and this place seemed to be delicious food for a great price. We went in with high expectations which we hoped to be filled. We ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer. I was disappointed with this, especially since caprese is pretty hard to screw up. The mozzarella tasted very cheap, the tomatoes were extremely small, and the pine nuts and lettuce underneath seemed unnecessary and didn't add to the dish. I believe that you shouldn't put anything on the plate unless it enhances the dish (these did not). The plate looks pretty but does not live up to that. For dinner I ordered the pan seared gnocchi with prosciutto and peas. Now, I make gnocchi all the time and I could tell this was homemade, but they weren't boiled before searing them and this created a hard outside and an unpleasant mushy inside. The dish was dry and needed something else like a sauce. There was also no seasoning!!! I took it to-go so I could add some salt and pepper when I got home (which I could not do there because there is none on the table and the service was so bad that I couldn't ask for any), and once I did the dish was substantially better. My boyfriend ordered the chicken saltimbocca which was not very good either. It was a small piece of chicken with beans and kale underneath...a very small portion. The chicken was pretty tasteless, no sage and the prosciutto inside was a small sliver. The beans were good though. 

Now onto the service. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who seated us early since we got there before our reservation which was great. Our water was promptly filled but after that the service went downhill. Our waitress seemed off from the start. She rarely looked us in the eye or ever came over. It seemed as if she was treating the other tables much better (the tables are close together so you can hear everything) and offered them salt and pepper and came over more frequently. We wanted to order dessert but the service stopped us from wanting to. The word I can use to describe her was aloof. She was on her phone and chatting with other service and kitchen staff right after we asked for something which bothered me. The other waitresses seemed to be hustling for their tables so this is only about one server. The hostess was great and filled our waters often. 

I would give the food a 3 and the service a 2, so this is really 2.5 stars. I want to give it another chance but I don't think we will."
1185,"Cute and cozy Italian restaurant right next to Duckfat.

Definitely had a lot to offer and thought the portions were pretty generous. Roast Chicken Puttanesca was delicious but I think I should've tried the Ragu Beef. Tomatoes felt slightly watered down but that bad overall.

Knocked off a star since we were seated next to the door when there were other open seats and it was somewhat annoying with a waitress creeping over to the corner to text message every other few minutes."
1186,"Food was pretty good and portions were great. We started off with a special bean salad that was simple, but yummy. It had green, wax, and Italian? beans. Next, I had fettuccini with scallops and moscato cream sauce. My husband had the beef cannelloni. Entrees were good as well.

Reason for 3 not 4 stars. There was no highchair. We made due sitting at the hightop. That was fine. However, the service was AWFUL!!! We sat for 10 minutes before the waitress even came over. She then poured my wine and my husband didn't get his until 5 minutes later. The food took forever to come out and then another long wait for her to come back and run our card. We had our 2 year old with us, so time was an important factor for us. I overheard another waitress offer free dessert to another table that was waiting for their food. They were already there when we arrived. I can't even imagine. 

I am sorry NOT sorry, but going out to eat is a luxury. We weren't in a 5 star restaurant, but pretty sad when you can get better service in a chain restaurant. They need to seriously step up their game. 2 chefs 3 waitresses for a busy restaurant is not ok."
1187,"I'll be honest that I'm usually wary of the restaurants near the port in Portland. I find many over priced, too crowded, and too hyped up. I have had EXCELLENT food in other areas of the city, and just don't find the port area worth it ... usually. 

I love the location of this restaurant. It is in the same building with Duck Fat, and near a couple of small groceries. It's slightly off the main port drag. Ribollita is a small restaurant with not more than 20 tables. They have a solid menu of authentic Italian dishes. I appreciated that I was able to keep the meal fairly reasonably priced and left with leftovers. You can get away with an appetizer and pasta or main dish at this restaurant, unlike others in the area. 

I started off with the signature dish, ribollita, which was a wonderfully flavored, hearty soup. I finished with a hubbard squash risotto. It was beautifully presented, studded with fresh cheese that added a nice sharp flavor to the smooth risotto. I could taste the squash in the dish, and it added to the texture. My companion enjoyed his choices, and we both thought the Peroni beer went down well with our dinner. 

The service time was just right for this kind of homemade food (unlike some of the restaurants in the area where the wait time makes for too long nights). I'll definitely go back to try some other dishes."
1188,"Very good but food, but waits between courses was REALLY long. Had the putinusca, which was delicious, but hardly any pasta and lots of sauce. I don't think i will be back. Not overall impressive. I wish them well."
1189,Excellent!  Small and cozy place with excellent service and a menu with something for everyone.  Amazing fresh pastas.  Will definitely be back.
1190,"We had not been here is awhile until last night - but on and off, we have been going to Ribollita for about 20-years. In hindsight it was ahead of it's time--Local produce, an open kitchen, an exposed brick wall and a very casual-bistro dining feel.

Last night - had the stuffed fried zucchini blossoms, a little heavy on Ricotta but the blossom seemed to just disappear when eaten - a neat mix of light and heavy in the mouth. The fish dishes we had were fabulous and the tomatoes worked of course.  It's Maine, we have tomatoes like this for only about 6-weeks total so it's no surprise.

Nice service, nice wine, nicely priced, nice expresso to cap it off. I feel like I should thank the cooks at the end of my meal--like they all know my uncle Mike or something. Friendly - I don't expect museum food when I come here - it's often in a broth or sauce - but it's always good.

I'll look forward to returning in colder weather for the Osso Buco if they still have that on the menu from many years ago."
1191,"I had been hearing about Ribollita's homemade pasta for ages now, and after a semi-recent obsession with fresh pasta, I was ready to check this place out! 

Chris L & I walked in on a summery Friday evening to a packed house. Unfortunately, we couldn't snag one of those jazzy outdoor seats without a reservation, but no problem--we were quickly seated inside. 

FOOD: Hmm, B-OK? I don't know if I'd say A-OK. We started with the Panko Crusted Calamari & Caesar Salad. The calamari coating... I wouldn't call it panko. The pieces were tiny and took up maybe 1/4th of the plate, with 1/2 of the plate being covered by the container for sauce. There was possibly more sauce than calamari! Our salad came with two dainty white anchovies and was more filling than the squid. The complimentary foccacia was dry and oily... For the main courses, we ordered the Short Ribs & Scallops in Moscato Sauce. The ribs fell off the bone and I guess it went nicely with the garlic mashed potatoes, but the sauce came off too strong for me. The scallops were nicely seared, but I was underwhelmed by the homemade pasta and the sauce was way sweeter than I expected. Finally, we had to end our Italian dinner with tiramisu. Sadly, the little cake tower had fallen over by the time it reached our table, and while one layer was thoroughly soaked in coffee, another layer was horribly dry. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive, filling our water glasses throughout the evening. She reassured us that our choices were great... unfortunately we were kind of let down. Not her fault though.

ENVIRONMENT: While the tables inside were VERY cozy (a tad too close), it felt comfortable and cute. I'd definitely recommend trying to get outdoor seating on a nice day though! One thing that really caught me off gaurd was looking up at the painting on the wall about halfway through dinner, and realizing that it was an image of Florence's iconic Duomo and campanile. 

While I definitely wouldn't say the meal was horrible, it was far from spectacular. I'd come again if a friend was dying to go, but I probably wouldn't recommend this place on my own."
1192,"My girlfriends and I came here last year for Restaurant Week and decided to do a repeat because it was so good. We had an 8:00 reservation, but the previous party didn't vacate until 8:45 and the staff had no backup plan... we were frustrated until we were compensated with wine and caprese salad, which we did not order. We are easy to please. 

The ribolita (soup) was still flavorful and filling. The risotto would have been too heavy to order as my entree after the hearty soup, so I ordered the fish, which I couldn't enjoy while looking at my friends' scallop Alfredo (sweet and not too thick) and porcini mushroom and duck confit risotto. Get one of those and you'll be fine. 

You can't go wrong with ANY of the desserts."
1193,Food was great. Got plenty at a moderate price. Seating is a bit tight but worth it. We ate early but a reservation is highly suggested. We did not have one but were still seated right away on a Sat eve. Give extra time to find a place to park. We had the app special. Yellow tomatoes in a balsamic sauce with cheese. Also the onion tart with goat cheese. For main course wife had the EGGPLANT ROLLATINI over spaghetti. I had the ROAST CHICKEN PUTTANESCA it had black olives capers and a wide pasta. If we ever get back to Portland we will be back
1194,Meal was excellent! Mussels were out of this world. Marinara was light and flavorful.
1195,Great little restaurant nice quiet atmosphere I had the sauteed  gnocchi with pancetta in a lite tomato sauce with peas and fresh  mozzarella cheese this was a great pasta
1196,"Small Italian restaurant with a moderately sized menu and a value-priced wine list.  The crowd seemed ""older"" (60's and 70's), and the decor is certainly not modern.  The ceiling tiles need to be replaced, along with the old carpet.  The music playing was also very old fashioned (super annoying).  Focaccia with olive oil was a standard, if tasty, opening to the meal.  The special appetizer was stuffed figs wrapped with prosciutto, and it was mediocre, but why three?  There were two of us, so it should have been an even number.  Strange.  It was also apparent that they were not made recently, which is also a lazy way to cook.  Moreover, it took a very long time to come from the kitchen.  (Service here is very slow, despite an empty restaurant on a Thursday in season).  In addition, they should have served it first, instead of filing the table with that AND the salad AND the soup.  That's a novice waitress error.  They need to space it out better.  The tortellini en brodo also came with only three tortellini, and they were huge - normally, you have more and they are smaller.  This was more like Italian won ton soup.  And where was the Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on the soup?  It was also a bit watered down, and not as richly flavored as I would expect.  It was a bit drab.  As for the tomato and bread salad, it was more like they filled a cup with chopped tomato and bread crumbs and laid it on the plate.  Not your typical panzanella salad -- and not in a good way.  Use ""google"" (if you've heard of it) and look up ""panzanella salad.""

For main courses (which took an hour and a quarter to come out), my wife had the handmade pasta with pork confit.  While maybe a little better than the appetizers, the pork was dry and the whole dish under seasoned.  It didn't meld together; more like mom's sad leftovers made two days earlier.  The eggplant rollatini was a bit better (I'm being nice), but nothing I would come back for.  The tomato sauce surrounding it was the highlight; well made and rich in chunky tomatoes and herbs.  But the dish itself was a shadow of Italian cuisine.  Again, a lazy kitchen turning out sad plates.  We actually went across the street afterward to eat oysters, just to take the taste out of our mouths.  

As a positive, the wine list is very fairly priced and made up of good tasting wines.  Bravo for that.

Overall, however, this is an old, tired restaurant with a lazy feel to the whole experience.  Gordon Ramsey needs to come here and kick some a--.  Maybe once this was a decent place, but that time -- like big hair in the 80's -- has long since passed."
1197,This was a great find! It was warm and cozy perfect for date night.  We had the panzanella salad which was super tasty for an app. For dinner I had the white bean and sage ravioli which was so delicious and different from the usual selection at Italian restaurants. For dessert we had the tiramisu which also did not disappoint. Overall great service and food and an awesome experience!
1198,"Probably a candidate for the best meal of my life. This was back in April when I left Portland and I'm still thinking about next time I can go again. 

Ambience is super romantic great for a date night or just an intimate dinner to catch up with a friend or family member. The service was helpful and knowledgeable about the dishes and helped me decide on a plate (because everything sounded so good!)

I had scallop and prosecco cream with fettuccini and my boyfriend had the pan seared gnocchi with prosciutto and peas. Both amazing dishes. I didn't want the meal to end!! We had a bottle of wine with our meal and ended it with desert for each of us since we couldn't decide on one! I don't think you could go wrong! 

Prices were really fair for the quality of food and all the things we enjoyed! 

Overall, you need to come here, it will change your life ;-)"
1199,"So I just moved to Maine and have been trying out all the restaurants in the area. I figured I'd review this one first as it's my favorite place so far.

It's located next to the famous Duck Fat restaurant and it's easy to spot as it's the restaurant that doesn't have people waiting outside. Don't let that fool you though as this place is better in my opinion.

The place has a nice interior that feels cozy and is a nice place to have a quiet conversation. The service could be better, but I certainly wouldn't dock any points for them as the food more than makes up for it.

One of my favorite dishes here is the fresh pasta with scallops and moscato cream. In the words of my uncle, ""you can taste how unhealthy it is"", which means there's a lot of delicious fats in it. Their appetizers are great too, the antipasta platter is very pretty. I wish I took a picture, but I was too busy enjoying it.

I will definitely be back here again!"
1200,"I went to Ribollita for my husband's birthday last Friday. I would definitely go to this restaurant again. Our table started off with some goat cheese stuffed squash blossoms - they were basically exploding with cheese. The Ribollita soup was DELICIOUS and I think the ravioli (white bean and romano with balsamic brown butter) was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Unfortunately, the risotto of the day was just a tad disappointing. It was tasty, but they added too much broth so it was a little soupy in my opinion."
1201,"We enjoyed a birthday celebration dinner for my mother over the weekend, a party of 11, seated in the large round table in the corner. While it is a cozy restaurant, I didn't feel crowded.

We shared some appetizers, the calamari, the muscles, and Prosciutto wrapped melon. All of them were great, with the melon standing out, for it's freshness and vibrancy, and the exceptional melt in your mouth prosciutto. I chose the linguini and scallops in marinara, which was lovely.  The tangy marinara complimented the buttery soft sea scallops, and the dish arrived piping hot without the scallops overcooking. Kudos to the team on that! In fact, every dish arrived with steam rising from the plates. 

Service was exceptional as well. This was my first visit, though my parents have gone for many years. I will definitely be back."
1202,This was an amazing Italian dinner. Thoroughly loved my entire meal. Just visiting Portland Maine and found this jewel. Parking was difficult but got that done and ate at 5:30 which worked out cause reservations are suggested and didn't have one. But I recommend that even though I didn't have trouble being on a Saturday evening...a table outside and weather was perfect.
1203,Great food.  Not a lot of seating.  We arrived at 5:30 and things filled up quickly.  Took a while for entrees to arrive but we were with good company.   Took 2 hours for dinner.   When we left there was a line waiting for their reservations.  Not sure if the kitchen is always slow or just got hit on a busy night.   All the food was excellent so we would return.
1204,We love this place . We are heading up to Portland this weekend and the first thing we did was to call and put in our reservation! Can't wait!
1205,Scallops with almond cream sauce is an absolute must try!!!! Good price. The fried calamari was ok.
1206,"What a wonderful experience my friend and I had at this spot! We're younger and it's a little ritzy so that can always be a hit or miss, but the staff were all so friendly! Our server, Bob, was such a kind and patient guy! He could describe every item we asked about on the menu in detail. Our glasses were always full and table was always well manicured so it didn't ever feel overcrowded between courses. We began with the calamari, and it was a perfect portion for sharing to start. I had the North End pasta dish, and it was hands down the best pasta I've ever had. It paired really nicely with a glass of prosecco. The desserts all looked really tempting but just couldn't fit it in. Definitely will be recommending this place time and time again! Thank you Bob for a wonderful dining experience!"
1207,"Ate here last Friday and the place was jamming. Ribollita is a small and intimate restaurant on the top of Middle St.  The place is cute with about a dozen tables inside and 3 tables out on the sidewalk.  We had a reservation at 7:15 but had to wait about 15 minutes before our table was ready.  I may be wrong but it looked and felt like they were short on wait staff.  While our server was very nice, she looked incredibly stressed.  For an example, my wife and mom ordered a second round of drinks.  It took about 15 minutes for my wife's beer to come out and asked my mom again if she wanted another glass of wine. If our waitress wasn't so stressed out and a bit forgetful, I would have given Ribollita a 5 star rating because the food was delicious!

For an app, I had the mussels in pistachio butter and herbs and it was just great.  The serving size was pretty large.  Two people could have easily split the dish.  I had no issues finishing it myself though.  I just love mussels.  My mother and wife had a green salad and a Caesar respectively which they enjoyed. Again, the serving sizes were decent.  For an entree, my wife had the special which was risotto with fresh corn, foraged mushrooms in a wonderful broth.  The portion size for a nice place like this one was HUGE! She loved it and I did as well.  My mom had the cannelloni which came out piping hot and I had my go to dish here; the pan-seared gnocchi with fresh peas and prosciutto which came out hot too. Sorry, but one of my pet peeves is when my food comes out lukewarm or cold. It is indicative of a lack of flow, communication and organization between the kitchen and the wait staff.  Not here!  They had that together, no problem. I digress.... My gnocchi was wonderful.  The bottoms of the gnocchi were seared but also al dente which had just a wonderful texture.  The flavors were wonderful.  The peas added a wonderful freshness to the dish. I loved it.

We considered dessert but just couldn't eat another bite.  We ended up taking home some leftovers. I highly recommend Ribollita.  The space is quaint and the food delicious.  What a true gem in the Old Port. While I wouldn't consider this place formal or dressy, I feel it demands the respect of wearing a nice shirt and shoes instead of a tee shirt with shorts or a tank top."
1208,"I had a job interview dinner here in August and the service and food were really good. I had the Pan-Seared Gnocchi which was tasty and I enjoyed.

But my dinner companion had the White Bean & Romano Ravioli with
Balsamic Brown Butter.
I immediately hated my dinner and lusted after hers as it was the best ravioli I have even tried.  I wanted to rip it from her plate into my mouth.

Is it a deadly sin to lust after another's dinner?"
1209,"Not good. Server wasn't knowledgeable of the wines. Calamari was tough, even for calamari. The seating was pretty tight in the restaurant (which is fine) but my chair was bumped numerous time by the service and only said ""excuse me"" once.

Worst part was the entree. The gnocchi was terrible. Zero flavor - totally dry. This dish really needs a sauce.

I wish I could be even more specific on this review but I don't want to waste any more time on somewhere that I really didn't care for."
1210,"I so wanted to enjoy this place - I love Italian food and I was really hungry going here - but it just didn't do it for me. There were unusually long wait times for the server to come check in on us; the olive oil and bread were stale and tasted off; and the pasta (that was purportedly homemade) with pork confit was very meh and consisted mostly of white beans with some startlingly flat, wide noodles. Overall a disappointing experience."
1211,"One of those rare bad food experiences in Portland. The place was sweltering and airless until we asked that the air be turned on. Neither the waitress nor the server who dropped our food wordlessly at our table took the time to ask us if we needed anything, or later whether we had enjoyed our meal. So I felt compelled to tell our server that we had not. 

Her response?

""Really??!! I've never heard that before"", she said, batting her eyes. 

I found that hard to believe. I worked as a waiter for many years, and have a lot of empathy for waiters/waitresses and for everyone in the business. By the end of my experience I was likely the waiter from hell. But I also realized very quickly that the old adage that ""you get what you give"" really does apply. There is no reason to get haughty with a customer who is simply telling you that the food you brought to the table sucks.   

And of course no matter how good or bad  the service, no server can overcome the fact that their restaurant is serving bad food.

The calamari was cowering inside a rough cornmeal exterior which elicited the gag reflex. It came with a sailors size dollop of godawful mayonnaise colored with something pink. It was as tasty as it sounds. Their famous bread soup may have had its fifteen minutes of fame twenty years ago, but has ended up on Skid Row;  my scallop pasta dish was swimming in a sauce so thin it was virtually invisible, and my wife's ravioli was drowning in a cup or so of brown butter so insipid she couldn't finish the dish.

We passed on dessert. They didn't seem to care. Nor do we. Duck Fat is thankfully right next door, Fore Street is a hop and skip away, and for very good very simply prepared Italian and great service, Paciarino is just around the corner. 

""Why go out for hamburger when you can have steak at home??"""
1212,"This night was special!  We are celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary with a first ever trip to Maine.  We chose Ribollita for our celebration.  It didn't disappoint.  We loved the atmosphere, small and quaint.  The server was kind and explained the menu.  Our food was wonderful!  We made unforgettable memories in Maine, and Ribollita was one of them!"
1213,"I've been to Ribollita several times and have yet to be displeased. It is a small place and they get filled up pretty quickly, though thankfully they take reservations. It is best for a smaller group (6 or fewer). It is cozy and well laid-out, so that despite being small, you don't feel like you're right on top of every other diner. 

I love the caprese salad, the salmon special over mashed potatoes was divine, and I've also had pan-seared gnocchi - amazing texture and flavor. They were flexible with my requests to make an entree vegetarian friendly (pescatarian to be specific), which was much appreciated. Nice wine selection, reasonably priced, great service - this is a winner."
1214,"Had a birthday dinner for my significant other at ribolita tonight. It was just the two of us. I had called for reservations this afternoon and asked if we could request one of the less crowded tables. I know is there really such a thing at ribolita. Well having been here before, I basically didn't want the two top as you walk in the door and I didn't want the table that abuts the 4 top so close that you can't pull your chair in because you are on top of the other table. We did get seated at the later. I basically sat in the isle and as anyone that has been here knows there is no extra room in the isle.  

We have both eaten here many many times before but it has been probably 6 months since our last visit basically due to the very very poor service and food that has lost its authenticity and flavor from what it used to be.  This evening, a Thursday night mind you, with a party already seated of at least 8, had only one waitress on duty with the support help from the hostess for the entire restaurant. When we were seated all the tables were full except for 1. So I think this one waitress had 11 tables and one of those was the party if 8+. 

I do not think the waitress would be as poor as she was for the circumstances. I will call the restaurant and ask for the owner/manager tomorrow to speak about the service.

The food itself was flavorless. We had a salad to start with that was ok just because the balsamic vinegar used on it was nice but the mozzarella was probably from SAMs club and was the least expensive variety as there was absolutely no flavor. This was after the rosemary focaccia that was dry and stale. We had the fettucine and scallops and the chicken puttanesca. The scallops were ok, a couple of small shells were on them and they must not be using cream/cheese for the sauce, it was like warm milk at best and very very very salty.  The chicken dish was served with dark meat and I think there was maybe five small pieces. If it wasn't for all the capers in the dish there would not have been any flavor. 

I have to say as this used to be one of our go to restaurants for many years and we would recommend it to all our friends that has come to an end, sorry to see it go as my other favorite Italian restaurant, Bresca has shut down. Portland is missing a true Italian restaurant."
1215,"Very friendly service, which would make this more of a 3.5 stars. However, our food was just okay, and not memorable. We did the antipasto appetizer plate, the cannelloni (a slight spicy flavor to the sauce), and another handmade pasta dish. Tiny restaurant with tables placed quite close together. Tiny bathroom. Not a rush to go back."
1216,"I continue to be infatuated with Ribollita. Not only did my husband and I go here on one of our first dates, but we stopped by before our wedding to have a moment together, and have gone for Valentine's Day/Anniversaries ever since.

I am never disappointed with Ribollita and I know the more people find out about it, the less it becomes our ""little italian restaurant"" That's okay. If their success means I have to plan a little better to get a reservation (i.e. more than 3 hours in advance, duhhhh), I'm okay with it.

This time I had the tortolini en brodo (one of my faves, delicious warm soup with the perfect broth) and the market risotto (gorgonzola, radicchio - simply divine).

And I ate it for THREE MEALS afterwards. Yes, it was that big.

Two people - 
2 glasses of wine
2 soups
2 entrees
2 coffees

$59.00. Plus tip. You've got to be joking right? It's the best meal in town dollar for dollar."
1217,"I went here for the first time last year and it instantly became my favorite restaurant! I lived in Italy for 4 months and the meals that I have tried here rival the ones I had abroad. The pan seared gnocchi is beyond delicious! My boyfriend loves their ravioli. Get the house red wine, you won't be disappointed! 

Quiet location and only a handful of tables - great atmosphere. We went on a first date here - and recent anniversary- and it was the perfect location. The prices are good and you get free bread too :)"
1218,"Have to say extremely disappointed. Your restaurant was recommended by our son who has eaten there multiple time suggested while we were in Portland for our 30th anniversary to have our special anniversary nite dinner there. Could not have been worse.

We call two weeks prior to make a reservation. Showed up just prior to our reservation and were not seated till 40 min later.  Ordered our meal simple pasta dishes that's were on the menu over an hour we still had not received our meal.. Told the waitress we were leaving she offered to box them up for us to go.

While the wait staff ( 3 different servers were very apologetic as we left ) not once did the manager, owner, or chef address us. 

Disappointing is not the right word  it was very sad on a special nite!!!! We also let the concierge at our hotel the Portland Harbor Hotel know what happen as well as he said its one of the best restaurants in Portland."
1219,"Another wonderful meal at one of the best restaurants we have been to. The soup the restaurant is named for is such a treat. Tasty Tuscan comfort food. The white bean ravioli melts in your mouth and has such a rich flavor. Our waitperson was prompt, cheerful, knowledgeable and gracious. It is cozy and comfortable. This is at least our fifth wedding anniversary celebrated here and we hope for many more."
1220,"The food is delicious !  Service  is attentive.  The decor is cozy.  We went on a Monday night, early, and the place was full when we left. Make reservations.

We had an extraordinary sausage stuffed portobello, delicious short rib ragu, Caesar salad all top notch.  Their house red wine in a 'rooster' is good.  Desserts of maple cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake were yummy.

Highly recommend !"
1221,"Can't believe this place was so
Slow!!! The waitress was really nice but the food was not great. We didn't get a drink order for over 20 Min. And the food was ok"
1222,Quaint place.  Be prepared to wait as kitchen is small.  Dishes are all freshly prepared.  Service was ok.  Not bad.  Not great.  We had Caesar to start.   Not very garlicky or lemon tasting.  Dinner was cannelloni which was missing cheese and ravioli in brown butter sauce... Better.  No cannoli which I thought was bizzare.  Atmosphere was wonderful.  Prices pretty reasonable.
1223,"This is a great little gem nestled right next to Duckfat. Great atmosphere, great staff and delicious, fresh homemade Italian food. The mushroom risotto was delicious, the carbonara was divine! A great place all around!"
1224,"During my recent trip to Portland, ME, this place caught my eye because of the rustic Italian menu. Case in point: most Italian restaurants don't even *serve* ribollita, nevermind name themselves after it. 

The start was admittedly not auspicious. We were greeted with perhaps my #1 restaurant pet peeve situation -- a reserved table that you have to wait around for. The friendly hostess did, however, update us several times on its status and offered to us menus and wine while we waited. Once we sat down, our server took a bit longer to take our orders than I would have expected, given that we'd already been looking at the menus for 15-20 minutes before we sat down. It was a busy Saturday night, and I'm sure they had their hands full, but it was a full 30 minutes from my reservation time to when someone asked to take our order. A hungry visiter is sometimes a cranky one!

But all was forgiven when the food started arriving. Oh, the food. 

From the small vegetable plates to the pasta to the fantastic zabaglione, the food was exactly what I had hoped it would be -- thoughtfully prepared but not fussy, generous portions, excellent-quality ingredients. Even the olive oil served with the bread was remarkably flavorful. These folks clearly care about the ingredients they're using, and it really elevated everything we ate from ""good Italian food"" to ""great Italian food"" status. Some stand-out dishes that we ordered: the roast chicken puttanesca, the ribollita, and the sausage and rapini side.

And thanks to the fellow Yelpers who warned that the generous dinner portions could leave you too full to partake in their fabulous desserts. I asked to have the last portion of my puttanesca wrapped up to allow a bit of room for the zabaglione -- a very light marsala wine custard, here served with fresh blueberries and peaches. It was a perfect capper to a really exquisite meal. Added bonus: super yummy leftovers for dinner tonight!

So despite the shaky start, the exceptional food and warm atmosphere more than made up for it. I would absolutely go back."
1225,"Saturday night, height of tourist season, we were lucky to get a table anywhere. The restaurant was ready full, but the hostess went out of her way to accommodate us at a front table with stools: probably a waiting area any other night. The waitress expressed surprise at this. At first I thought this seemed a little rude, but after waiting a looong time, I understood her shock. Totally Slammed, the kitchen scrambled to meet the demand, in spite of a fast hustling wait staff. (Who did check in and apologized later for the wait).

Not at all bad, the big portions of food left us feeling heavy. Very rich beef ragu and very buttery white fish tasted fine. Sadly, the chaos dominated the experience and left an aftertaste of stress.

I'm a visitor, not a local. For hearty Italian food with authentic style, I'd try it again in the off season."
1226,"My friend and I got there about 6:00, and were lucky to get an early table without a reservation. It filled up very fast.
We both got the Tuscan fish stew. Delicious! Curiously, not served with any bread, but I hope I get to go there again soon."
1227,"What great, great, great ambience. So relaxed, cozy all the other adjectives thrown out from past reviews are exactly right. It is a small place, open kitchen and a place that I really enjoyed. 

Started with 3 apps, only one was a disappointment. The calamari severely lacked flavor. I checked after we left, it was because the waitress/back of the house forgot the aioli that came with the dish! So, It just tasted like nothing, but the salted codcakes were crispy on the outside, but delicate and tasty on the inside. We really enjoyd them. The sauce drizzled atop I don't think did much overall. The ribollita soup was delicious. It was hearty, and well rounded in flavor. Sweet, creamy because of the bread and cheese... so delicious.


Entrees, they were all overall tasty. The North end white sauce with clams I think was the table favorite. Sweet, fresh and light and extremely satisfying. Scallops in a moscato cream sauce was also great. Perfectly cooked tender scallops, perfect amount of sauce. The only thing is that particular serving was considerably smaller than the  3 other dishes on the table. Chicken puttanesca I found to be very bright, fresh and a good tartness with the capers and olives. The chicken was tender, and the pappardelle was maybe a touch over cooked, but hardly noticeable. The market risotto with spinach, chanterelles and duck confit was good, but not great. It actually really needed just a touch of salt. But besides that, it was creamy, good amounts of tender spinach, perfectly good mushrooms and fall off the bone duck, with great crispy skin!

No space for dessert sadly. =(

Service was on point. All the staff, all females this evening were all friendly. We came in, no reservations and they made it work. Water glasses were always refilled. The only thing is we were late to be offered second glasses of wine and sodas. But besides that, overall great experience."
1228,"What a wonderful find on a snowy night last night. Loved the cozy brick interior and white linens. Service was exceptional - everything you needed / wanted in a very calm professional way. Lovely wine selection. Started with the onion tart (so worth the wait because it's made to order)  the caramelized onion,  olive & goat cheese toppings melted in your mouth.  I had the roasted chicken puttanesca, and my husband had the saltimbocca. Both awesome. Lovely dining experience. We'll be back!"
1229,"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant tonight for dinner and we loved it. You walk through the entrance and you immediately feel like you are stepping to an Italian's dinning room in their house. They have 2 rooms with seating and the kitchen in another room and you can see straight into the kitchen.

We ordered the antipasti plate, which was fantastic value for $9.95! Then I ordered the ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the beef with polenta. Both absolutely amazing in taste and the portions were huge (esp the beef). We were stuffed after eating that and couldn't fit dessert in (disappointingly as we kept seeing them come out for other tables and were excited to try them!).

All the food was fantastic value for money and really was great Italian food. I would love to see them reduce the portion size of the mains so that people could fit dessert in. They would earn more money, instead of having people ask them to package up their leftovers mains to take home and not having dessert!

The waitresses were very prompt and friendly. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was nice and peaceful and service of the food came out at a reasonable pace.

We had a great experience here and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to friends who visit Maine."
1230,"Relaxed atmosphere, intimate, maybe 15 tables...nice take on Caprice w/fontina instead of mozzarella. The chicken  puttanesca was Very good! chicken was white meat off the bone & tender, hard to do. Overall taste was not overwhelming, the Pasta was fresh & the Marinara very good, not burnt. Service nice, maybe a little slow for my taste but I'm from Boston. Portions were just right."
1231,"Very seldom do I dish out the five stars but considering the location, service and the food, I have got to give credit where credit is due.

Started off with two glasses of the seasonal sangria, peach! Crisp and fruity. Summer perfection.

I got the White Bean and Romano Ravioli. It comes with this balsamic brown butter deliciousness drizzled all over it and I nearly finished the whole thing! The ravioli here is among one of the handmade pasta dishes and you can 100% tell.

My cousin (who had just returned from studying abroad for the semester in Italy) enjoyed the savory Ribollita soup, their take on the Tuscan vegetable and bread soup. 

An all around fantastic experience for a local restaurant tucked away by the seaside in Maine! Servers were knowledgeable, attentive, accommodating and friendly."
1232,"So happy we decided to eat here - the food was so good!!  And we had a beautifully warm night to enjoy the outdoor seating.

~ 1 glass of port (served in the cutest glass ever)
~ a couple of side dishes as starters (contorni - i learned a new word!)
      *arugula w/shaved romano cheese, lemon & olive oil - simple & flavorful
      *faro (make that two new words!) w/pesto - great texture & very tasty
~ oven-poached pollock w/cheese tortellini - the fish was very good & the broth was unexpectedly comforting
~ white bean & romano ravioli w/balsamic brown butter - yum
~ tiramisu w/a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side - the ABSOLUTE BEST tiramisu we have ever tasted and the vanilla ice cream was amazing as well (we were told the chef makes his own ice cream so we couldn't resist!)

All of the staff treated us well & we particularly enjoyed our server, Beth - very friendly & real & knowledgeable about the menu.

Don't know when we'll be back in Portland, ME but I definitely want to go back to Ribollita when we do!!

NOTE: We were lucky to be seated fairly quickly (within 10-15 minutes of arrival) at a table for two without reservations on a Saturday night but if you have a larger party or have a preference about whether you sit indoors or outdoors, you'll probably want to make a reservation."
1233,"Great hidden little Gem.Found this place online while staying in portland so glad we did.Got there right when they opened,seated right away .staff was great helped my wife chose a wine and gave us the specials.we started with caprese salad which was so good..fried calamari was fresh & so good.main courses were on point..eggplant rollitini (Awesome) & scallops with prosecco cream & fettucine (Awesome) no room for dessert.will return on our next trip to portland"
1234,"We stopped at Ribollita on a Thursday night in December while traveling through Portland. We arrived after shortly after nine o'clock and we could tell that the waiter was a little ticked off by this. Our waiter was an older gentleman, he was impersonal and most likely upset that we were going to be there late. We put in our orders immediately to speed things up. He smoothed things over and warmed up to us towards the end of our meal. 

Making up for that experience was the food. It was excellent. The presentation and quality were spot on. Everyone I was with said that their entrees were delicious. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves at Ribollita and we hope to be back soon."
1235,"I can't believe this place is able to stay open. The service was terrible and the food was bland. A complete waste of $109 that i spent attempting to celebrate my sister's 30th birthday. DO NOT GO HERE. You know it's bad when you're eating scallops, trying to imagine them tasting of something other than the sauce that they're in. Yuck."
1236,"Absolutely wonderful!  Outstanding experience from beginning to end.  Restaurant was clean and cozy.  Server made us feel right at home.  Wife and I split a heart of romaine salad with Gorgonzola, pancetta, and walnuts.  Flavors were clean and delightful.  I then ordered the chicken a la puttanesca and my wife the special of pork medallions in a piccata sauce with garlic mashed potatoes and a mushrooms with zucchini.  Both were fantastic.  Rustic, hearty, fresh--just delicious.  Server recommended the perfect glass of red wine to accompany the dishes.  Finished with the tiramisu--perfect.  

We both agreed it was the best meal we'd had all year.  If you've had your fill of lobster and want some of the best Italian around don't miss Ribollita!"
1237,"My wife and I happened to walk by and were checking out the menu posted in the window.  It looked fantastic! Luckily there were tables available as it was fairly early.
The staff was courteous and inviting. 
We had the mussels with pistachio butter, calamari and a special heirloom tomato salad with fontina. ALL of them hit the mark!
For entrees we had the radicchio wrapped salmon and the white bean ravioli. BOTH were cooked to perfection! For dessert the flourless chocolate torte which was divine!
A sign of a great restaurant for me, besides the quality of the food,  is when you get the check and you don't get sticker shock! I actually expected the bill to be MUCH higher for the level of service and the quality of the food. 
We'll definitely be back to try the shortribs!
Yes, the ambiance could be better but who cares when you have a fantastic meal!
A great little gem in Portland!"
1238,"At first, the restaurant looked promising. The wait was decent. The hostess was inviting. And then we met our server. Little did we know we would encounter an incompetent human being. The service was terrible. We asked her for her personal favorite dish and she chose the most expensive thing on the menu and failed to explain it coherently, clearly trying to upsell the dish. The owner greeted every surrounding table but ignored our party. Adding chicken to my pasta cost me $3.50 but it was undercooked and made me sick... She never acknowledged how our food took over 45 minutes to prepare. She never asked how our food was after being served or filled our water. I would never, ever recommend this place to anyone."
1239,"The Caesar salad and Zucchini flower stuffed with goat cheese were quite good along with Flan their signature dessert. The spinach with pine nuts and golden raisins was good but a bit salty. The fresh pasta pomodoro was also good but swimming is sauce.

Our waitress Laura was great and there was a great selection of well priced Italian wines. 

The main courses we had caciucco and hake with saffron broth and fennel both were lacking in flavor. They were both missing the use of herbs and flavorful stocks to form the foundation for making a great dish. Tossing fresh basil on a dish tastes great but does nothing towards building depth of flavor."
1240,"We ate here while waiting for friends to return from a show. We had salad that had blood orange, fennel, pomegranate seed and shaved parmesean cheese  that was crisp, light and delightful. My husband and I swapped so he ate the Tuscan vegatable soup. It was way over stewed for me- almost but not quite pureed texture but he liked it. Next was fish stew-smokey, red wine -subtlety-almost- beefy-tomato broth and husband had angelhair pasta with shrimp nicoise sauce- tart with salty vinegar with a hint of pickled cherry pepper/caper taste. We waited till 645pm (arrived at 5) for our second course and it was worth it. Its as good as it gets this side of the pond. Next were cappuccinos and a very tart not too sweet fluffy  maple marscapone cheesecake with a walnut crust. Syrup was almost basalmic but not quite. Different in a good way. Service was great but by the windows were cold. All the charm of a small European family run restaurant and resonably priced. A great date place."
1241,"My favorite Italian restaurant in Portland.  If you happen to peek in the window early afternoon you will see that day's handmade pasta drying on racks.  

I've had everything on the menu but I always come back to one... the gnocchi.  They pan fry them right before they serve them. Imagine nice pillowy gnocchi with crispy outsides... yum"
1242,"Ran in here a couple weekends ago... tried the Caprese Salad and the much raved about sauteed gnocchi. Salad was average and the gnochi was above average, but didn't resonate with me the same way it did with other reviewers. It's original (at least for me), but doesn't burn into my memory the same way other memorable gnocchis have like: Firenze in SF, Spinasse in SEA or even Brewar's Art in Balt.

The prices were incredibly reasonable, but the service combined with the ok to ok+ food, made this an average visit and not a restaurant on my shortlist to return to or recomned"
1243,"Great little place.  Cozy and comfortable, and the food was lovely.  I really didn't want a whole plate of pasta or a bunch of chicken, so I came here because they offered a tempting variety of a couple of small plates.  Also, I promise not to rant again about American portion control (or lack thereof!).

I started off with the Ribollita soup.  Very tasty, served nice and hot.  I also ordered a dish of Farro with Pesto and Broccolini with Sausages and garlic.  the Farro was Farro, in my mind it's not all that interesting, and the pesto was fine.  Presented nicely, it was nothing to really write home about.  The Broccolini was very tasty, sauteed in garlic and possibly the renderings of the sliced sausages.  Simple, delicious, and good.

Although I shouldn't have done it, I ordered their vanilla bean flan which was also very good.  And then I waddled home."
1244,"I will try to be as subjective with this review as possible.  We were seated next to some other patrons who soured our dining experience, but I understand this cannot be attributed to Ribollita.

We showed up without reservations, but we were squeezed in between reservations nonetheless.  We definitely noticed we were being rushed throughout dinner which was understandable, but not very appreciated.  My butternut squash ravioli with sage butter was delicious.  My friend enjoyed her mista salad, but found her linguini undercooked (possibly due to being rushed).  The service wasn't terrible, but our waitress was not personable or knowledgable about the menu.  While I appreciate intimate restaurants, Ribollita is a little too intimate.  The tables are very tight and we were seated at most three feet from our fellow diners.  This arrangement led to the awkward experience I stated above.

I think that Ribollita is a good restaurant, but I do not feel we saw its best side.  From our waiter, to our neighbors, to being rushed, Ribollita was a very underwhelming experience for us."
1245,"Just a day and night in Portland, so we wanted the right restaurant for dinner, and we chose well! We arrived ten minutes early for our reservation and were promptly seated. The place is small and intimate. It was also very busy. The tables around us all seemed happy and engaged.  Good sign. 

Our server, Beth, was professional and good humored. For starters we had the caprese and a special 4 bean salad. Both were excellent. A litre of the house red was perfect accompaniment to our meal. They we're out of the chicken jugs, so a plain ole carafe did the trick!

Hubby had the North End linguine with mussels, loads of mussels. He loved it!  I had fettuccine and scallops with muscato cream. It was devine!  We shared a tiramisu, and hubby had an espresso. 

Good thing we walked ... So full and happy.

A delightful evening!"
1246,"My wife and i tried out Ribollita for a date night.  it is a very small, intimate place with a great atmosphere.  The service is very friendly and quick.

We each had a salad, mine a Caesar and her a caprese.   They were both excellent.

For the entrees she had eggplant and i had the short ribs.  With were fantastic.   The beef melted off the bone.

The price was very reasonable, very much recommend."
1247,"I will start out and acknowledge that my 2 star rating was earned entirely by our very poor server.  The food was for the most part very good with the exception of the bread that was brought to the table.  It was pretty lack luster and a touch stale.  Our waiter on the other hand seemed entirely out of his element running around on a Friday night with his head spinning.  i get that things can get hectic in a restaurant on a weekend night, but this guy seemed like it was his first day.  He disappeared for long periods of time, forgot things he said he would bring and over promised on several occasions.  

I will say that the lasagna special I had was very tasty and worthy of 3+stars, but I couldn't get over the service."
1248,"Date night!  Cozy little spot with great food and wine.  Prices are reasonable, unlike quite a few other restaurants in Portland.  I highly recommend this place."
1249,"Ribollita. Bonita ribollita. I eat a ribollita
...that's all i can think of.

There's something great about really small, intimate restaurants that are too small to be intimate. You know what I mean? You can try to chat only to your date, but you're likely to overhear or even engage your neighbors in conversation.  

And if you chat up your neighbors enough, there's a 60% chance they'll give you some of their appetizer.  Yep, it's a little known secret guarded closely by The Charming and The Hungry. In this case, I was Charming and my esteemed bf was Hungry.

So we were having a romantic lil date, consisting of a full carafe of wine, Italian wedding pasta, mussels, and some other delish dish. Because the restaurant is so tiny, we ended up chatting with our other corner dwellers late into the night, swapping stories and food.

The meal was amazing not just because of the quality of the food, nor the competent but unobtrusive service, but also because it managed to capture something most modern food consumption lacks: the communal aspects of breaking bread together."
1250,"Wow. We were highly disappointed with this place, especially with so many good reviews given to it. Coming in with no reservation on a Friday night we were very happy to actually get a table in no time. The hostess was very nice, but after this everything went downhill.  The waiter was efficient but not very personable.  We then ordered two different pasta courses which were extremely under cooked. They had ways to go before reaching anywhere near al dente. Definitely not what you want for pasta. Lastly, what little flavor was found in our dishes was very unappealing. We ordered the check two bites into our meals and left in search of a second dinner."
1251,"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place upon arriving in Portland after a four-hour drive from Connecticut. We were walking across the street to another restaurant, smelled the aroma wafting from Ribolitta, and bee-lined for it immediately...and I'm so glad we did! Not only was it intimate and perfect for our anniversary date, the wine list was excellent (I had the Sut sauvignon blanc), and the service was professional and friendly. The real star of the evening was the food, though. I had the roast chicken puttanesca, which was fabulous, but boyfriend enjoyed a daily special of swordfish with a lemon caper sauce that was to-die-for. In fact, I kept stealing bites from his plate despite my own meal being very tasty and large. We stayed (a bit late, which the staff accommodated politely) for coffee and flourless chocolate cake, which were also divine. We both agreed this was in our top ten meals of all time. Thank you, Ribolitta!"
1252,"So I dragged my poor husband on foot all over town looking for a restaurant in a new city but with this one in mind. I really wanted linguine and clams and I read someone else's recommendation here on Yelp. When we finally got there, they set a table for us as we had no reservations on a Saturday night. It was full in the restaurant so I was surprised by the prime spot - right in front of the bay window in the side room. The floor is slanted slightly there which was probably why it wasn't occupied but we didn't mind, it was lovely. We shared the prosciutto and cantaloupe which was very tasty. I got my beloved linguine with not only clams, but scallops, calamari and mussels; they let you determine what goes in. I was very happy with the dish. But my husband who orders gnocchi from every menu anywhere said that Ribollita's was ""the best ever"". Pan-seared with prosciutto ... I tried it and it was divine!!! We shared a slice of cheesecake and it was light and airy but the pomegranate reduction from Micucci's rocked! Hugh was our server and he was so friendly and mellow. What a great evening! Go there, but make a reservation as they were full and don't seem to turn their tables (yours was yours for as long as you like)."
1253,"What a great little restaurant!

We had a 7:00 reservation, but got sick of walking around in sub-zero temps and showed up 30 minutes early. They had a table available and happily seated us.

The atmosphere in this place is so cozy and welcoming. It really does feel like you're dining in someone's home. The tables are close together, but positioned so they're not too close for comfort and you can still have a private conversation. We sat at a little table for two next to the open kitchen.

The menu here is a great mix of meat, seafood, and pasta - definitely something for everyone. We started out with the mussels, which were definitely the stand-out dish of the night. The broth was so yummy and garlicky. I could have just eaten some more those with some more of the rosemary bread for dipping and I would've been happy.

Husband had the braised short rib with mashed potatoes for his entree. I also happen to love braised short ribs, so I may have had a bite...or 3...the meat was sooo tender and the sauce was delicious! Our one complaint was that there was just a bit too much sauce on the plate, which kind of overwhelmed everything and drowned the mashed potatoes.  I had the scallops with fettucine and cream sauce. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious without being too heavy.

We also shared a rooster pitcher of house red wine, which was a great value at $20.

We were completely stuffed, but managed to leave a teensy bit of room for a few bites of tiramisu - yum!

In addition to being delicious, this restaurant is very well priced. Our appetizer, entrees, dessert, and wine, plus tax & tip came to about $90. We'll definitely be back next time we're in Portland!"
1254,"1. Chowder is great. I don't know how to cook chowder. I only know how to eat chowder.
2. Lobsters. How much? How big? Again don't care... it was delicious. 
3. Bring baby wipes. I didn't realise how I eat like cookie monster... leaving crumbs and a mess.. I shall now call myself lobster mobster."
1255,"For a restaurant being in a prime location in Old Port, don't expect all the bells and whistles! They serve their food in disposable plates & utensils, and the tables always feel slightly sticky. This little hole in the wall is not Insta-worthy, but if you are looking for a sample of the taste of Maine, you can try Gilbert's. I wouldn't say Gilbert's is the best chowder or seafood that I've had. In fact, I was disappointed by the chowder. It was nothing spectacular."
1256,Very disappointed with their food quality.  Clam chowder barely has any clams in there (a small cup of clam chowder was full of potato).  Clam cake bites 3 little tiny pieces of clam and the rest are breading
1257,"One of the few places with their own free parking spots if you get to Gilbert's early.  I was immediately greeted, served an ice cold beer.  8 different chowder options.  I was really impressed with the amount of lobster / seafood in the fresh bread bowl.  Easy to recommend this place."
1258,"Perfectly acceptable chowder. Not my favorite but certainly not bad. On a rainy day, it's a no frills, easy and quick soup experience. 

The clam chowder is THICK. I found the bread bowl to be light and airy, when I really wanted a sourdough heavy chowder-worthy style bowl. I recommend skipping the bread bowl and just getting a cup with oyster crackers. 

My dining companion got the super seafood chowder. It is overflowing with seafood (see photo).  

Would I go there again? Yep, especially for a to-go cup of chowder on a cold day."
1259,"Gilbert's came recommended by a local and their recommendation was spot on.

It was a cold rainy night and a nice warm bowl of soup sounded amazing.

We started with the whole belly clam appetizer which was cooked to golden brown perfection. These were simply delicious.

We both got the New England Clam Chowder in a bread bowl and everything about it was perfect. Flavorful chowder, fresh bread, and more than enough to fill you up.

The service was spot on and the entire staff was very friendly. Overall, great experience at Gilbert's."
1260,"We read about Gilbert's in a ""Visiting Portland"" article and thought we had to make a stop in. It's in a very convenient location right on the water. The establishment is very divey, you walk in and seems pretty outdated. Service is okay, the waitress seemed to make patrons less of a priority than other things going on, but it was still a pretty quick meal. You can see a little bit of the kitchen, and it definitely has a diner feel. The food was fairly priced and they had lots of great specials to choose from. Food was great, but nothing special. Overall, our experience was okay. For a quick bowl of chowder on a cool day, it would be a good quick stop."
1261,"After spending several hours walking around Peaks Island, we embarked from the Casco Bay ferry, very hungry, on October 14. For some reason, we didn't use Yelp this time. Shortly after  rounding the corner from the ferry we noticed Gilbert's Chowder House. We really liked the name, probably because we were craving chowder. I ordered the whole belly clam dinner accompanied by fries with a cup of thick, creamy and clammy chowder = amazing  Hubby ordered the lobster BLT with fries = genius! Now hubby wants no other BLT! The fries were hot and golden crispy but so soft and potatoey inside. We'll be back!"
1262,"No frills seafood here. Exactly what we were expecting and what we wanted. Outdoor and bar seating available. Might have to wait for a seat during lunch and dinner hours. I opted for a medium cup of the seafood chowder and a lobster roll. The seafood chowder is the same base as the clam chowder and was absolutely loaded with clams, lobster, and shrimp. Lobster roll had light mayo and a great bun. Local brewery Shipyard's Pumpkinhead was on tap. All in all a great meal."
1263,"Went to Gilberts for dinner a few days ago. A nice outdoor setting quality Maine favorites. Enjoyed the muscles, chowder and fried kalimari. Service was prompt and enjoyable. Make sure to check the specials to really get a bang for your buck."
1264,The chowder was okay and i thought the lobster was going to be hot on the naked lobster roll.  The search continues for the best lobster roll.
1265,"This place is sort of a no frills place to get lunch or dinner. It is located in downtown by the water. I'm sure during nice weather it's probably extremely hard to get a table.

I was in Portland for Christmas with my daughter and we wanted some more lobster and other before leaving the next day. We originally went to another place in the area but then left because the menu wasn't what we expected.

Gilberts isn't fancy. They serve you on paper plates and plastic cubs. It's a bit messy inside and there was a little wait for a table at 3 pm. We finally got a seat and the waitress was so very friendly and accommodating. She brought us water while we perused the laminated menus that are on the table. They also have daily specials on a chalkboard on the side. The specials were pretty reasonable.

My daughter ordered from the special menu. She got a half lobster blt wth fries and a small clam chowder for $16 or $18.  Can't remember the exact price. But the lobster meat was tasty,  fresh and a whole lot of claw meat. The bacon was crisp and bread was buttery. They fries were crispy and hot and the chowder had bacon and potatoes in it with oyster crackers on the side.  Well worth the price.

I ordered fried calamari for $8 as an appetizer and they were cooked well.  Nice and crisp with good flavor.

I ordered a lobster roll but I did have to pay more to substitute my chips for onion rings. that was $3.99 extra which I shouldn't have gotten because you get a really huge portion and after the fact we realized we could have shared my daughter's fries. But the lobster roll was really good.  It wasn't overly dressed. There was a lot of claw meat on a toasty, buttery hot dog roll with just a bit of lettuce. I enjoyed it.

Upon entrance you might be tempted to leave but the food was really good and so was thev service.  There were only two waitresses and it was pretty crowded yet they were hustling. The food came out really quickly as well."
1266,"Service was great, but my pet peeve is when a server drops the check without seeing if we wanted anything else. Should have read the reviews but we were in a rush and settled. That's about it."
1267,"We came here based on a recommendation from the app #BringFido as we were looking for a restaurant in Portland that we could bring our pups.  This place was great along with the food and service!  They have individual lights on each of the umbrellas so you don't have to worry about not seeing in the dark which I thought was a great touch.
My husband had the whole fried clams special which he said were very good and he is picky about his fried clams.  I had a #lobsterroll which was very good.  And of course we got a welldone burger only for the pups which they did not complain and quite thoroughly enjoyed."
1268,Great little place in downtown Portland. The staff was friendly and the food was great. The seafood chowder is one of the best things i've ever eaten. Definitely check it out if you're in town.
1269,Lobster was delicious and our server was excellent!! We asked how to cut the lobsters and she showed us how to do it easily step by step.
1270,"We had a little bit of a wait for lunch here, but not too bad.  We ordered a clam meal and a haddock sandwich.  Both meals were delicious and enough to fill us up.  The staff was friendly and quick.  The only complaint I have is the clam chowder.  It was too potato-ey.  It didn't taste like true New England Clam Chowder to me, and that's what I went in there for."
1271,Gilbert's attracts locals as well as the tourists looking for food in the Old Port. The clam chowder is the best in Portland and I'd say top three anywhere. It's thick and has a generous portion of clams. The lobster roll is also a go-to for me. In the fall/winter the dining room is great but arrive early as it fills up for lunch. In the summer the back deck is shaded and also gets full around lunch and dinner time. The staff here is no-nonsense but friendly. If you're in Portland you have to eat at least one meal at Gilbert's!!
1272,"Great service. No complaint. 
A hidden gems I think. 

Most restaurant around have 2 hours waiting line. Here, there is no line. We was doubt about food quality at first as there was no line comparing to others.  

We ordered lobster soup, fried scallop, steam lobster, lobster sandwiches, steamed mussels. 

Scallop is fresh and sweet.  Lobster stew has lots of lobster and taste great.  Stew is flavorful, aromatic, and has plenty of lobster meats.  Fresh and plenty of lobster meats on the sandwiches as well. 

Recommended.  I also have Allagash white (draft beer). 

Everyone in our group love it."
1273,"I'm surprised that Gilbert's Chowder does not get closer to a 5 star rating...maybe locals have different preferences. But from this visitor from the East Coast, the chowder itself worth 1000 stars. So the place dares to claim of having an award winning chowder, and boy, does it live up to the reputation! The chowder is silky, rich & creamy packed with lots of seafood and other intangibles (e.g. comfort, hope, LOVE and all the good things) - one sip of it is all that it takes to temporarily make you believe that maybe, just maybe, there is more to this life than whatever the evil world out there.. oops.. off track. Anyhow, all I'm saying is the chowder is off the chart.. probably top 2 best clam chowder places I ever had (other being the pike place chowder in WA). GET these while you are in Portland! Skip the lobster roll.. it is decent / good but I've had better at other places.

Fun fact: They do sell the chowder by the gallon! First time seeing this flyer anywhere at a chowder selling place.. I guess only in Maine..LOL"
1274,"We recently made one of our biannual pilgrimages to Gilbert's for the delightfully fresh seafood and hearty chowder. Service is attentive, informed, and welcoming; always comfortable ambience; never rushed; conducive to conversation. A humble abode (unadorned but clean tables, plastic utensils/paper plates but authentic food) with stalwart focus on a half dozen cardinal sea food dishes. Portions generous; value terrific, taste FRESH, the sine qua non of our seafood bliss. Shipyard on tap. (Today, best fish sandwich I ever experienced.)Yes, at Gilbert's!!"
1275,"So this place was super fun! When you walk in the front its your typical bar type atmosphere. Smells like a bar, decor and atmosphere of a bar but there is more. Lots more. The back outdoor patio is right near the water, you can smell the ocean. 

This place taught me that I do not like lobster tail, but my date loved it and even finished mine. At $22 + dollars a crab, it comes with a small 1/4 of a corn on the cob and an entire set of tools for your lobster adventure. Everything was fresh and I wish I would have tried the chowder. It comes in a big bread bowl and looked amazing from one table over.

Next time."
1276,"When in Portland you must eat seafood and chowder, if you find a place that also offers outdoor seating on the bay then it's a no-brainer for lunch.  We were lucky enough to find seating on a busy Saturday afternoon at Gilbert's.  The dock was set up as seat yourself so if you're with a larger party, like we were, make sure you're ready to wait by the bar for a bit.  We didn't wait long but we still ordered a beer in the meantime :)  

The menu claimed that the clam chowder was award winning and after tasting it, there was no dispute. Since we were staying in Maine for a few days I had already tried a few cups of chowder but this was absolutely the best one, by far.  I was tempted to get the seafood chowder in a bread bowl but I opted for a cup of clam chowder and a lobster roll instead.  The lobster roll was also so good and I will say that the pricing was on par with the rest of the dockside restaurants in the area.  

I also need to say that our waitress was attentive and very helpful with recommendations, she also helped us with separate checks which is not always accommodated.  We also did not wait very long for our food at all, while it was so nice to sit in the shade on the water, nobody likes to wait long for their orders.  A very positive experience overall!"
1277,"We tried their clam chowder and it was good. I would definitely go back again and try their other chowders. They are located right by the water, and they have a large outdoor patio"
1278,"Great restaurant! We arrived unknowingly 15 mins before they open and the server was extremely nice and allowed us to sit and order drinks while they finish opening up. The ambiance is very causal. They have a dining area, bar area and outdoor patio section. The clam chowder was very filling and delicious! The lobster roll was fresh and came out on a buttered bun with chips! The prices were reasonable and the location is located right on the pier of downtown!"
1279,"For a chowder place, the chowder wasn't very good...

We came on a busy holiday weekend, so everything ran out. We managed to snatch the last mussels. They were small but plentiful. We also got clam chowder and fries. This was meal was our appetizer before Eventide. The chowder was okay... not the best... or even noticeable clam pieces. 

What stole the show was their crispy hot fries! It was sooo good. I wish we could have gotten a large."
1280,"Awesome place with outdoor seating right downtown and a nice view of the water. There was live music coming from next door which added to the atmosphere, and lots of people coming and going for fun people watching. It's seat yourself, and we were able to catch a table as the last guests were leaving. They cleared the table quickly as we sat down. Food and service were great. Public parking right next door made it easy in and out!"
1281,The chowder was fantastic!  We got the clam and seafood chowder. The seafood chowder may have been in my top three best soups! Very worth the visit
1282,"Best clam chowder ever & i was once visiting a planet that was entirely made up of cannibalistic clams & boy could they cook! This place puts that whole planet to shame.  If you're a local, or a very discerning humanoid type being who eats in the traditional mouth-feeding manner, this place is obviously where you'd be. Want to eat like a local, affordable, DELICIOUS, & very importantly-fresh? Go to Gilbert's! Gilbert himself is now well over 110 years old, but wow can he fry some scallops! If you eat here and don't like the quality & freshness, then you should eat here anyway, because you need some education."
1283,"Great Chowder and great service. There was 9 of us that showed up hungry on Friday night, 07/13/18. 
We all went with the specials. Either fried scallops or whole belly clams with fries and cup of chowder. All was cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were just enough. We will be back the next time we're up that way."
1284,"More like 3.5 stars but we really kinda like this place so rounded up! It's super low-key, totally Old Port-style, nothing fancy but you will get great whole lobsters and amazing service. While we walked in around 8:30pish, the place was still jam packed but we didn't feel like we had to wait too long for anything.

We split the Twin lobster dinner. For $32.95, you get two steamed 1.5 lb lobsters, corn, and choice of a side-- went with rice pilaf-- wines and beers ran about $5/$6 and also split a bowl of their clam chowdah. The chowder tasted very thick and almost glue-like. I think they put way too much cornstarch or flour in it. It was tasty though with chunks of potatoes and clams. Will need to try it again earlier in the day, perhaps. The lobster was really sweet and cooked perfectly! They felt like ""shedders"" (recently molted lobsters) as the shell was quite easy for me to ""crack and peel"" and the meat was tender and sweet, I didn't even need much butter to go with it. We sat out back on the patio and got to hear the live band performing next door. Whoo hoo! All in all, the one entree and small soup was enough to satisfy us both before a night of partying. A very no frills place where you can grab a casual bite for a decent price!"
1285,"I was just browsing the list of recent reviews on this place, and wow....this is a shameful representation of Portland's wonderful food scene! My mom even said this as we feigned remote enjoyment of our meal: ""I feel bad if tourists come to Portland and eat HERE!"" 

I just don't have a single good thing to say about this place. It's casual, sure, but there was no quality to a single morsel of food... 

We started with the steamed mussels. They were small, and that's ok, not everything I put in my mouth has to be ginormous; the problem was in the freshness. Every 4th mussel or so, my mom and I would spit into our napkin. It's sort of a rule that if any shellfish tastes bad/funny, you shouldn't eat it. I felt like we were playing a game of diarrhea roulette.

My mom tried to ask the waitress a little bit about the chowder since there are about 5 different kinds, and she decided on fish. She also ordered fried scallops and french fries. I ordered the salad with lobster. 

The chowder? Where do I even begin. I can understand someone who likes thick chowder, but there's a difference between thick and a total turnoff. Guys, I'm sure you've said this about women,so take that mantra and I'm sure you can empathize with the condition of this chowder. This chowder was literally not hot. My mom also couldn't find any fish in it, despite the menu that offers such distinct choices. She described the texture as pudding, and didn't eat more than a bite (which, in my family, is unheard of). It was just appalling that a chowder house does not have good chowder. It would be like going to a strip club, asking for a lap dance, and receiving the dancer's performance of the macarena instead.  

My mom said the fried foods were flavorless, and I noticed that the portion was smaller than a typical fried seafood plate in this area. I didn't try any, but it's pretty hard to screw up fried food. It requires minimal culinary skill to find fresh food, season it, and throw it in the fryer. Normally my mom returns her food when something isn't right, but I know she was holding back.  It just seemed overwhelming to have to tell the waitress that EVERYTHING was bad.It was actually sad for me to watch her pretend that everything was OK when it wasn't. It's a lot of money to pay for something that my mom didn't even want to give to homeless people, due to its poor quality. 

My salad was heaping with lettuce, but the fact that it was on a standard paper plate just made no sense. I was playing Jenga with my own food: if I moved the wrong piece of lettuce, an avalanche of lettuce would fall off the plate. The lobster on top was dry, flavorless, and a portion that is less than an entire lobster. Unless of course my lobster had an Asian American tail like myself (practically non existent), this was just a small helping, and not worth the $13. How does a restaurant in the lobster capital screw this up!?

I will never go back here. I can't believe that so many tourists stop here, or that they even maintain a halfway decent rating. This was just horrendous.

The only thing about dining here that made this night memorable was:
1) My mom and I spent 20 minutes driving around Portland looking for homeless people, but only stumbled upon junkies who seemed, if possible, only more disinterested in shitty fried scallops than us. This induced serious laughter. 

2) We imitated Robert Irvine on the drive home, shouting insults about Gilbert's in British accents as he would on his show ""Restaurant: Impossible."""
1286,Earring our way through Maine we stumbled onto Gilbert's. We always get clam chowder and a lobster roll whenever we try a new place. Chowder was good but the seafood chowder was AMAZING. To put things into perspective we have tried 23 new places in 4 days.  Lots of food but the five of us get a bite or two then we order more if we like the place.  We totally changed our itinerary around Gilbert's hour. We sat in The parking lot for 25 minutes before they opened Monday morning just to get more chowder before Went up the coast. Came back to Portland three days later just to get more seafood chowder. Gilberts is very reasonably priced.  Food is very good cold beer too. Dine inside or on back deck. Highly recommended this place.
1287,"Whenever I visit Portland, I immediately get excited about the fact that I will be going to Gilbert's Chowder House. Growing up in Ohio you always hear about how amazing Maine lobster is and Gilbert's certainly did not disappoint. The setting of the restaurant is laid back with everything being served on paper plates, plastic forks, and stellar service. 

Appetizer: for the appetizer, we got their steamed muscles, which came in a large portion (can serve up to 4 people) and was extremely fresh. 

Entree: Their fried calamari was perfectly fried and the squid cooked to the right tenderness. We also got their lobster roll (lobster meat lightly tossed in mayonnaise and served on a toasted bun) which was by far my favorite item there."
1288,"We ended up in downtown Portland when my friend  wanted a Maine lobster after a day of antiquing. We hunted around to a lot of long waits and crowded bars but Gilbert's was half full. Usually, that'd make me wary, but we were treated to patio dining and a great seafood dinner. The lobster was great, perfectly cooked fish and chips and clam chowder were the best. I would definitely return as a seafood fan."
1289,Delicious lobster rolls and fries and a reasonable price! I would definitely recommend!
1290,"First time coming here, I got the seafood chowder in a bread bowl  It was delicious lots of baby shrimp and lots of large chunks of lobster claws and the bread tasted good too. My dad got the lobster stew said it was great.  My siblings both got the scallops and clam chowder special they said they were cooked perfectly.  My husband got the haddock and it didn't last long on his plate.  Price was good for portions. I definitely recommend the chowders in a bread bowl. If it's a nice day eat outside by water."
1291,"Food was absolutely miserable. Went there twice, ordered the clam chowder and seafood chili chowder.

Their customer service is decent, and of course location is prime. I just honestly don't know how they stay in business if their food is so....bleh."
1292,"Lobster roll was okay. It was more expensive for Maine lobster here than to get main laborer 1500 miles away. 2 lobster rolls, a beer and a mixed drink with tax and tip was $71. Food was not worth the price and we ended up getting pizza later because we were starving. Had the feel of a down home lobster joint, but wasn't impressed."
1293,"There are way better options in town...

During our visit to Portland this was unfortunately our worst dining experience.  We needed somewhere quick to get a bite before taking a sail so we decided to pop in.  When we walked in it was pretty empty inside.  No one acknowledged us so we just took a seat.  We sat there for about 5 minutes while the staff hung out and ignored us.  We finally got up and sat at the bar where they were all congregating.  That seemed to work as the bartender seemed willing to help us.  We each got a lobster roll, our first one in Portland, and man were we disappointed.  While the bun was well toasted the Lobster was freezing cold and completely lacked flavor.  As we were eating I noticed the kitchen was just dumping lobster from baggies into the bun and adding one piece of lettuce.  Oh and to boot the rolls were $17.95 each, a total rip off for what they deliver.  If you're looking for a good lobster roll skip this place.  Their French fries were the only saving grace to this highly disappointing meal."
1294,"After finally ordering, we sat for 25 minutes waiting on chowder - our appetizer. They can't blame it on being short-handed. They served full meals to others who ordered after us. Poor, poor service. The place is not very clean either. But it's okay!!! We got a GREAT referral to a nearby place: The Highroller Lobster Co. where we had great food and a great experience. Thanks guys!"
1295,"I ordered the clam chowder, calamari, and the lobster roll. They were all delicious. The fried foods still tasted very light compared to other fried foods I've eaten. 

The place gives off more of a dive bar vibe, but I ate dinner there with my husband in a Sunday evening and it was a good time. 

Customer service was good, pricing was fair, atreet parking available. 

If ever I'm in Portland again, I would eat here and would recommend it to small groups of 3-4."
1296,"If you are seeking clam chowder when you come to Portland, go to Gilbert's Chowder House! This place is adorable, and the waitresses are fun. They have a cute little patio outside that overlooks the water, too. My husband and I only had their clam chowder here so we can't speak for the rest of the menu, but the clam chowder served in a bread bowl was delicious! There were huge chunks of clam served in the bread bowl that also comes with oyster crackers, butter and hot sauce (if you prefer). I have tasted a lot of different clam chowders in my day, and this place is legit! 

They have a great selection of beers on tap, too. Prices are reasonable, and food is great. What more can you ask for?"
1297,"I mean if you expect a good restaurant with service, don't come here. I think the owner needs more helpers for the busy season. The food is very traditional American style, they deep fried almost everything, but it's not too oily. The good thing is they served quickly if you can find someone to take your order."
1298,"0 stars if possible holy s***. I was even ready to give them a decent review after reading all the negative because the service was fine. Chowders had next to no seafood in them. After about 4-5 bites I looked to the side of my bread bowl and there was a freaking USED RUBBER GLOVE ON MY PLATE!!!!!! Ew. Ew ew ee ewwwwwwwwwww. Hair in my food? Fine, I pick it out and keep eating. Flies, ants..doesn't bother me at all. But a used rubber glove...just unacceptable on so many levels. Not to mention completely disgusting. DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT. THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHER PLACES IN PORTLAND!!!!!"
1299,"Pleasantly surprised by this little hole in the wall. It feels like the type of place where the fisherman frequent when in port. It's that good! Everything from soups, stews, and chowdahs to the best fish sandwich I have ever had in my life. The fish was flaky and moist and fried to perfection, the bread was soft and delicious, the homemade tartar sauce...I NEED A JAR!!! 
The atmosphere is simple and homey feeling. Pick a table and enjoy your experience. 
We had the feeling of home in this place. It was warm and inviting, our waitress was really nice and easy going. She asked us where we were visiting from snd if we were enjoying our stay. She was able to help us with choosing between items, the menu looked so good that we just wanted everything. We sat near the kitchen window and everything that came out of it looked incredible. 
It was the freshest of the fresh seafood, clams, fillet fish, oysters, all fresh and from the waters around us! 
We really enjoyed this place. It will go on our list so that next time we are in Maine we will make it a point to stop in for some chowdah and a fish sandwich."
1300,"I got the Seafood Chowder and the Crab Meat Roll. The chowder was packed with all kinds of fish, shrimp, clams, and lobster meat. It was nice and creamy with great flavor. The crab meat roll was great! Tons of meat and flavorful. If I visit Portland again, I would come back to get the Seafood Chowder in a bread bowl."
1301,"On a cold day grab a seat at the bar and a cup of chowder! It was tasty, filling, and fast!"
1302,"Got the double seafood chowder bread bowl...  it's great but could be hotter. It was a rainy, brisk day, and boy would that soup hit the spot if it were hot. It wasn't cold, but... it's a small complaint. it was very delicious! Big too. Really hit the spot.

The stars are mostly for the friendly waitress. I forgot her name, but she was a sweet woman. 

Chowder good... waitress good... just turn up the temperature of that chowder a bit and we're golden."
1303,Enjoyed dinner at Gilbert's; the clam strips; fresh and delicious; clam chowder bland and too thick! The service was  pleasant and atmosphere very New England. Will for sure return again for the clams!
1304,"Gilbert's is a pretty standard dive eatery. I visited during a Maine road trip in August 2017. Chowder was pretty good. Lobster roll was a little weak. Beer selection was okay. A little pricey for what it was. The shop was not very busy the night I visited, which is great because everywhere else was booked!"
1305,Ordered the 1/2 lobster blt and cup of chowder special. Disappointed with time lobster and the brad wasn't toasted but enjoyed the chowder. Felt touristy overall. Other dishes I saw going out looked better.
1306,"I ordered the whole belly clam special and it was so unappetizing. The clam bellies were so black and pouring out. I have never seen clams like that in my entire life. It was disgusting!! I completely did not eat those clams. I ate some of the strips. Even yet some of the bellies looked grayish. I told the waitress and she was NO help. She said oh we asked the chef and he said the clams are in mating season blah blah do you want something else (after I already finished my entire meal). She was at the bar texting on her phone the entire time. Just sitting there texting. I tried to get her attention for napkins and she never came over. So I went into the men's room that was open to grab some damn paper towels. 

I cannot believe they actually serve clams like that. I told her that I have never seen that before and she was unapologetic. A waitress should try to help the customer as much as possible. Yet she instead did not offer me a refund or a discount. I paid $17.95 for a small clam chowder and French fries since I did not eat the damn clams. It was obvious by the napkins filled with black soot that I did not eat the clams and that I did not enjoy this meal. She told me to come tomorrow to speak to the manager but I told her no because I'm not from here. She just said oh, and nothing further. Absolutely horrible customer service. I could not even believe it. My friend had the haddock meal special and said it was good so that is the only reason this is 2 stars. If I could give it zero I would have."
1307,"I only had one night in Maine, so I had to make sure the place I chose for dinner was top notch.  I almost decided to go back to the same place I went 10 years ago, DeMillo's but decided against it because it was very touristy.  After asking the staff at the hotel I was staying at plus looking on Yelp, I decided to stop by Gilbert's, and boy oh boy am I glad I did.

Upon entering, it's very basic inside, hole in the wall feel, and not fancy; but I don't look for fancy when I eat, I look for good food, and the wall with all the awards they've won assured me I wouldn't be disappointed.  Was greeted by a very friendly lady who would be our server.  I'm assuming she was the manager/owner, but whatever her title is, she was awesome.  Was great to us and treated my daughter like she was family.

Since I was in Maine, there was only one logical meal for me to order...cheeseburger.  JK, of course I ordered steamed lobsters.  Twin lobsters for about $32...a lot cheaper than DeMillo's.  Lobster was really good and weren't super small.  The clam chowder was amazing as well and can definitely understand why they've won numerous awards.

One of the better dinners I've had in my life.  Highly recommend stopping by here for lunch and/or dinner.  Totally worth it as the chowder and lobster are really good, only beaten by the incredible service from the friendly staff."
1308,A little bit of wait but well worth it even under the rain. Amazing seafood chowder and truly amazing lobster roll. If your ever in town make it a note to leave some time to visit and eat here. Highly recommended
1309,"I had a hearty cup of seafood chowder that was packed with loads of treasure! I got lobster roll on the side that was really great too! Simple yet delicious. Good service and Great food, Touchdown Spike!"
1310,Great service but where was the fish?  Don't expect me to return when you give me a child-like portion of fish.  I left hungry and won't be coming back.  BTW: I live in Portsmouth and am not some ignorant tourist.
1311,"Heavy, no flavor batter. An $18.95 whole belly clam platter will net you five clams.  Chowder is meh.  Too sweet, heavy on the sherry.  Skip this place"
1312,"This was recommended on a Portand blog entry so was excited to try this place. Parking is hard on this street but they have their own limited lot. We managed to get a spot. Service was friendly, very homey/dinner feeling inside. Ordered a lobster platter, clam chowder and clam platter. Maybe because it was November but it was a bit small, very heavy on the fries, and a bit expensive. Maybe you're paying for the location. Glad we stopped by and tried it out."
1313,"You don't get many firsts in life.   I moved here from NC and wanted my first meal as a Mainer to be one I'd never forget.  

Gilberts Chowder house definitely didn't disappoint.  I love the small quant casual environment.   The waitress was extremely nice and cordial -- she recommended that I taste a few of the local brews before deciding and I chose a shipyard export.... amazing!!!

... and claim chowder in a bread bowl was creamy succulent, and frankly out of this world!

I'll definitely be going back."
1314,"Casual, great food! Quick. I'd go back any day! Fair prices. Especially great for lunch."
1315,Super Seafood Chowder lived up to its name. It was overflowing with shrimp and lobster. Barely any room for the oyster crackers.
1316,"Stopped in for dinner. Staff directed us to seat ourselves so we choice outside. Great choice got to listen to band at next restuarant for free.
Sever was patient with my wife who changed her mind several times on what see wanted to eat. Food came quick and was hot and tastie.
Prices reasonable. Alot of the food is fried so you must be aware of that. Would go back!"
1317,Their Clam chowder bread bowl is amazing ! We sat in their outdoor patio! Love the atmosphere !
1318,"Just what the doctor ordered for a decent lobster roll, fresh, great taste. All the locals where here so they must do something right, and they did! Nice job!"
1319,So I had back to back lobster roll lunches.  One in Bar Harbor and now today in Portland.  Both excellent.  Here's what I enjoyed about Gilbert's....  LOTS of lobster!  Packed with meat and you could just see the claws hanging out of the perfect roll.  They also went very light on the mayo which I prefer as the lobster should be the star.  Chips right out of a bag accompany the roll but it looked like there were other options if you prefer.  I was there for the lobster so this was not a big deal.  We also had the clam chowder and it was very good.  The thick stuck to your ribs variety! Don't be put off by the less than glamorous look of Gilbert's.  The food and service were both fantastic!
1320,Nice location right on the waterfront.  The chowders were super salty and thick. With the chowder house as their name I expected the chowder to be perfectly seasoned and consistent.  The seafoods that come  with the seafood chowder were tasteless. The fried food are the typical greasy batter and French fried.  Two stars for the location and the friendly server. The food received zero star.
1321,"We stopped here after a bad experience at another restaurant next door. Seat yourself in the lil hole in the wall. Immediately a waitress came over to say hi. We placed drinks orders, only took 2 mins to receive (GREAT). Placed simple fish and chip order reasonably priced. Food came out within 10 mins piping hot. You get plenty of food for your money. And it was delicious! We also had a Bailey's and coffee to warm us up (YUMMM). All disposable utensils but the good stuff. Overall a very nice experience!!"
1322,I love eating at Gilbert's!!!   Their chowder is so delicious and I love the lobster BLT!!
1323,"Fresh seafood, prepared quickly and excellently.  Not a fancy establishment, but people don't come here for the decor.  Six beers on tap, several are local brews.  They even have both seafood and beef chili,  but didn't try either.  Seafood chowder and the fish and chips were excellent.  You can pay more elsewhere, but it won't be better."
1324,"If you like chowder, this is definite stop when visiting downtown Portland. No frills, no fuss. Just good food with good service."
1325,"after I was assured they served only fresh lobster meat , they served frozen lobster meat on my lobster roll.  it was gross, no flavor and had lots of water inside. yuk!

also their clam chowder was a very poor thick concoction, very little flavor, cream, clams and potatoes.  Come on man you're on the waterfront, if you can't make chowder use Cambells which would be better. I was so Piss......"
1326,"I had the lunch portion of fried haddock which was more than I could eat and delicious! My husband had the Super Seafood Chowder and that, too, was delicious. There was a mountain of seafood in there, including some huge chunks of lobster! So glad we chose Gilbert's!"
1327,"My first time in Portland and I love steamers! We just happened to find this place. It did not disappoint! A very casual eatery. My friend had lobster roll. She said it was delicious. My steamers were so sweet and the beer... what could be better than steamers and beer. They have an outside eating area, but it was too cool to sit there. Thank you for the delicious meal!"
1328,Outstanding food. Never had better clam chowder or onion rings. My husband doesn't like Cole slaw and our server brought fries in addition without being expected to. Service was quick and friendly. Very highly recommend.
1329,"I love chowder, so I had to check this place out. They do have a few reserved parking spots, but at lunch on a weekday, they were all taken. We found some on street parking not too far away.

The place is pretty small, but welcoming. We grabbed a table right away and were greeted by a lovely server that made us feel like locals. The menus are at the tables and pretty simple. Choose your chowder and size, along with other great choices.

My wife ordered the seafood chowder, which was bursting with seafood and no room for potatoes! I had the clam chowder, which was nice and thick, just the way I like it. It did have a lot of potatoes unfortunately, and for my tastes, should have tasted a bit creamier, but it was good nonetheless.

Our daughter got the kid's chicken tenders with French fries being the real star here.

My wife also had to have a lobster roll while in Portland, and she was very happy with the portions of lobster crammed in the bread, with a single piece of lettuce shielding the bread from getting soggy.

This place is a great standard that won't let you down!"
1330,"I mean... Who can say no to twin lobsters with 2 sides for $34? Delicious, fresh, and plenty of food to put you in a seafood coma"
1331,"Four of us went downtown to grab a bite to eat at 1pm on a Saturday. First time in the place. Walked in, ok pretty busy. Stood there feeling dumb, do we sit ourselves or wait. No acknowledgement from staff at all. No eye contact. The two open tables had dirty plates so we're not sure if we should sit. Stood for 5 minutes, no exaggeration. Felt like ghosts. Even a ""give us a minute to seat you"" would have been fine! I have no problem with that, but to be ignored... We left and went to another pub. Food looked good, but have no idea if it is."
1332,"My boyfriend and I stopped by for a late lunch after reading some decent reviews. We both got lobster rolls and then shared fried oysters and fried scallops. Food was pretty good but nothing special. It's a casual seat-yourself kind of place so if you don't want anything fussy, it's not a bad restaurant to eat at.

I did hear their chowder is amazing but we didn't get a chance to try it this time around but might try it next time we are in the area."
1333,"Can't beat the chowder
Went there for lunch the staff was very down to earth.
Would go back in a second."
1334,"I was looking forward to a great lobster eating experience and Gilbert Chowder didn't disappoint. The concierge suggested several restaurants and ended by saying that Gilbert's Chowder was the locals favorite. The staff is friendly, efficient and skilled. This is a great spot for family and dates. The food is superb. I had twin lobsters, seafood Chowder, fries and slaw. I ate and enjoyed everything. I had my birthday dinner at a five star restaurant last night  and the food at Gilberts was superior. I will be recommending this spot  as a ""good eats "" stop for those that seek the real meal deal. Drop your formalities and enjoy some great seafood.
I paid 80.00 for one lobster @ five star and 35.00 for twin lobsters @ Gilberts."
1335,yummy fresh l twin Maine Lobster 30.95 with corn on the cob and french fries.  Need I say  more
1336,It was alright. The clam chowder was more like potato soup. Not what I was expecting based on previous reviews. Had the lobster roll and fried scallops.
1337,Holy chowder! This place is awesome. I would highly recommend stopping in for a cup of chowder and a beer.
1338,Nice place food was EXCELLENT....I will be back soon...love the clam chowder....our waiter was good and very friendly....
1339,"This place was awesome! As the sole weirdo in Portland who doesn't like seafood, Gilbert's had a chicken and corn chowder option for me and it was delicious. Decent beers on tap as well as great prices!"
1340,"Stumbled upon this place on my last trip to Portland, ME. As we were craving Lobster Rolls, this place definitely fulfilled our craving and were definitely cheaper than what we pay for back in MA. The restaurant has outdoor and indoor seating and has a selection of rolls and fried seafood dishes such as clam strips, fish & chips, etc. I would highly recommend grabbing their Maine Lobster Roll and a cup of chowder while you dine here! Definitely wouldn't mind stopping by here again."
1341,"Always busy for a good reason! Awesome little chowder shack along dock with a delicious bread bowl of seafood chowder! Great little beer list and friendly, quick staff. The wait goes by quickly and is well worth it. A great first stop when getting into Portland!"
1342,"Perfect Portland spot! 

We enjoyed our lunch at Gilbert's. First of all, there was onsite parking, a nice touch. The restaurant interior is old-fashioned and funky, with big chalkboard menus all over the place. The patio off the back of the restaurant was just what I was looking for with little picnic tables and navy-blue umbrellas with beer advertising on them. We sat at the end and had a nice little view of the water through the lattice fence.

The lobster roll was delicious and reasonably-priced. We also had onion rings, which were light and not at all greasy. The fish sandwich (haddock) was delicious as well.

I recommend Gilbert's as a true experience of Maine. We were early to lunch, but by the time we finished, people were waiting in line. It seems to be a popular place for tourists and locals alike."
1343,"This chowder was a joke... I got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and all it was was potato soup. Tasted nothing like seafood, maybe 3 small bits of clam. It was a waste of money after reading multiple blogs and recommendations. I don't understand why it is rated so high. Progresso did it better."
1344,This place slammed it. Fast service and great food. Slightly expensive but I guess that's because it's on the main drag.
1345,"Good New England Staples, like clam chowder and lobster rolls. The restaurant itself isn't much to write home about but if you're looking for a simple place to eat on the wharf, it seems like this is where the fishermen come to eat. Fairest prices I came across while in town."
1346,While vacationing in Maine we stopped in Gilbert's for some lobster stew. This was delicious. Thin cream based soup with so much lobster meat.  A truly enjoyable stew.
1347,"This place was suggested by local folk. Very pleased with the proportioning and quality of the calamari, thought I'd had the best till I came here. I questioned wether or not I could finish the crab roll due to it size! Don't forget homemade onion rings! and a huge helping of slaw"
1348,"Outdoor seating which is nice, the clam strips were very good and so was the fried shrimp. Service was very fast and the prices are decent for Portland. Everything tasted very fresh."
1349,"Last night in Portland and had to find some good chowder - this place did NOT disappoint.  I had the clam chowder which was so good, both flavor and consistency. My boyfriend had the seafood chili which had a great mix of meat and just the right about of spice. Not only was the food great, but the staff was so friendly and energetic. We ate at the bar our bartender/server was Matt. He was SUPER personable and took great care of us! Glad we stopped in!!"
1350,"I grew up in Portland and came back to visit on Memorial Day weekend.  We decided to swing by Gilbert's on Saturday for lunch.  We had a party of 6 (5 adults and a baby) and were told that we were too large of a party.  We had to sit at two separate tables, which was incredibly strange.  The floors, chairs and tables are in disrepair.  While checking to see if a table was available on the patio, one of the waitresses (wearing overalls, black hair in pigtails) slammed into me while I was holding my baby and didn't apologize.  That should have been our first sign to leave.

Long story short - one table of 3 received our food.  Our other table of 3 NEVER RECEIVED THEIR FOOD.  We waited for over an hour after ordering and eventually had to leave.  When we asked the waitress for the food's status (after waiting patiently for 45+ minutes) she freaked out.  Instead of apologizing and going to check on the food she said ""Well you must have ordered something hard!  It's not my fault!  It's the kitchen's!""  They ordered fried shrimp, a cup of chowder and a grilled cheese.  Also if something is ""too hard"" for the kitchen to make, why is it on your menu?  Completely ridiculous.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in Portland... don't waste your time or money here."
1351,"Here for Father son fishing trip. Was looking forward to some lobster and chowder. Man I got it. The food is awesome. We had Seafood chowder and I think there was a half pound of fresh lobster in there along with the shrimp and clams. Absolutely wonderful. Fresh steamed lobster was fresh steamed lobster.  The only reason I didn't give this place a five was that it is supposed to be on the water. You can smell the water and hear the seabirds but about all your going to see is an alley.  I guess it is at the end of a canal but like I said you can't really see the water. 

Oh and the service was fantastic 

PS I had no idea the water was so nasty in Portland Maine. The water is cleaner and prettier in GALVESTON TX and smells better."
1352,"You must try this place!  When in New England, you must enjoy some chowder, and here they do not disappoint!  The place is inconspicuous and un-pretentious, and absolutely amazing! The lobster rolls are also fresh and amazing!  They do it right with no frills.  Come by and grab a cuppa chowder and enjoy the harbor view next time you're in Portland!!"
1353,Returned to Gilbert's after being away 15 years.  Took my boyfriend for the first time.  LOVED it!  Our waitress Maria was so genuinely personable and sweet!  Went there 3x on our trip and never a single disappointment.  The lobster rolls were nicely toasted which was unlike other places we went during this trip.  One of our favorite places in all of our travels.
1354,"When you are approximately half a mile from Portland, Maine, you tell everybody that we need to make a detour to South Portland to grab lunch at Docks Seafood. That takes courage as everybody is antsy to get out of the car and check in to the hotel. Everybody is either to be really glad that you made that choice or they are highly upset. Docks Seafood is worth it and everybody was smiling at the end of the meal.  

This is a place where locals eat. If I lived around in the area, this would be my spot as usual. The staff was friendly and patient as there were so many food options to pick from. I ordered a lobster roll platter which comes with fries and cole slaw. One of the great things about this restaurant is that they have awesome tartar sauce. The food was on point and simply hit the spot. A quite simple and straight forward delicious lobster roll. We drove 5 hours to get some lobsters and it was well worth it. Thanks Docks."
1355,"Heard a lot about this place so decided to come. Drove down from Boston, Ma on a little getaway and heard this place was a local favorite. Smaller than I anticipated but still a fine looking establishment. Ample parking outside for the seating available inside anyways. First impressions when I entered was that it was definitely a place not catered to tourists. It had a very local establishment feel to it. I feel it embodies Maine as a whole if that makes sense. 

On the side was an area where it looks like they'd bring their Daily haul of fishing and store it in different containers. At first I was a little off put by it but it became more part of the decor than a decoration. 

The service was friendly but there wasnt anyone going around asking if we were enjoying our meal. I say that not as a negative but just so you dont expect to get table service besides the gentleman bringing me my order when it was done. 

Ordered the Lobster roll (obviously), a pint of fried clams with the bellies, small fries, Cole slaw and fish sandwich. Onto the good.. the clams were fantastic. Juicy, fresh and the price wasnt that bad but still a little on the higher side. The French fries felt home cut to me and I enjoyed it a lot. Right amount of seasoning and it was definitely fried to order. The tartar sauce was bomb which brought the clams and the fries together. 

The bad. The lobster roll was terrible. No tail meat (though for 18 dollars I wasnt expecting it to) and there wasnt much meat with mostly knuckles. It looked disappointing when I got served. No celery (I prefer a light sprinkle for the crunch factor), barely any mayo (again not bad but because of lack of celery it made the roll very plain) but the worst was that it was served in an untoasted/unbuttered roll. It felt cold, like it was sitting premade in their fridge because of it. I could live with no celery and very light mayo but the roll ruined it for me. Asked my wife about the fish sandwich and she said it was nothing to write home about. 

A. For parking, clams, fries and tartar sauce. 

D. For the fish sandwich

F. For the lobster roll which was what I was looking forward to the most."
1356,"I haven't had such an amazing lobster roll in such a long time, and Dock's provided you with a fully loaded roll that was more lobster than bread. Now that's a ratio I wish would be a standard everywhere!

The place is extremely clean, the service is super helpful and friendly, they will answer all your questions and recommend the best if you have undecided friends.

I could literally eat here all day everyday! Would recommend all to come here whenever your the area or just doing a quick trip to Maine!"
1357,"This was our first time in Maine and the minute we got off of the plane we wanted to try the best lobster Maine had to offer. After researching what seemed to be 5000 different spots and speaking to my frined who lives in Portland we decided to come here after seeing such great reviews and knowing that a lot of locals come here for some good grub!

We parked in the onsite parking lot and walked inside. It is a no-frills spot that looks exactly how I expected. It's a family owned, quiet spot that locals come to for a good meal. They had their menu on the wall with delicious options to choose from along with a specials board. 

My girlfriend and I stood gazing at the menu and all of its goodness, discussing how we wanted one of everything! We caught the attention of a gentleman I assume was the manager or owner who welcomed us and asked if we had any questions. We both decided to stick to the plan and order lobster. We both ordered the twin lobster special which was priced at $26. It came with two lobsters, a side of fries and coleslaw. 

We paid upfront and were handed a number. We picked a table and eagerly awaited our meal. We took a look around the restaurant and saw the live lobsters at the back of the establishment along with other goodies they sell. Our meals arrived and we dug in. We made a huge mess so its a good thing they have bibs for people like us! Every bite was perfection. The lobsters were cooked perfectly, a decent size and the meat was super sweet. Dipped in the butter they provide...Just HEAVEN. The fries were fresh and hot. The coleslaw wasn't that great, I've had much better, but honestly I didn't even care. The meal was that good.

The same gentleman came back to check up on us (as we were looking ravenous with our bibs splattered with lobster juice and butter) and asked how we were enjoying everything and made sure we had everything we needed. The service was great for the type of restaurant this is as you don't really have a server.

This place is great. If you want fresh delicious lobster, this place is a must. If only this place was here in Florida."
1358,"Superb and locally owned. I have fried clams and scallops, amazing. My wife had clam chowder and loved it. my daughter had the haddock and loved it, and my son had a burger , he liked it a lot. We would definitely return!!"
1359,"Docks is known for quality fresh seafood at an affordable price. 
Ask any local for suggestions on where to go for the full lobster experience and the answer will always be Docks Seafood. 
This laid-back eatery is also our friend's go-to spot when she and the hubs want to go all out and indulge in lobster and seafood. 

Lobsters are as fresh as can be! 
They have a tank full of live lobsters in the restaurant, makes for easy access for the chefs to grab when the orders come rolling in. 
It was so heartwarming to see the friendly staff take the time to show the kids the tank, even letting them hold the live lobsters (don't worry, the lobsters all had their claws banded). 

Come hungry, grab lots of paper towels and get ready to get down and dirty shelling your lobster. Everyone at our table got splattered with lobster juice while my friend's husband was picking apart his lobster. 
His wife was sitting to his right and somehow still managed to get a shot of lobster jizz right in the eyeball, lol!

Ordering system is swift and efficient. Walk up to place your order, find a table inside (or dine al fresco in their relaxing patio seating area) and listen for your order number to be called over the speakers. 

TWIN LOBSTER MEAL (market price was $26 for TWO lobsters, cole slaw and your choice of fries, baked potato or corn on the cob):
My friend's husband comes here just for this on the regular. 
I really don't have to say much about this amazing lobster steal/deal. 
Just peep this gorgeous plate. You're welcome. 
http://bit.ly/2SQw8GR

FRESH LOBSTER ROLL PLATE WITH FRIES & COLE SLAW ($19.99; or $15.99 for just the lobster roll):
http://bit.ly/2D4sPGS
http://bit.ly/2OsiDK8
-  Sweet hand-picked lobster meat from a whole lobster (yep, claws and tail meat). Effing delicious and worth every penny. 
- Unlike The Beach Plum's toasted split-top New England-style rolls, Docks serves theirs on untoasted, unbuttered soft hot dog buns. 
While some would say the roll lacks texture and think it's a bit dry from the lack of buttah, I was happy to be chowing down on tasty lobster for only $16!
- Added fries for $3.50. Thick-cut fries, could've been crispier.

FRESH CRAB MEAT ROLL ($9.99)
http://bit.ly/2Qj8qS5
http://bit.ly/2D4sPGS
If you are eating crab in Maine, it's likely going to be either their local Jonah Crabs or Peekytoe/Rock Crabs. 
Both have crab meat that's firmer than Blue Crabs, making them ideal for mixing for salads and sammies.

Since Rock Crab meat tends to have more color to them, I'm guessing my roll was full of Jonah Crab meat from it's finely-textured, all-white meat appearance.
- It tasted sweeter than Blue Crabs. Generous amount of crab. 
- Same untoasted, unbuttered hot dog as the lobster roll. 

LOBSTER QUESADILLA PLATE ($15.99, comes with cole slaw and your choice of fries, baked potato or corn on the cob. $2.50 extra for sweet potato fries or onion rings):
Sowee, my hungry friend devoured half of it before I could snap a pic. 
http://bit.ly/2DpedD0
- Tons of sweet claw and tail meat covered in cheddar cheese. Good stuffs. 

Overall, this was a delicious and memorable (lobster jizz and all) last meal to end with during our 36 hours in Maine. Thanks Docks!!

Hours: Open daily 11am-8pm
Parking: Ample parking in their private lot"
1360,The most delicious cocktail sauce I've ever had- the food was wonderful fresh and clean. We both got the seafood sampler and it was perfect for the price and portions   The staff were excellent and self service allows for a tip free dine.
1361,"Absolutely fantastic. We were in downtown Portland but parking was a bust, and everything seemed overpriced and touristy.

Fast-forward a quick drive to south Portland and we find Docks! The cashier was very patient with us as we ordered, answering any questions we had.

Lots of food, and plenty of fries (a little tooo much if you get what I'm saying). Fried oysters, two samplers (shrimp, haddock, clam cake), and grilled scallops. Not gonna lie, the clam cake wasn't my favorite, but everything else was so delicious! Clam chowder was phenomenal, and the lobster stew came with hella lobster.

Everything was piping hot, made to order, so no complaints!"
1362,"Note: there is a hidden camera in the women's restroom at Dock's. Is this legal? 

...
..."
1363,"Extremely long wait for take out tonight. The place was packed which is always a good sign when you're getting seafood. Despite the lengthy wait time my meal was perfect. Fried clam dinner, came with cole slaw, fries, and a roll with butter. The portion was huge and cooked perfectly. If you're looking for fresh quality seafood this is the place. Even though it's not in the heart of Portland this place is worth the detour! Will be back for sure!"
1364,"Great lobster roll. 
Excellent seafood chowder. 
Nice and clean restaurant.
Plenty of parking."
1365,"Love this place.  Great host, excellent food, and kids fridendly.  Of course, the price is more reasonable compared with the lobster restaurants in old town."
1366,Really liked it here. Good variety on the menu. Friendly staff. Pretty quick service. The sweet potato fries were delicious.
1367,"Came here for a quick weekday lunch to get some seafood. When you enter, they have a small board with the daily specials in front of you while the full menu is located on the wall. There were some pretty good specials such as a whole lobster plus sides for $18 or two lobsters plus sides for just $26! They have lunch prices available as well as happy hour between 3-6 PM for cheaper appetizers. The menu has quite the variety ranging from baked seafood, fried seafood, steamed seafood, assorted soups, and many more options! 

We wanted to try several different things so we went with a cup of corn and crab chowder, a cup of clam chowder, and the sampler ($13.99) which included fried shrimp, haddock nuggets, fries and a clam cake. I definitely preferred the corn and crab chowder over the clam chowder as it wasn't as heavy. Both soups had a lot of potato chunks in them so just a heads up whether or not you like potatoes in your soups. The haddock nuggets were the best surprise of the meal as the breading and fish itself were really well made. The clam cake was a little underwhelming as it didn't really taste like seafood. 

The food came out quick and received a good amount of food for the price. You can also buy live lobsters with a really good deal of 5 lobsters for just 30 bucks. They also sell other types of raw seafood that you can purchase which is located right next to the actual restaurant counter. Next time I am in the area I plan on trying the fried scallops and getting some more haddock nuggets!"
1368,"I love Maine lobsters. 
2 lobsters with fries is $26. Fresh.
Very good deal.
It came very quickly! Outside seats are nice but be careful for mosquitoes for people who attract them."
1369,"Me and my friends drove from Boston for a short vacation and visited this fast casual restaurant for dinner, we ordered a bunch of food including twin lobsters, bake seafood, steamed clam and mussels, crab melts(crab meat sandwich with cheese), mac and cheese, oysters, a slice of blueberry pie, clam chowder, and extra corn on the cob. 

Price - was a bit cheaper than the others

The steamed seafood here was fresh as well as the other restaurants, I'm not a big lobster fan but my friends loved it. 

Crab melt - a bit salty with cheap cheese

Oysters were small for almost $3 each. 

Clam chowder and pie was good.

Slaw was good.

Mac and Cheese - very disappointing, I know exactly it was Kraft mac and cheese.

Bake medley seafoods - was reasonable with amount of seafood given in the dish, I'm not sure if it should be sweet. It could be naturally sweet from the ingredients but would be much much better if it's just a bit more savory salty ""FOR ME"".

Corn on the cob - sweet

One thing that I was just a little upset was about the service. We got there 30 minuets before they close. We asked if it's okay to eat in the restaurant. They said yes. So, we ordered and got our foods around the closing time. After we got the food and eating for 20 mins, they turn off the light. We're just rushing to finish everything.

Make sure you plan to get here at least 1 hr before they close, so that you have time to enjoy your food."
1370,"Had to visit Docks after seeing Andrew Zimmerman's piece on Portland.   The Finnen Haddie was really good. Big pieces of smoked fish. Local place where you order at the counter and they call your number.  Nothing fancy but good fresh food cooked to order.  
The photo has a crab cake a clam cake the lobster roll and the finnen haddie.   I'll take Andrews advice for future food visits."
1371,"My wife and I are visiting family.  Tonight was our last night so we went on Yelp to look for some good Seafood in the Portland area.  Docks was only 2 miles from our hotel and had good reviews.  My wife said after looking at the menu and how the service ran: ""This the the Five Guys of seafood"".  A very good description!  We ordered a one lobster meal (my first of eating a whole lobster, haddock meal, and large fried shrimp (quart).  All the food was amazing!  We would have loved to sample more of the menu but that was all we could eat!  When we visit family again in Portland we are coming back.  We highly recommend this restaurant!"
1372,"Definitely recommend Dock's for some lobster. The food was priced really well and was delicious. 

PROs:
- Fresh lobsters (lobster tank is in the restaurant and you can see the chefs grabbing the lobsters as folks order)
- Friendly staff
- french fries are fresh
- plenty of space in the place for a family to eat
- lobster rolls had an abundance of lobster
- menu has an abundance of seafood options

CONs:
- lobster bisque was good but was exactly the stuff I buy at the grocery store.. was hoping for something homemade

Overall, this is a must try place for me."
1373,"Enjoyed the lobster dinner.  The Crab cakes were ""okay.""  Definitely ""order up"" to get the sweet potato fries.  You order at counter and they call your number when it is ready. Very informal with comfortable seating inside and tables outside.    Easy parking.  Nice staff."
1374,"This place was pretty nice. We ordered the two lobster dinner and shared it. Only $26 for two cooked lobsters. You order at the counter and they call your number so pretty informal. They are very quick, so it is a nice quick stop on the way back to Boston from hiking. 

I haven't gone for Maine lobster too many times yet. One thing I noticed about the lobster I got was that the claws and the tail fins weren't completely full of meat like the one I had this Spring outside of Acadia. I wonder why that is and if maybe the lobster had been kept in a tank for a long time after being caught."
1375,"Big menu- picked up some takeout at the end of a long Friday of travel.  Lobster roll meal special came to $20+ and came right out. Lots of folks ordering out for supper and staff seemed to keep things moving right along. Lunch menu looked particularly interesting- would try that on a future visit. Several folks were ordering in and seemed happy :)

Fries were particularly good- a sign of clean oil which promises good things for the haddock nuggets next time :) Slaw was simple and an ice counterpoint to the large and tasty lobster roll.  Lightly seasoned, filling the split top bun, a solid version of the classic.

Good outpost to save a trip to downtown!"
1376,"Affordable! We got the crab chowder and lobster roll combo, both so good! Only regret is not getting a bigger lobster roll because it was so good."
1377,"This was my third time here and the food is consistent, each time we go the service is welcoming and friendly, it's got a nice casual atmosphere and it makes this place a good spot for lunch. The food isn't going to blow you away but it will provide a good meal consistently..."
1378,"This place was yummy! I had the lobster and corn on the cob, and my boyfriend had the fried scallops and haddock. Everything was simple and tasty. The place feels very local - not at all touristy."
1379,"Fun for the whole family, we found this place on our honeymoon, and enjoyed our lobster and crab. A few years later we celebrated another anniversary there with lobster and crab. Great prices, great food, clean restaurant, and the seafood is fresh"
1380,"We wanted one more lobster meal in Maine before driving back home to Boston. Randomly decided to give this local, non-touristy place a try, and we left seafood-wasted, in a good way.

Recommend ordering:
1. Steamed LOBSTERS (1.25 pounds each): twins plus sides for just $25. The lobster meat was perfectly cooked and fresh. Just look at my picture of the sexy nude lobster tail - basically porn for lobster fans, I know.
2. STEAMERS: happy hour special $6 for a pound. I call these ""magic steamers."" So good, they will just disappear in front of your eyes (and into your belly).
3. COCONUT SHRIMP: well-seasoned and not greasy.

The other items were good too but would probably skip next time: fried shrimp (turned out to be popcorn shrimp and not butterflied *sad face*), fried whole belly clams (fresh but heavy batter), mussels (on the small side), and blueberry pie (served cold, with a very doughy crust).

Generous amounts of melted butter with your plates but...wish they provided bibs.
Counter-service was brusque but...they did give us a free order of fries since they messed up our side order. 
Interior was no frills but...clean with spacious tables. 
Picnic table seating available in the free parking lot space but...beware of debris getting into your food.
Lobster tank on-site but...not smelly at all."
1381,"Best lobster roll around (and the BLT lobster roll special is also delicious when available). Local place. Always packed. To get a table inside you usually need to wait and then pounce on it as soon as it opens up, whoever grabs it first gets the table. They also do takeout. High quality at a low price - can be hectic, but that's part of the charm!"
1382,"We hit town on a Saturday night and the joint was jumping.  It's family style, casual and obviously popular with the locals (always a good sign).

You order and pay first, then take a seat til they call your number and you carry your tray of incredible seafood.  The lobster roll was great as were the chowders, but their menu is immense and they have a huge take-out business.

Nothing fancy about this place... except the amazing food."
1383,Very average. Roadside local restaurant. Read menu from sign and proceed to counter and order. You're given a number and they call over s loudspeaker when ready. Kinda dirty. No one was wiping tables. Do not recommend.
1384,"Best fried clams I've ever had! Generous pint! Twin lobsters, yum. Friendly staff, see you next trip!"
1385,"Good, cheap, eats. No frills, no fuss. I'd give it more stars if you could get a beer or a glass of wine with dinner...no bar. Sitting outside was nice!"
1386,"This place was so good that I came here twice on my stay in Portland.

Twin lobster dinner was delicious.  Fries were especially good.  Lobsters are very fresh.  You can walk over and see the live lobster tanks in the back of the restaurant.  Spoke with Bob, the owner, while in the first day.  He explained to me the process involved in taking live lobster back with me.  He was a very nice person to talk to.  Came back the next day to get my lobster to fly back to DC with me.  Bob was there again to help me out.  He packed up my lobsters and clams in a travel box for me and had them ready while we had another lobster before we left Portland to head back to DC.

Great place to come for a twin lobster dinner outside of the downtown Portland area.  Prices are better here also.  Try the fried dough, its really delicious."
1387,"A+. Really a great seafood experience. The menu is huge they have everything in the sea you might be craving. The clam chowder was top notch, I do love me some chowda. I had the steamed lobster, it was fresh and delicious. I wish places like this existed in Pennsylvania because I would come here religiously. Will definitely stop by again if/when we are back in the area."
1388,"Best lobster I've had in my entire life. We came in from nyc day of and ordered the special 2 lobster and one side I believe and one lobster 2 sides. So it was 5 whole lobster all day in addition to the other sides like fried calamari, fried oysters, lobster mac and cheese, sweet potatoe fries, whole corn and lobster bisque. Hmmm really hard to mess up sweet potatoe fries and corn and I've had all those sides better at various places in nyc so I wasn't impressed but the lobster the whole lobster fucking fantastic. This place gets five stars just for the lobster alone. Well now that I wrote and proofread what I wrote they get a 4 star rating sides weren't impressive and there is imperfection but other than that this is the best lobster I've had ever highly recommend this place for lobster"
1389,"Went here for our visit in Maine. Kind of a dirty place?
First of all it took FOREVER.. My friend ordered a lobster roll-wasnt great, had very dry bread- 
and for me the chicken alfredo, which was super watery and wasnt good at all. 
When our food was ordered we received everything but the chicken alfredo, which came out 15 minutes after! 
Spend the extra buck and go to Dimillos on the water!"
1390,"Definitely i recommend. Familly owned..!!
Good Quality, fair price .... fried oysters not crispy enough... but it us not major..."
1391,"We have been to this place a few different times and have enjoyed eating there each time. The food is more traditional with items such as steamed lobsters, lobster rolls, fried scallops, and clam strips. The prices are reasonable for what you get. If you are looking for a low key place to go, give this place a shot."
1392,"Horrible food, horrible customer service. We ordered lobster rolls, clam chowder, coleslaw and fries. The best part of our meal was the fries. My boyfriend almost broke his tooth biting into the lobster roll as their was a lobster shell in it. The lobster meat was dressed in mayo, and it looked like it had been sitting a while as the mayo had started to get gelatinous. The coleslaw had no flavor and the clam chowder had barely any clams in it. The person at the front counter was very rude as well. We ordered two side orders of ranch to go with our fries and when we went to the front counter we didn't get any. We then asked for our ranch and she only gave us one. When we asked for another ranch she made a snarky remark and basically threw it at our tray. We will not be returning to this restaurant as their are too many wonderful places to get lobster rolls around the Portland area."
1393,The wife and I stopped in while traveling in Maine (gotta have lobster). The place does a booming business and seating (seat yourself) is limited but the food is top notch. I had the lobster roll and she had the lobster.  Very tasty
1394,Was looking for a restaurant locals would frequent. Nailed it. Only two cars in the lot with out of state tags. Tried the Finnon Haddie (smoked haddock in a cream sauce with hard boiled eggs). Throughly enjoyed it (although my spouse wasn't thrilled). Very busy on Saturday night. Indoor and outdoor seating. Near local light house. Looked like a great place for lobster and mussels.
1395,"Another great meal at Docks tonight. It's not on the water, not downtown, or fancy on the inside. I like fish, and this is at the top of my list. No problem getting there, no problem parking the cah. One of the last of Maine restaurants with Finnan Haddie on the menu. Finnan Haddie is smoked haddock in cream sauce that is off the chart good on buttered toast. The crab cakes had lots of crab in them.The calamari was downright addictive."
1396,"It's nice to see an awesome restaurant like this one at this location. It's been here for at least 6 years now I think. The food is usually great and they do have a lot of seating. I always see the owners and everyone that works here is super friendly. They do peak during certain times (especially dinner during the summer) and so the wait/line can be a tad long. But I've never had a problem during lunch. But it's always worth it. Food, price, parking and seating are great pluses. I typically get their lobster rolls (sometimes they toast the bread, but I usually have to ask) or haddock dinner plate. I'm not a huge fan of their fries so I skip that. Overall a good relaxed lunch or dinner out spot at great prices."
1397,The food wasn't anything different compared to any other place insignificant. The service was nice and polite
1398,"Decided to have lunch at Docks Seafood and ordered the Lobster B.L.T. which was delicious, the crispy smokey bacon enhanced the flavor of the lobster. 
 I also ordered the clam strip lunch and haddock nuggets and shrimp special with fries and slaw also great and the prices were very readonable.
Overall experience was great and also good service definitely coming back."
1399,"Went with my family for the first time today. My mom and aunt had scallops that they both said that they were the sweetest that they had ever had. Mom said that she didn't even need tartar sauce. My brother, who is allergic to fish, was very happy with his steak and cheese sandwich. I had the haddock Reuben, which was very good. I loved the crinkle cut sweet potato fries, which stayed  crisp and hot until they were gone. Would definitely like to come back!"
1400,"I was in Maine for a weekend and a Maine lobster roll was number one on my list of things to try. This place was recommended to me by a friend who is from Maine. I really enjoyed their lobster roll. It was tasty and fresh. They weren't cheap with how much lobster meat they serve you. Cost was about $20, which seemed like average for lobster rolls. The second time I went there I ordered the fries clams, which was decent. I'll recommend this place if you are in Maine and looking for a good lobster roll."
1401,"This is a great place to stop in. The lobster was good. The chowder was really good. The service was ok, but it's not like it's a 5 Star restaurant so it's as expected. It's an unassuming place but you will not be disappointed. Stop in, the folks are friendly and the food is really good"
1402,"Interesting location, liked the outside eating area. However the lobster was a little disapointing, wasnt fully cooked, the claws had almost no meat in them, and were way over priced for what we received. The fried clam strips were good but the tartar sauce tasted like it was purchased at the grocery store. In other words it had to much relish. Over all, I wouldnt go out of my way to come here and eat. I had two full lobsters which did not fill me up."
1403,"Fantastic experience with great lobster with a fun setting.  Great service and and all around great experience.  Nicest people and staff.  I believe wanted a beer with my lobster and while they don't sell it, they send me across the street for it and let me bring it back.  I love that and thank you!  Everything was top notch and I couldn't have imagined anything better.  Nice fair prices, heck...a bargain.   Get the two lobster dinner.   What else could you want?  5 stars!"
1404,"Recently had a trip to Maine,  my first time to Docks, Family highly recommended this place. I got the crab roll, it was a nice fat crab roll was so delicious. My friend got a fried Haddock sandwich, she gave me a piece of the haddock - delicious! Very comfortable inside, picnic tables outside. I will be back on my next trip to Maine."
1405,"Great service and food at a great price. Single lobster dinner with a baked potato was only $18. Also had a cup of clam chowder that was on point. If you're looking for a fancy or somewhere with hip modern decor, look further for some tourist trap. If you want to eat good seafood with the locals in a low key environment, this is your spot."
1406,"This is probably one of my favorite place to go for fried oysters or calamari and lobsters nearby Portland. There are plenty of spaces for parking unlike mamy resturants in Old port and the staff are friendly! I was trying to look for resturants where they serve lobsters with reasonable price to bring family and friends when they come for a visit, and I think I have found my resturant! 
I came here with couple of friends who were visiting and they loved it also! The portion is pretty big and you will be satisfied with your food! The cole slaw isnt bad at all and the calamari was really delicious!"
1407,The Lobster Roll was on a small hot dog bun and the lobster meat had no flavor.  There are better $17 lobster rolls to be had.
1408,This place  has great seafood at a good price fast service   I love it  reminds me of  the  old  captain  newicks
1409,These whole belly clams are Amazn.. I mean Amazn..got. The luncheon whole belly clams and misses got the sampler.. Can't go wrong. But next time I will bypass the fries and just get the pint of whole belly clams and feast...
1410,"I've never left a review on yelp before but feel like I should because of how overpriced this food was for the quality received. The lobsters were much smaller than expected and filled with so much water I poured probably a cup off of my plate and onto the ground. The crab and clam cakes were disks of disappointment. They were just flat disks of mystery filler. My niece ordered $5 Mac and cheese which turned out to be a small portion of kraft, which would cost about 25 cents to make. My clam chowder arrived cold, as if it had been pulled out of the refrigerator and never heated. It was comparable to Campbell's clam chowder that had been stored in a refrigerator. The roll that came with my meal was hard, dry, and crusty. The clam strips and fries were average. Everything else was beyond disappointing. The only positive aspect was that the staff was decently friendly. Would not return."
1411,"We love eating here as we always feel like everyone else is a ""local""! Friendly service and very fairly priced. Excellent over stuffed ""lobsta"" rolls, seriously good chowder in a variety of styles and a huge selection of fish dishes. I had the baked, stuffed haddock and it was rich, but excellent. Cole slaw was passable and we skipped the Mac and Cheese when we were advised that it was the Kraft box stuff. Excellent fries and fried onion rings. One downside is the all plastic serviceware, but it's more than offset by their no charge BYOB policy....the chance to eat delicious fresh lobster and that baked Haddock with Champagne was heavenly. Large portions so bring your appetite. We'll be back again, as we have many times before."
1412,"I'm not embarrassed to say that we came here twice in a span of 3 days and it's definitely a local spot (as confirmed by some locals who we shared a table with). 

The first night, we wanted to eat something besides lobster, so we had the fried shrimp dinner and the steamers. The fried shrimp dinner came with an abundance of shrimp and fries and the shrimp were amazing cooked just right, so tender, not at all over done and not over-battered. The steamers were more no frills than fancy restaurants that serve steamers, but delicious and a steal at the happy hour appetizer price for one pound! The clam chowder wasn't my favorite for the trip. It's very thick, but has less flavor than all of the other restaurants we tried. 

The second night, we decided to come back here for the twin lobster special which was a much better bargain than anywhere else in the area. The lobster was so sweet and delicious. The corn on the cob was nothing to write home about. Fries were delicious. If you're feeling hungry, you should order something else plus this twin lobster special (maybe some more steamers ;) ? ) 

During busy times, you might have to wait half an hour for your food, but it's worth it! This local gem is falls in-between the no frills/very bare bones type of establishment and your normal restaurant and I think that's adequately reflected in the price. It's casual, delicious, and of great value. Plus, there's a parking lot!"
1413,"I had such high hopes ..... it was just ok but maybe I was expecting the same sweet succulent lobster I have had in Maine all the other times .the stuffed lobster is dry and the crab stuffing is bread we dug through the  whole thing . 
Also the older lady at the counter whom I believe is either the owner or manger is NOT a people person . 
I don't understand why I had to fight her to skip the baked potato and corn and PAY for a salad ??? Then she was put out because I told her "" we wanted to order what we could eat and we would pay for it "" 
I didn't think the price was bad 53 bucks and change but the lobster was just ok  . I have had better lobster on a cruise ship . 

The young lady is super friendly I kinda felt bad for her . The place is crawling with locals but they are eating something fried . Maybe that's the ticket ? Eat fried stuff"
1414,"Great Food !!  Location is ok, parking is great.   I never got a bad meal, and I am always leaving happy.   Great place for seafood.  Love it !"
1415,"We had lobster roll small but stuffed and tasty. I got clam plate very tasty clams with French fries. The plate was on smaller side but the clams were very very good whole belly on the medium Size bellies with excellent ocean taste. Overall good meal wait time is on slow side. 

You enter restaurant not knowing where to go or order. Big menu on side of wall. You go to register pay  then wait at a table they'll  call out your order. They have outside picnic tables and tables on the inside.  1 lobster roll, 1 clam plate 1 Soda $39.60."
1416,"ordered the lobster bisque and then the scallops lunch plate. 
bisque was perfect in flavor . didn't have lobster chunks . I thought it would  . the scallops were fresh that I could taste the sand   anyways . another place that compares to this restaurant is in wells , me  the fisherman's catch . I will definitely eat here again when on Maine again  . love the family owned theme ."
1417,We were looking for a place where we could get good fresh lobster with no frills and we found it. The lobster was amazing and the price was right.
1418,"Been here a few times with the family. The people are always nice and the food is great. this time around we ordered to-go... The fried shrimp is a must have! the haddock nuggets were OK but nothing to write home about.. and the clam bellies were great. We ordered corn on the cob and it was SO good. they package up all the fixings too which is great for when you're staying at a hotel and want cocktail sauce! Definitely stop in to this place, if you eat in and the kids go over to the lobster tanks, a staff member will take one out to show the kids.. it's cool! =)"
1419,"3 years later and this place is even better than I remembered it being! You just cannot beat the prices here. Hands down, I'd choose this place over any restaurant on commercial street. Twin lobster meal for $22.99 which comes with a side and cole slaw. They cook the lobsters to order which is why the wait is usually 20 minutes upon ordering. This place seems to have garnered popularity over the years, but the prices remain unchanged. The clam chowder is also so good. 

You will leave this place feeling full and satisfied. Go here! your wallet will thank you for it."
1420,Docks never disappoints me. Having the cup of seafood chowder and half a crab roll. Reasonable prices and good food. You supply the good company.
1421,"Went on a Yelp review.  
We arrived at 4:30.  No one in the place.  Cute dinning room.  Nice casual atmosphere.  We ordered the twin lobster dinner specials.  I did fine the tail a bit chewy.  The butter needed salt.  Overwhelmed by the amount of water the Lobster had.  The calamari dinner was dry.  I should have sent it back.  The crab cakes were good.  The steamers were good, but the mussels were not.  I was disappointed! Was really looking forward to a good dinner with the kids.  Fell short in my book !"
1422,Wonderful! $11.99 haddock nuggets and fried shrimp with fries. My husband and I each had a huge plate of haddock and shrimp. Everything was cooked to perfection. Lunch was fantastic. We would absolutely recommend this place. Nothing fancy just good seafood. The restroom was nice and clean too.
1423,"On the way back from visiting Portland head lighthouse, we stopped here for lunch.  We ordered pasta with red sauce, clam chowder, lobster roll, crab roll, and the haddock dinner, and of course, the Maine blueberry pie.  Its a very casual dining establishment, and you can tell, there were a good number of locals and tourist visiting.  I tried everything we ordered, except for the pasta with red sauce.  The kids finished all the pasta and seemed to enjoyed it.  What really made this place stand out were the people working there.  The food is good, but it is not outstanding, and the price is fair for the quality and the amount of food you get.  
The lady behind the counter was very friendly, took my kids to the lobster tank and showed them the live lobsters and even let them hold it (with the claws rubber banded, of course).  Another older gentleman who also work there later also struck a conversation with my kids when they were lingering around the lobster tank and told them about some interesting facts as well as where the lobsters were headed (they were shipping them to another state).  
Overall, it was a nice lunch break and would definitely visit again if I'm in the area."
1424,"Dinner at Docks was repulsive.  My birthday, celebrating with steamers and lobsters.  Disgusting and a major health risk.  Expensive and irresponsible owners.  Steamers were supposed to be cleaned and steamed...they arrived to us floating in dirty broth, mud, and grit.  Lobsters were smaller than promised. Meat was tough and tasteless.  Fresh corn, a joke.  I'm a native, have eaten fresh seafood since the age of 2.  Also, a chef and food critic.  The only thing I would eat again at Docks is dessert, on a good day.  Wasted a hundred dollars and my birthday meal.  This is a total rip off.  Never again.  Shame on you Docks."
1425,"Lobster roll wasnt bad, but wasnt good either. Probably my fault cuz i didnt ask for the lettuce, onions, etc that apparently come on it (i read the menu after i ate). The front end people seem like they lack soft skills but are efficient and know the menu.  

Lobster nuggets were almost inedible as the chewiness was close to rubber.  

Haddock nuggets were good and the fries were the best part.

Also, drinks are overpriced 20oz bottles of soda."
1426,"THE LOCATION
This family friendly local favorite located in South Portland at the intersection of Evans Street and Broadway is just a short 4-1/2 mile car ride from Portland Jetport. 

THE PARKING
Ample lot parking is available on this spacious corner property. 

THE ATMOSPHERE
Brightly lit and sparse, this restaurant is a casual diner-type of eatery with a large, easy-to-read wall menu board to the right of the entrance and cheerful staff waiting to take your order at the counter. There is plenty of roomy seating in the adjacent dine-in area. On this occasion, it was at an off peak hour so we pretty much had the restaurant to ourselves. 

THE FOOD
As the last two meals of our New England adventure, we were thrilled to enjoy such deliciously fresh seafood in the quiet comfort of our vacation rental on our final day before our return home. Everything was wonderfully tasty and we were more than satisfied with the portions received for our take-out lunch and dinner.

---Twin 1.25# Lobster Dinner w/ corn-on-the-cob, coleslaw $25.99---

---Lobster Roll $12.99---

---Slice of Maine Blueberry Pie $2.50---

---Lunch-sized Fried Clam w/ onion rings, coleslaw $12.99---

---Bowl of Corn Crab Chowder $9.99---

THE SERVICE 
We were met with excellent and efficient service as the folks behind the counter were warm, hospitable and inviting. Since we were ordering take-out, they made sure we were well stocked with utensils and napkins, and even offered to crack our lobster just in case we didn't have the proper tools. They made sure to double check our order just to insure that everything was in the bag before we left."
1427,"Loved feeling like a local at this place, everyone was so kind and welcoming! Large menu and good prices for the fresh seafood. We ordered lobster rolls, sweet potato fries, crab cakes, fried pickles and it was all delicious!"
1428,"Had the lobster roll it was very good but.kind of small, I had to ask to toast a roll on a lobster roll I thought it would come that way.
French fries were okay not the way I like him though"
1429,"Tasteless fried food, no flavor whatsoever. lobster was only so-so. Coleslaw was like the fried food. How do you mess up coleslaw?"
1430,"Great little spot before we hit up the Sea Dogs. What's not to like about this place? It's everything you want in a casual seafood place. Great atmosphere, quick service, decent prices, and outstanding food. The lobster roll was fresh with no fillers and overflowing with delicious lobster. Clam strips were perfectly fried and tasty. Corn on the cob to end the meal really hit the spot! 

Overall: perfect casual spot to get great seafood outside of downtown Portland!"
1431,"Nice little find here. Off the beaten tourist path but a good place to get a HUGE seafood meal. The lunch plates, available also at supper, are large. If you leave hungry then it's your fault. I enjoyed the sampler which had fried shrimp, fried haddock nuggets and a clam cake. This is served with fries and slaw. The fried pickles are also good."
1432,"Excellent New England style seafood with wonderful/friendly service!  

Also got fresh lobsters and steamers (clams) from here at a great price!

Will always stop in when we visit... It's a local South Maine MUST try!!!"
1433,"Been driving by this place for a couple of months and finally stopped in for a lobster roll.  Ordering at the counter was a little confusing your first time.  Didn't take long and I had a roll, coleslaw and fries.
Lobster meat was fresh but had no dressing, either butter or mayo, and came on a cold hot dog roll.  They should ask when you order what your preferences are.  And not grilled!!!  Really?  A cold hot dog bun for a 12$ sandwich?  That you have to ask for generic mayo for?  Coleslaw was also fresh but bland.  Fries were also fresh and cooked perfectly.
Tarter sauce was abundant but made with sweet pickles.  Yuck.  When you are looking for a lobster roll in Maine you should get the real deal.
Ok meal but won't be back."
1434,"We were looking for an ""order at the counter"" quick place. This was the place. Haddock chowder--a lot of haddock;flavor good.  Received a baked potato rather than French fries; no flavor to the Cole slaw.  Grilled haddock was very fresh. Nice portion but think it was broiled not grilled. Twin lobsters good.  Would probably give a higher rating if we didn't wait 55 minutes for our food."
1435,"A decent place to come and eat. We were in Portland for a family vacation and was looking for a good seafood place with decent price and was glad we found here. 

Very surprised they close so early at 8pm. We ordered the twin lobsters with Cole slaw and french fries and a order of their mussels. Food took a while to come out. And the lobsters was a lot smaller than I expected. But at $25 for 2 lobsters I guess I can't complaint. The lobsters were a bit overcooked and hard to chew. But you can taste that it was very fresh. Nothing too special with the mussels. It was just regular steam mussels served with butter sauce. 

Self service.  You order the food at the counter and pick your own table to sit. Place was very clean. And people working there was very friendly 

Overall a solid and decent place if you are in the area"
1436,"Not my favorite place to go for fried seafood, they tend to over cook their food. Whole belly claims are always a disappointment. It's too bad because we live so close and I had high hopes."
1437,"Great food! Simply delicious! My wife and I got the fried clams, double lobster entrees, and lobster stew. Everything tasted very fresh and clean. If you're looking for just good food and don't care about fine dining service. Go to Docks Seafood for awesome seafood."
1438,"Great value! Seafood chowder with 1/2 lobster roll- lobster roll was small and under whelming - nothing special / the seafood chowder was loaded with a fish and some shrimp and scallops- it was quite good $9.99. I think would just get the bowl of chowder instead.  Combination pick 2 $17.99 - scallops and wholebelly clam w/ fries- scallops and fries were amazing, whole belly clams wasn't in season so they were small and tasted just like clam strips. Shrimp w/ fries $6.99 - descent amount of shrimp but have no flavor- it was so so."
1439,"Good service and reasonable prices. The lobster roll was enjoyable - the lobster meat was fresh and not too dressed. The fried oyster plate was a bit small (too many fries, to few oysters). The lobster stew was extremely disappointing - it consisted of pieces of lobster (albeit a good amount) in barely warm milk/cream. After we fished the lobster out, we could not drink the rest of the stew."
1440,Excellent fresh seafood. Even the produce (lettuce & tomato) is super fresh. The fish was swimming last night! Nice cold water for free. The fries are fresh cut. Bring your own booze.
1441,Drove all the way to Maine from NYC just to get a taste of the fresh lobster that everyone is talking about. This place is no doubt one of the best seafood restaurants I've been to in this area. The waiters were friendly and I can tell these people care about what they do. One thing I do have to complain about is all the bugs outside by the seating area.. but that's out of our control right? I'll definitely be coming back here again. This restaurant speaks for what real seafood is.
1442,I grew up in this neighborhood.  Of course back then they didn't have this restaurant.  All I can tell you is the food is great.  Definitely not your white tablecloth high-end place but if you just want really good seafood this is where you need to come.  My test is always would I go back.  We're only on vacation for a week and a half and I've been there three times already.  Kind of says it all.
1443,Awesome!! The lobster quesadilla was amazing! The sweet potato fries were a great side. Prices are very reasonable. Quick and not too crowded on a Saturday afternoon
1444,"Docks Seafood is a neighborhood seafood restaurant full of local regulars. We were in Portland for the first time and asked the hotel front desk lady for recommendations of a seafood restaurant in Portland.  We are so glad that she mentioned Docks Seafood. Docks' seafood chowder was extremely fresh and tasty and steamed lobster was so good, plus the prices are reasonable. The lady at the counter was very friendly and easy going. Definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back for more good food."
1445,"Get the twin lobster meal, best deal. Don't know about the other stuff, but I can vouch the lobster and steamed clams are good."
1446,Stopped here for a quick lunch on our way into Portland for the weekend and we were so glad that we did! Casual and nothing fancy but Hefty portions of delicious seafood! They don't skimp on their lobster roll!
1447,"A nice casual seafood shack south of Portland. They have a big menu posted at the front and you order at the counter. While the hours weren't the best (I believe they close at 8), they were open during the winter which is what we cared about. 

Prices were ok, with the twin lobster special around $27. The lobsters were normal size (around 1-1.25 pounds), very fresh and well cooked. The clam strips were very good, as was the clam chowder (may have been a bit heavy on the potato)."
1448,"Fresh sea food, clean restaurant, but small portions, and a rather surly staff. There are too many other places to get some clams and a lobster roll around here to be this grumpy to your customers. We came in right around opening and a woman who I can only assume is the owner stood next to the cashier and glowered at us the whole time. Bad day? Maybe. RBF? Definitely. In the wrong business for either? Seemingly."
1449,"I'm only in Maine for one night, so I was determined to spend it well, preferably with a lobster.  A quick yelp search brought up this spot, just a ten minute drive from my hotel, and the ratings were high, so I decided to check it out.

Since January isn't exactly peak season, I was worried there might not be much of a fresh selection, but thankfully, I was wrong.  After quickly scanning the menu board, I chose the lobster dinner, a steamed lobster served with fries and coleslaw for $13.95.  Had I known how darn cheap the ""market price"" was going to be, I would have ordered the double!! Alas, I went with the single, and enjoyed every bite.  I asked for it to be cracked, and the chef actually kindly cleaned it for me, leaving just the tail in the shell, which made for pleasant, easy eating.

Docks has an easy-going, laid-back feel. The staff was super friendly and welcoming.  You order and pay at the counter, then find yourself a seat at a plastic-topped tables.  Lobsters await their saunas in a tank by some of the tables, which assures freshness and entertains the kids.  There didn't appear to be a ton of seating, though I suppose during warmer months you can eat outside.  There are newspapers for those who are passing time waiting for take-out, which also makes this a friendly place for single diners. 

If I'm ever back in the South Portland area, you can bet I'll be stopping at Docks!"
1450,Well the chowder seemed Campbells and the mac and cheese was Kraft.  The clam strip were ok. I really should stick with my rule not to eat at a restaurant that has mostly fried food on the menu. Shame because we like to buy in South Portland.
1451,"The lobster and fried clam strips are awesome! Fair prices too. You just order at the counter and find a seat. You can also look at all the live lobsters in the back. Great food, no frills."
1452,"Saw good reviews, so decided to give the place a try.  Haddock was not bad but Scallops were dry without much taste.... Can not recommend based on the quality of the food."
1453,"My first lobster roll and it was great,  chowder was good.  I'm from Louisiana so I know and love fresh seafood and this was very good.  Will stop in again when we come back."
1454,"Really enjoyed dining at David's Restaurant. We came to Portland for a Valentine's Day weekend trip, and saw this place had great reviews. Make a reservation if you can - we could only get 5pm, but it was worth it! 

Tried the special ""Cupid's Gimlet"" cocktail - cucumber infused gin with muddled strawberry and club soda, very tasty. For dinner we both got the lobster dinner (when in Maine right?). For $38 marketprice we got the lobster, garlic mashed potatoes, clam chowder and blackened shrimp. We enjoyed every bite! If you're not interested in getting lobster here, I'd definitely recommend the chowder or shrimp as an appetizer alone. For dessert, we shared the chocolate raspberry cheesecake, which was del

All in all, a cozy and cute restaurant and a worthwhile visit while in Portland!"
1455,"Maine restaurant week is always an exciting time for me.  An opportunity to try out some new places.  One of the places I tried this year was David's.
We reserved on a Friday night and when we got there, the place was buzzing!  Even so, the staff was accommodating and lovely.  
At first glance, the regular menu looked so intriguing, I considered abandoning the ""special"" menu, but then flip flopped my way back to the three course RW menu.
I started with a chicken apple sausage, served with a spicy slaw app, chose a hake and peekytoe crab main course, and, with the advice of my server, settled on Maine blueberry crisp for dessert.
My sausage appetizer was fantastic. I will only eat sausage if it is sold/served to me by the person who made it.  While I did not meet the chef directly, the sausage is made in house.  It was expertly spiced and served atop a french onion aioli.
My hake main course was equally delicious.  A generous serving of fish and crab, served over butternut squash risotto.  My dinner companion picked the meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes, and loved everything about it.
The blueberry crisp dessert was wonderful.  Warm, Maine blueberries with a crunchy oat and nut topping.  Also, a generous serving.  As I am limited on how much dessert I can eat, I had a VERY hard time handing most of this dish back to my server!
I am giving David's 4 instead of 5 stars only because of cramped seating.  I absolutely understand it was a special night, but we were somewhat trapped in by the tables around us.  Everyone was packed into everyone else's grill, it did not feel like private conversation was possible at the table.
Other than that, I will most definitely return!
I've lived in Portland for 27 years, and have absolutely no excuse for not checking out David's sooner!"
1456,"You will not be disappointed when you go to David's in Monument Square. It was a party of eight of us and we could not of had better service... When I ordered my martini with 3 1/2 olives , Our server smiled and delivered what I had ordered. Everybody exclaimed over there Meil from salmon, steak perfectly cooked, duck and even the Caesar salad. The garlic knots"
1457,We only had the pleasure to enjoy the HH menu and even that was delicious. The dishes had complexity and a lot of flavor. The shrimp dish and the beef tartare were exquisite. This place is a much try.
1458,"David's is a great little find literally and figuratively in Portland.

We made a Friday night reservation at David's, which was walking distance from our hotel. On our way inside, we walked past a little outdoor seating area. The restaurant had a small bar and the tables were sitting in close proximity to the kitchen, close enough that the fumes and smoke overwhelmed the place. They opened the door to create a more welcoming environment.

Our server was very pleasant and as we inquired about several appetizers that caught our eye, she made sure that we were on the right track. We started with the crispy potstickers with Asian beef and the parmesan and herb tater tots. The tater tots were not what we were anticipating...in a good way. They were huge crispy potatoes with a honeyed goat cheese and mango ketchup for dipping. The potstickers were also very good.

Given that we were in Maine, I wanted lobster. I got their most popular dish - the open faced lobster ravioli. It was more of a seafood pasta dish with lobster, scallops, and shrimp. The portion was decent for the price. He ordered David's meatloaf with crispy cumin onions. A daily specials menu had several items that looked quite good.

We enjoyed our meal at David's and the atmosphere was perfect for a quiet, romantic meal."
1459,"The menu at David's looked good so my wife and I gave it a try on a Friday night in August. 

The space is very active...with an open kitchen, bar and two distinct dining areas.

Service was a bit frantic, definitely not smooth, although we were never left along too long.

As for the food - presentation was nice on all dishes however, they fell short of spectacular. Pea tendril and watermelon avocado salad sounded better than it tasted...not bad just a bit flat, maybe under-seasoned. My filet mignon with blue cheese and purple potatoes was ok, but the cut could have been better..... also, my original choice, the filet special, was already no longer available at 7 o'clock on a Friday night. My wife's open faced lobster and scallops ravioli was the best of the bunch.
There are too many other better restaurants in the area to come back."
1460,"The space is great, the free garlic knots are THE BOMB, and we had really friendly service. I had the duck, which was delicious. Would recommend!"
1461,"I don't think I'm the target customer.

I came in here for lunch last week to celebrate a coworker. It is small in here, but cozy and beautifully decorated.
Our server was awesome. He was courteous and helpful.

I'm sorry to be a meanie, BUT this is why I say I'm not the target customer.
- It's really expensive. Like, it's clearly for people that are not ratchet 26 year old locals that can barely afford their own apartment.
- The serving sizes are teeeeeny. I understand that in America we are obsessed with unhealthily large servings, but for the whack prices, you'd expect more.
- The taste of the dish I had was disappointing. I'd looked at the menu online before heading over for lunch and decided on the Exotic Mushroom Ravioli, which includes ricotta, mushrooms, leeks, shallots, arugula, tomato, sauce, goat cheese, parmesan and truffle oil. At lunch this was $16; at dinner it's $26. Yikes. It was more like a soup. The two dollops of ricotta were sort of plopped in the soup. The mushrooms seemed scarce for being a mushroom dish. There were four or five raviolis in the soupy dish. I'd say the best part was the fresh arugula (gave some crunch and flavor to the soupiness) and the tomatoes.

The patio looks fun, and I'm sure the $11 lunch buffet is great for those that eat meat (it looked like a pretty meaty buffet). Maybe I'd come back for a drink on the patio? But I'll save the seats here for out of staters that don't know better.

I'm sorry! If I ever become in the 1% I'll consider coming back!"
1462,"David's is a classic in Portland. Staff is always wonderful. Lunch offerings are generally delicious. Not sure if it's due to ""being off-season for restaurants here in Portland"" however, we have had lunch twice this week and today the special sandwich was Cajun haddock. The most dry piece of flavorless haddock I have ever eaten in my life. Totally lifeless sandwich and oily fries. The restaurant was not busy so no excuse for shipping out a terrible sandwich. Partners pasta salad was an over cooked pasta mayonnaise mess. What's the deal David's? We are locals we want a great meal any time! 
*update* met an out-of-town friend at David's before Thanksgiving for appetizers. He had dined at David's Opus 10 previously and w aged to revisit. Are THE BEST CALAMARI OF MY LIFE! Homerun for David's chef & staff. Also very accommodating staff that evening."
1463,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here. We will absolutely come back. He has the shrimp and grits, I had the haddock.  Both out of tho world.  Attentive server. Window seat which, in spite of the cold temps, was nice and warm.  Fantastic."
1464,This is a good stop for happy hour. A decent selection of drinks and appetizers and prices are good. However the dinner menu was limited and seemed overpriced.
1465,"The portion sizes were perfect. In America we are so used to huge portion sizes that when we get anything smaller we think it should be cheaper. Wrong.

These dishes are FRESH and the perfect size for what we are supposed to eat. Your paying for the quality not quantity . I'd rather have amazing quality food that is unique and tastes wonderful than a large quantity of mediocre  food. 

So yes you may be paying a little more but these are chefs. You gotta appreciate the art that goes into these dishes because it's amazing."
1466,"This was a great dining experience! We loved the evening. Everyone was very nice and accommodating at the restaurant. We ordered the crabcakes and the brussels sprouts as appetizers. They were both incredible. I especially lost it over the brussel sprouts. The ginger flavor was AMAZING! We also really enjoyed the peppered filet and the avocado and basil mozzarella dish. 

They have a nice wine list as well. Would recommend coming here for dinner anytime."
1467,"One of the best restaurants in Portland!  David's is smaller in size with an outdoor patio in front of the restaurant and dining inside with seating at a counter along an exposed kitchen.  My husband and I had a table inside by the front window. Kim was our server and provided good service and recommendations. My husband and I started with a cocktail. Him the special gin basil cocktail and me with a vodka grapefruit cocktail. Both were so refreshing. A basket of warm parmesan cheese rolls were brought to our table. These were the bomb...soft, warm, cheesy goodness!  We shared the tuna tartare, which is the best I've ever had. A generous portion of cubed tuna with pacific rim flavors and four waffle potato crisps. This starter was full of flavor and freshness. The tuna melted in my mouth.  Next, we shared the watermelon salad with avocado mousse, cucumbers and sweet pea tendrils. Another great flavor profile and generous portion. We really enjoyed this salad.  For our entrees, my husband ordered the haddock and I ordered the salmon. Kim told me that the salmon was prepared medium rare and I was happy to hear that as I always like salmon cooked that way.  Unfortunately, my salmon was not cooked medium rare. It was on the dryer side, more medium to medium well.  It lost its moistness.  The little dabs of sauce on my plate did not give my fish enough moisture. I was disappointed with the way the fish was prepared. My husband's haddock was on the dryer side as well, but he had enough sauce to moisten his fish. After the start to our dining experience, we were surprised that the entrées fell short.   For this reason, I took away a star for the preparation of the fish dishes. I would still dine here in a heartbeat trying something else. I could tell from the starter and salad that the dryness of our fish preparation could've merely been a miss for one night.  Overall, we did enjoy the ambience of the restaurant, those damn good parmesan rolls, the starter and salad, not to mention the service we received."
1468,"David's is definitely our go-to spot on any day of the week if we're looking for consistent, delicious food that isn't wildly expensive. My boyfriend and I usually go to the South Portland location, but switched things up when we decided last minute that we wanted burgers. We walked in and they were fortunately able to seat us at he chefs table, which we like more than an actual table tbh. We were served their garlic knots, which are delicious (but drenched in oil FYI), and proceeded to order our burgers until several other items on the menu caught our attention. I ended up getting the pepper crusted tuna steak and was not disappointed! Cooked perfectly rare, super fresh, and full of flavor. The asparagus and soba noodles that accompanied the tuna were a nice, light addition as well. Will continue to return!"
1469,"This is a must!!!!
We had the best lunch. 
Pulled Asian pork sandwich with Asian Slaw,  it was full of flavor and delicious . The open kitchen atmosphere is modern, European and service top notch. Ashley our server was so professional and kind. The Garlic Knobs were the best and Ashley sweetly boxed us up some to go. First time in Maine and the people are the friendliest . Keep it up Maine we will be back!!!
Ratcliffe's Royal Reviews"
1470,"The most amazing restaurant I've been to thus far! Our server was Tyler, very informative. Gave us some insight on Portland along with excellent service. I'm vegan so they accommodated my diet so well. I started with a pomegranate lemon drop martini, perfect size drink, for an appetizer I ordered the bruschetta and it was the best damn bruschetta ever! For my lunch I ordered the mushroom pizza made vegan, AMAZING! I'm so full from three slices. Best damn food in Portland I promise!!!!!"
1471,"Went there twice during our long weekend stay in Portland. The clam chowder is a must have, one of the best I ever had. Reservation is highly recommended for dinner."
1472,"Amazing is the only word to come to mind. A mind blowing night of original flavors paired with classic dishes cooked to perfection. We started with tuna tartar in a vinaigrette dressing, followed by salmon in a miso soy glaze, and sirloin steak in a port reduction. Everything was on point paired with amazing service by all involved. A+"
1473,"We went here for dinner.  I got the meatloaf and my friends got the lobster ravioli and potato bacon pizza.  Everything was amazing!  So very delicious, will definitely go back next time I'm in town."
1474,"How can I ever go back to a normal bread basket after being served fresh baked garlic knots at David's? But seriously... these were some of the best garlic knots that I've ever tried. And David's isn't even an Italian restaurant!

Despite filling up on several rounds of garlic knots (whoops) we still made room for a delicious seafood feast. I ordered blackened shrimp wrapped scallops over corn risotto. This wasn't a huge portion, but what the meal lacked in quantity it made up for in quality. All of the seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection, and the risotto was creamy and flavorful.

My mans was hankering for a lobster dinner during our entire Maine vacay, and finally got his fix at David's. Despite the high price tag, the dinner came with an appetizer of blackened shrimp, a bowl of clam chowder, a full lobster and a side of mashed potatoes. So needless to say, he was extremely happy.

Although the indoor area was chic and beautifully decorated, we decided to eat outside because of the beautiful weather and did not regret it!

So the verdict- portions are a bit small and prices are a bit high, but... everything is hella tasty and fresh, the vibe is cool and everyone who works there is super sweet. Oh, and fresh baked garlic knots. I'll just leave it at that."
1475,"Heard a lot about this place. Read a lot of great reciews, so we decided to head off there for lunch during restaurant week.

Interior is very welcoming. There is a very large clock that looks amazing. I love the fact that the kitchen is open, only downside of that, walking out smelling like grilled food. 

Food was ok. Nothing spectacular about it like I had read. Not sure if it was because I had high expectations, I was not impressed. For appetizers I had the clam chowder with thyme and bacon (highly recommend) and my friend had the beet bruchetta. For entree I had the Mediterranean tuna salad. It was ok. Spring mix with artichoke and grilled tuna. My friend likes her grilled mix; which included steak, shrimp and scallops with mashed potatoes.  She loved her dish.  For dessert we both had the creme brulee. It was good but my sugar (caramel) layer was not completely torched and thus it was a little chewy instead if a hard candy. 

Service: It was lunch time when we went, it was busy, it took about five minutes before someone realized we were standing there waiting to be seated. Not sure if our waitress was new or simply overwhelmed. Took her a while to get our orders and get our drinks. My friend ordered the mixed grill, she simply placed our dishes without checking with her if her steak was done the way she wanted. Our checks were mixed up with another couple and it took her a while again to strengthen it out. 

Might visit again for dinner in the future."
1476,Service was great. We arrived early for our 8 PM dinner reservation and we were seated right away. Our server was very attentive. There was a special menu for Maine Restaurant Week. The price was great for the portions we received. The garlic knots were complimentary and full of flavor. It was really buttery and garlicky (not that it's a bad thing). Overall we enjoyed our meal and the ambiance was great.
1477,"Creative menu supported by excellent service - what more can you ask for.   Some reviewers seem put off by the menu or dishes, but if you are looking for somewhere special, (though go I don't know Portland we'll), I would think Davids is on the short list of places to go.   The food was perfect with presentation to match the dishes.   Bonus - the home made garlic knots were amazing!!!!   We'll keep this one on the list of places to revisit when in Portland..."
1478,"Once again the David & Co. deliver a unique, bespoke, couture cuisine experience that can only be described as 'art'. David's Monument Square and the Lounge is nothing short of delightful; quality food and impeccable service executed in a seamless way. We've enjoyed several David's eateries for years, and have to say short of KPT (Kennebunkport), Monument Square is our favourite. The location, quality, service, food, and excellence make David's Monument Square a sure-thing, every time. Artfully done food in the heart of Maine's artsiest city."
1479,"Went here last night for dinner - LOVED everything from the garlic knots, strawberry mojito, and lastly - my ahi tuna dish. However, the surprisingly best dish was my boyfriend's meatloaf - DELISH."
1480,"I walked out of David's having paid what seemed like a lot of $$ for a unsatisfying visit and dining experience.  We went there because of the great yelp reviews.

First the restaurant interior is very attractive and appealing.  I really thought..this will be very enjoyable.  The outdoor table dining looked kind of gritty so we chose to sit inside by the window.  The bar table was really cramped for four - uncomfortable.  The menu is on the expensive side with $30"" entrees.  The only one of us who liked our food was the one who ordered pizza.  The waiter pushed the halibut with crab and blueberry sauce really hard.  He told us several times it was the best dish on the menu.   I thought it was really terrible.   Picture overcooked sawdusty halibut folded over in a cube topped with bread crumbs mixed with something that was supposed to be crab all sitting in a pool of sweet blueberry sauce.  Just awful.  Don't order this.  The seafood brochettes were also overcooked and tasteless.  The brussels sprouts we soaked with oil and a sweet sauce.  They tasted like oil."
1481,"Had a wonderful time here celebrating a friends birthday.

The cocktails were great, the food was on point, and the atmosphere was fantastic.

They even wrote in a nice happy birthday note on the our friends fried calamari plate in chocolate. 

David's is all about the small touches like that. Another example is when we ordered the peppered filet to be split among 4. Instead of simply slicing the filet they created 4 individual plates. Planning on returning"
1482,"Everything we had was fantastic!   Lobster ravioli, meatloaf, and duck was outstanding!   Try the avocado caprese an amazing dish!"
1483,Returned to David's after a long g time away and am glad I did! Sat at the counter overlooking the chefs at work! The garlic knots are amazing! Raviolis were so tasty- and filling!! Definite return trip in my future
1484,"This was quite a disappointment. Over crowded, high prices food, service was adequate but nothing spectacular. Was definitely not a relaxed eating experience. The food was just ok. Nothing to write home about."
1485,"So Damn Good.

We were in Portland for one night and wanted a vegan friendly restaurant with good, new American food in the Arts District... Davids hit the spot. We're from NYC and Honestly, this restaurant was in par with some of 1 Michelin star establishments we've ate at. 

The food was excellent. All around excellent.
Apps we had were bruschetta(vegan) and clam/shrimp chowder. The bruschetta flavors were excellent, although the crostini it was served on was a bit soggy from the balsamic, but eh, it was unlike any bruschetta I've ever had; hummus and fig paste tapenade with juicy tomatoes and a balsamic reduction. Excellent sweetness/savory ratio. Chowder's chowder. It was good; nuff' said. 

Entrees included grilled shrimp/scallop skewers, lobster/shrimp dinner, and mushroom piccata(vegan). All were good.  
Shrimp and scallops were cooked well, with an excellent cream sauce. Lobster was tasty. Very good Maine lobster, well cooked, fresh. The shrimp that came with it were pan-seared and covered with a cucumber chili sort of sauce. Mmmmmm.
Mushroom piccata was delicious. Crispy oyster mushrooms with polenta and a creamy sauce. Sauce had the perfect texture. Cashew (non dairy ricotta?) was delicious. Presentation for all was excellent.  Dessert was a Godiva cheesecake. Fricken gold. One of THE best desserts I've ever had. And I've had a lot. 

Ambience was quaint, romantic, and cozy. We came  here in early January... and were the only ones in the restaurant, so perhaps we came on an off day, but everything was still perfect. Our waiter Tyler was very attentive and very helpful."
1486,"Creative dishes and very good service. My family enjoyed calamari (it had a Greek flare with feta and olives mixed in), cup of clam chowder with shrimp, salmon cakes, lobster ravioli, beet salad, garden salad, and Shipyard beer. 

We love the decor and sitting close to the open kitchen design was fun - we got to hear and see what was going on with the kitchen. Absolutely come here for excellent sea food and cool ambiance."
1487,"Came here for happy hour with a few girlfriends (Monday-Friday from 3-6pm). Solid 3.5 star happy hour in my book. There are a handful of food choices that range from $5-12. The choices are basically appetizers on any menu and priced and portioned as such. I didn't feel like I was getting a happy hour deal here, just choosing from an appetizer portion of a menu. The menu didn't really excite me, but I was hungry. I chose the bruschetta ($5.75) and pot stickers ($5). With the bruschetta you get three large pieces that tasted okay, they were very messy to eat and sticky. Probably would not order again. The pot stickers were tasty, you get about 10-12 quarter sized pot stickers. I would probably order these again for the price. 

The drink menu looked more exciting. There were some interesting and unique options to choose from. Infused cocktails, well martinis and manhattans are $6. Sangria and house wines are $5. Draft beer $4. The infused cocktails are what got my attention. I chose the spiced punch cause of the mention of nutmeg in the description. I was looking forward to something different. Unfortunately, there was no spice about it.  If there was any nutmeg in the drink you could not taste it. Just tasted like fruit punch. The drink tasted fine, but I ordered it specifically for the nutmeg experience. 

Would I come back? Probably. The service was friendly. However, the space is rather small and intimate. The tables are also small and I would not recommend this place to parties greater than 2-3 people unless you made a reservation."
1488,"I'd say this gets at least a 4.5 - but I don't make it here as often as I think I should (for some reason). They have consistently very delicious food - at fairly good prices (a bit higher than average in some cases but totally worth it). Food, cocktails, dessert - all good - and service has usually been great. The garlic knots are amaze balls.

Last time I heard, they were doing a lunch buffet that's a really good deal. Also, I haven't ever been to Happy Hour until this past week and it seemed like a really good deal too (not many places have cocktails like a good Old Fashioned for $6 ! Plus it's 3 hours long)."
1489,"Holy smokes, try the garlic knots and the crispy podstickers and Asian beef. Omg, so good!"
1490,Best place I've been in Portland! I got the sirloin with the blackened shrimp and scallops skewer. To die for! Nice ambience and great service. Will definitely be back!
1491,Lobster ravioli was hands down the best ravioli I've had in the states! Very fresh and flavorful!  The side salad was great too and I love their homemade dressing!
1492,"When in Maine...I suppose that one should go and eat at a seafood restaurant... That serves pizza... Unless, of course, you are not in the mood for seafood or gluten... Then, this is a bad choice for a restaurant.

Outdoor seating is plentiful, and it may be preferable to the indoor seating is the kitchen is grilling away and baking pizza without venting the place. If your server is kind, hopefully a note will help alleviate the eye-watering smoke.  The staff here is super friendly and accommodating. The bar is huge, and there is an equally impressive drink menu that is 3 pages (compared to the 1 for the menu of food choices).

The menu attempts to label what is vegetarian, gluten free and vegan. However, I find it strange that there was a vegan mark next to the bruschetta with cheese... So... Why should one believe the other markings??? Mmmm... Not sure.  None of the salad or vegetable appetizers are vegan... But you can ask to have an ingredient or two held off the item to make it vegan. Still... How can you ask to hold something off if you don't know everything that's in it? I am not convinced they are aware either.

The menu marks 2 vegan items- a vegan pizza with cashew cream base and a stir fry. It might be just about the worst stir fry ever? The sauce was watery. The veggies were interesting, but...??? Arugula? Navy beans? Minced red pepper? Ummm... I liked the veggie mix, but it should've just been like the rest of the menu: American or Italian flavors. Weak showing here for those seeking specific dietary restrictions."
1493,"Found this place online,read the reviews and wanted to try it.We didn't have reservation but the hostess had open seats at high top counter overlooking the kitchen,great seats if your a foodie.crispy fried brussel sprouts are Awesome. My wife had the meatloaf (the best ever) I had the open face lobster raviolli, it had shrimp & scallops in it also.Excellent meal..1 picky thing about it was the lobster meat,claw meat,not the best but it was very good.Will return the next time in Portland.Great staff,chefs were very friendly and talkative."
1494,"Got the salmon cakes and lobster dinner. Great food and great service. My boyfriend and I came for a weekend in Portland, and this was our favorite meal and experience. Relaxing and warm environment. Every single thing we got for the night was extremely delicious (including the wine and free garlic knots). Tyler, our waiter, was also super kind and helpful."
1495,"I went into David's with two other guests around 8:30pm on a Saturday night. We had already had dinner elsewhere but David's dessert menu looked good and I never turn down a good dessert. When we walked in, it was busy but there were several tables open and many tables were wrapping up. I told the host that we will only be ordering dessert and he was very friendly and sat us at the counter looking over the kitchen. When the waitress arrived, Erin B. we came to find out, she served us bread and menus. We immediately informed her that we would just be ordering dessert and that we had informed the host when we were seated. She was clearly aggravated and took the bread and menus away without speaking another word to us. When she came back for our order, she was not friendly at all. I asked for an Americano in which she asked for detailed instructions on how to make so I decided to go with a regular coffee instead, which ended up being luke warm when I got it. In a city with so many coffee shops, I find it hard to believe that no one else has ever ordered an Americano. We ordered two desserts and each of us got a drink. The desserts were just ok, the carrot cake was dry and chocolate torte was ok but I have definitely had better. They were not fresh at all. The waitress served us the drinks but other than that did not come over to check on us and was not warming to us at all until she brought the bill in which then she was very friendly, smiling and told us to have a good night. 

I have several family members in the restaurant industry and I understand that it can be frustrating to lose a table to people just ordering dessert so I typically tip well but I was very upset with the level of service we received. Not to mention, there were several open tables. We were there for maybe 25 minutes and nothing about the service (other than the host) or the food was impressive. In a city with so many great restaurants, I recommend going somewhere else. I will not be going back."
1496,"Had dinner here tonight, chowder followed by roast duck ands a 15 year old port for dessert.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
1497,Outstanding service and fantastic food. The open kitchen design makes the seating area slightly on the warm side. However don't be turned away due to it. High end restaurant with high quality food.
1498,Had a reservation and had to cancel same-day due to unforeseen emergency circumstances and they legit had no sense of humanity or concern and would not waive the $25 PER PERSON cancellation fee. The manager was rude on the phone and if this is how they treat their customers then I will NEVER go back to this place.
1499,"Pretentious, overhyped tourist trap, not for the real people of Portland.  

Went for dinner Friday night we had an awkward table outside, the seat was pushed in almost completely because it was directly against the door so I had to kind of climb in awkwardly to sit. The table was pitched at an angle on the sidewalk so we had to hold onto our drink glasses through the duration of the meal so they didn't slide off the table.  Fine, we weren't really expecting anything we didn't have a reservation so they seated us wherever they could find a spot.  

Water glass on the table was dirty/marked, I brought it to the servers attention she gave me a long winded explanation about how they are stacked and they create marks and asks if I want another glass, yes I do so she goes to get me another one.  Dirty/marked glass is fine at a local brew pub down the street not a 50 dollar a head restaurant.  She also pulled the menu that was at my setting because it was covered in oil stains but then returned with the same soiled menu for me (I'm guessing they didn't have another menu that they could use)   I should have taken this interaction as a warning and just because it didn't get better. 

We watched as the table next to us was attended when it took over 30 minutes just to get our water glasses full.  (Again, I understand they had a reservation, we did not but when they sit down after us and you bring their entire table water it takes little effort to bring us a carafe too since we are the only two tables out there).  We felt a little like lepers out there, I know we weren't an eight top like the table next to us but our dining experience is just as valid and important as theirs.  

So after being disappointed with service let me get into the food...  

Garlic knots they give you at the table we bit into them and hot oil poured down our faces, just an obscene excessive amount of oil. I'm glad I had my napkin in my lap or it would have ruined my dress.  My husband was so disgusted he couldn't eat anymore after the first one.  

Polenta fries were good and really the only positive note for our entire meal.   

My husband's filet was sickly grey and look like it had been boiled instead of grilled over a direct flame (I'm guessing sous vide without a finishing sear?).  I had the haddock/crab with the risotto one of the most expensive items on the menu, the haddock was overcooked to chewy jerky status, crab on top was dry and the risotto was a gummy wall paper paste mess.  I couldn't even believe how terrible it was, under-seasoned, overcooked,  inedible.  I took four bites and just left the majority of my entree.  

Our meal was over a hundred dollars and  we both left disappointed and hungry."
1500,"David's Restaurant - Portland, ME - 7/21/2015

For an out of towner the parking is a bit put-offish initially until you figure out that although you probably won't find off street parking any time soon, there are large municipal paring garages very close by. The sign is not that visible from the street and I had to call  called to confirm the GPS brought me to the right place.

They are actually two restaurants in one location... David's Restaurant and David's Opus Ten that have somewhat different menus and seating... Why...? I'm not quite sure... For this seating I am at David's restaurant...

I was immediately seated by the very friendly hostess and introduced to Angela, my server. The decor is interesting and somewhat eclectic with its mix of earth tones, brick and art. The kitchen is visible from the left dining room and large ceiling fans waft the delicious aromas thruout the building...

I'm not much of a drinker but they had quite the selection of International wines as well... All available by the bottle, half bottle or glass... Not to mention the specialty drinks and a selection of bottled & draft beers...

Sitting waiting for me on my table were some of the most amazing garlic Nuts tossed in Garlic, Olive Oil & Parmesan Cheese... I've ever had! It bit warmer than room temperature and I almost wonder if they weren't just purposely put out for me as I had reservations to tonights dining extravaganza...

The Clam Chowdah was every bit as scrumptious as I imagined it would be with its chunks of potatoes, bacon, herbs and onions... Accompanying the Chowdah were two
Grilled Shrimps with Lime, Brown Sugar and Citrus Almond Coulis- Tequila Lime Shrimp they called it. 

For my main.. The 1 1/2 Lb Lobstah... Common..., I am in Maine on the coast aren't I? What else would I have here?... That along with Garlic Mashed Potatoes... Perfectly prepared with little chunks of They cal this dish; ""The David's Lobstah Dinner""...

I gotta tell you... My mouth is watering! The aroma... The decor... The first courses... Mmmmm... Mmmmmm....

I was going to pass on dessert right up until Angela mentioned the Snickers CheeseCake in an Oreo Cookie Crumb crust...

Let me tell you about the Cappuccino... Three layers... Cream... Cafe... Frothed Milk... and it that isn't enough... a Rock Candy Stir! One of the nicer presentations of Cappuccino out there today...

Everything about this place is awesome. I quickly forgot about the initial parking thing... Next time you find yourself in Portland Maine around dinner time, you need to come here! I highly recommend it!"
1501,"After being told of insanely long waits at other restaurants David's was a perfect spot to settle on, just as good if not better than the other over-hyped places we tried. It's small and a few blocks from the waterfront but still walkable distance and we were pleasantly met with fresh from the oven garlic knots. Both the food and drink menu had a lot of options and service was very good. All of the dishes ordered were delicious, favorites included Haddock with Peekytoe Crab and Blackened skewers of shrimp & scallops."
1502,I came here for the first time for my birthday! I had the meatloaf and it was the best I've ever had! The drinks for happy hour were also really good. The menu was fairly priced and I would definitely be coming back again! Would highly recommend.
1503,"Popped in here for a happy hour snack and drink.  Steak tartare was as good as anyone's and the bartender was very friendly and nice.  Great place, I'd go back in a flash!"
1504,"I am not a pizza fan.  At all.  I'm the kind of person that can have pizza once a year and not crave it again.

When we saw pizza on the menu at this restaurant we decided to share a sharing sized pizza.   Wow.  I am so glad we did.

Crisp thin crust with flavourful parmesan in the crust itself.   Amazing home made marinara sauce.  You could smell the freshness of the ingredients.   Amazingly spicy and plentiful sausage.

My arugula salad was amazingly fresh and so well presented.   Likely the best salad I have had on quite some time.

My husband had the clam chowder to start.  So chunky and thick broth.  He said that it was the best clam chowder he had ever had.

The ""bread"" that came to our table were miniature buttery croissants.  No added butter needed.  Amazingly flavourful and very different.

The decor is simple.  The bar area is well lit and inviting.

We sat by the window close to the open kitchen.  We watched the chefs preparing food with a lot of care and attention to detail.

Their dishes showed that attention.   Amazing."
1505,This place is like one of my favorite fine cuisine restaurant in Portland Maine ! Yay ! 5 *****!!!!!
1506,"You won't be sorry you came here.  Great location, great food.  We ate the open seafood ravioli and the Halibut... both were excellent as were the craft cocktails.  We were in Portland for 5 days and kept saying we need to go back."
1507,"We visited David's for dinner late Sunday afternoon, looking forward to some excellent seafood. We were a bit taken back by the $25/head reservation cancellation fee, but we knew we'd show up; so no worries. Our table was waiting for us and we were seated promptly. The storefront seating was roomy and neat.
Our waitress took our drink orders but lacked in civility; bad day perhaps?
I ordered the Haddock with Peekytoe Crab
While another of our party ordered the Skewer of Shrimp and Scallops. The rest of our group ordered beef menu items.
The presentation of my Haddock was great, but my first bite was a surprise that the flake of fish was tough and not so moist! My fish was overcooked, throughout. My friend's skewer of shrimp were also too cooked! When you pay $31 for a piece of food, you expect some expertise from the cook handling it.
In hindsight, I should have refused the fish and requested it be removed from the bill; what I did was inform the waitress that although I ate it, my fish was overcooked. It drew little sympathy from her as she barely uttered a word.
Won't be headed back to David's in Monument Sq anytime soon."
1508,"We were looking for cozy appetizer and drink place.
This was just OK. The lobster and avocado slider was lobster and cucumber."
1509,"One of the top tier spots in Portland, and much more bang for your buck than the comparable Fore Street or Street and Co.

Excellent service, even better food and great custom cocktails!"
1510,Amazing garlic knots and highly recommend the mussels!!! But everything was totally worth the trip. Definitely will head back.
1511,"Restaurant was recommended by a long-term Portland native. The dishes we selected were ones we had never had and were out of this world fresh and flavorful.  We shared an arugula and watermelon salad with heirloom tomatoes, feta, candied pecans, blood orange & champagne vinaigrette and red onion that was light, and delicately delicious.  We had the ginger scallion salmon with miso- blueberry brown butter, spaghetti squash and cucumber slaw, sesame snow peas and asparagus.  We had the seared mushroom napoleon with ginger - coconut-lemongrass broth, curried spaghetti squash galette, spinach basil and cilantro.  For dessert an apple blueberry crisp and creme brulee.  Service was very positive and helpful, yet professional.   We would go back again in a heartbeat!"
1512,"Amazing restaurant. I seem to come here every time I visit Maine. Seafood was fresh, well made, flavorful. Appetizers came in good portions. Lobster was amazing. Service was excellent. Quite affordable given the quality of food and nice ambience. Will definitely try to come again when i visit Maine next time."
1513,Amazing steaks! Our waitress was excellent also. Will definitely be back next time we are in Portland!
1514,"Joining the 4 star brigade here! Although could go higher if persuaded.
4 of us had dinner here. I'd made reservations but we were coming from CT and our journey took longer than we'd hoped, so had to call and change the time - they were accommodating. 
When we arrived one of the hostesses was on the phone doing a booking and ended up taking cc details etc. from phone party and we stood around the desk waiting. She didn't really acknowledge us and it was left to a busy waitstaff member to at least say that she'd help us soon. Once we eventually got helped, we had a window high top table and it was a bit cramped ( there was an empty two top behind us which if in use would have made it impossible to get in and out for both tables) 
Ambiance for a Tuesday night in October was great. We were half an hour from kitchen closing. 
We shared the Brussel Sprout appetizer, which was crispy and tangy, not acidic as sometimes happens with Brussels. The portion was generous for sharing, even with 4 and paired with their yummy garlic rolls was a great palate prep for mains! Watch the garlic deliciousnous of that bread - mine was on my shirt in no time.
Each of us had a different main: steak, haddock special, salmon and the open lobster ravioli. Of the 4 the salmon was disappointing in portion size. Otherwise, the food was tasty and everyone agreed they would return if in the area. I gave the salmon diner some of my lobster main and he was really happy with the ravioli itself and rated that highly. We made a couple of requests about potato changes from mashed to fingerling and our server was happy to accommodate. 
By the time we hit dessert, we were pretty full but we managed to share the Berry Crisp- way more than a bite each and also flavorful. The ice cream was creamy without being cloying and the crisp was just that, crispy on top and juicy fruit beneath. 
So, in some areas, 5 star but the lack of help when arriving, time it took to get our drinks after ordering , which ( to us) needs a little floor organization and is not a reflection on our server, who was on top of things but busy, and we'd gom5 starts if came again. 
I've seen polarizing reviews on the pasta but mine was fabulous! The vegetables were crispy and finely sliced. A great pairing with the heavy sauce."
1515,"As the wife and I were thinking of going somewhere for our anniversary dinner, we were pleasantly surprised with a gift card from my boss to David's in Portland in Monument Square.

I don't think that we would have gone to this little place nestled right in between some other eateries like Shay's and Kamasouptra (shout out to upstairs ;)) unless we were given this gift card and I can honestly say that we will return.

The ambiance was amazing where we were sat right next to the open kitchen where you can see some of the creative and amazing looking dishes coming out throughout the evening.  There were dishes with filets and prawns strewn on large plates with decorative garnishes to feast the eyes on.

We were also seated right next to a romantic fireplace that, although this was July and the summertime, would be a beautiful centerpiece during the cold of winter.

The service was amazing.  She was very attentive and gave some delicious recommendations for our special night.

We started off with some delicious bread and garlic knots.  They were fresh and soft and warm when delivered to the table.

Our appetizers were some garlic and white wine mussels that were delicious and fresh with some leeks and tasty broth that we dipped the bread into after completing the mussels.

Our meals were to die for.  My wife had the Stuffed haddock that sat atop some delicious and rich risotto and fresh crunchy green beans.  This dish was both light and flavorful. 

I had the portobello mushroom ravioli in a red wine truffle sauce that was so rich and decadent and melted in your mouth when you took each bite.

For dessert, we had a salted caramel torte that they waitress kindly wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate with no attention or cheesy singing for the big day ;)

This was all topped off with a delicious cappuccino in a tall glass with a sugar stick for sweet flavor addition.

This little place was a great experience and I recommend it for anyone that is wiling to pay a good price.  It is not for the faint at heart when it comes to prices but was very well worth it on the special occasion.

The only drawback was the temperature was super cold in the restaurant for my wife.

Thank you David's for an special experience on a special day."
1516,"I treated my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday at David's. Growing up in the area, David's has a great reputation as a special occasion restaurant. For the price point, we had a pretty mediocre experience.

I made a reservation through Open Table for Saturday night and noted in the reservation we were celebrating a birthday. We were seated at a high top in the bar. That wasn't really what I was hoping for.

Our server was friendly and attentive. We started with the daily preparation of mussels. They were fine, but we found the mussels themselves to be not as fresh as they could have been, as well as a little tough.

For an entree, I had the sirloin, which was served with a reduction that tasted like a thick gravy. I found it to be too rich and I ate less than half of my meal. My boyfriend had the haddock and crab. The crab and risotto were both delicious. I found myself eating off of his plate more than mine.

Overall, our meal was fine, it just wasn't what I was hoping for on a special occasion splurge dinner. I've had much better meals in Portland for less money."
1517,"Amazing food & creative meals. Also, I never thought I'd be one for buffet but David's buffet is phenomenal"
1518,"Whats not to like? Great food great service   
Ali are waitress was accommodating sincere informative and versatile the food was presented well.  Maybe salty but i don't salt so you may love. 
The blackened filet was better than n new York. Ohhhhhhhh love this place"
1519,"Back in my college days at Boston University, there was one fine-dining restaurant on campus called (I think) ""Top of the Charles"". It was supposed to be the best the school had to offer, and where the school's regents, president, and trustees dined. It was where students went to impress dates and parents.

The reality was the menu items were given fancy names, but came out looking like.... well, shit on fancy plates. 

David's Restaurant, unfortunately, is the first restaurant to successfully reawaken my memory of my college ""fine dining"" eatery after 20 years of selective amnesia. No, it's not terrible, and it isn't shit on fancy China. But I think it tries too hard. Expectations were UP there..... reality was knee-high.

Don't get me wrong, there are a few good gems. The garlic/Parmesan free bread is good, the Brussels sprouts awesome, mussels, and steak entree were very good. But everything else was strictly college-level. Salmon cakes and their sauces confused the palate, the clam chowder was ""interesting"", the peanut soba in the peppered seared tuna tasted like a peanut butter accident, the tuna was a complete clash of taste buds, and the creme brûlée tasted highschool. 

I'm hoping I got this restaurant on an off night. The service is good, friendly, and earnest. Ambience is casual and alive. I won't write it off for now, and may come back another time to try."
1520,"The food was good if not great, Port  specials was overcooked as was my cod. Flavors on the house special Asian beef dumplings were good if a little aggressive.  Asian pulled pork appetizers were quite good.  Garlic bread could do with a serious decrease in the amount of oil and butter applied to it. Just too much. Service was extremely attentive...I believe our servers name was Kim and she could not have been more accommodating.
Restaurant is bustling and a little bit noisy but nothing extreme. All in all we enjoyed our evening."
1521,"Lovely intimate restaurant with an open kitchen and responsive staff. Good menu selection, well prepared. Moderate noise level. Garage parking a few steps away. Worth the price. Would visit again when next in Portland."
1522,"I was able to get a last minute reservation at Davids at 7PM this past Friday evening. Upon arriving we were seated promptly, and fresh garlic knots were soon dropped off. The garlic knots were hands down the best I've ever had, and were absolutely delicious. The wine list is extensive, and I thoroughly enjoyed the glass of rose I had. 

I got the lobster ravioli, and my boyfriend got the tuna. The ravioli was incredible, the ravioli itself was just herbs and ricotta, but tasted so fresh. The lobster, scallops, and shrimp were served with the ricotta pillows in a lobster cream sauce, and although I had never had lobster ravioli served this way, I realized I actually really appreciated this. I was able to see the lobster and it was definitely fresh, as were the scallops and shrimp. The tuna was perfectly seasoned and tasted incredible as well. 

When we're back in Portland, we'll definitely be back to Davids."
1523,"David's reasturant is in the bustling downtown area of Portland on Congress street. Among the many American cuisine options David's is one of many favorites. David Turin, chef and owner, has a unique flare for creating uniqueness from everyday American food. 

The place is popular, so you can just walk in, but for special nights I'd recommend making a reservation to ensure a table. 

The meal began with the  mushrooms and three cgeese arancini. This is made with fried risotto balls with mozzarella, parmesan and romano, and a sweet corn saffron cream. Very delicious! We also shared the cheese plate, which included varied cheeses, grapes spiced nuts, preserves, and crostinis. 

The main course was a succulent grilled pork tenderloin cooked medium rare and was tender and packed with flavor. We got garlic mashed potatoes (that packed intensely yummy flavor) to share with our meal. 

The waiters were extremely good, very knowledgeable about the dishes and clearly enthusiastic about their jobs. We really enjoyed the place. ."
1524,The garlic knots alone are worth 5 stars! Filet and lobster were both delicious! Great service.
1525,"Table for 4 by the bar. Very busy night as it was restaurant week. Our waitress (Allison) handled the busy night and with a smile. We all chose off the restaurant week menu. Choice of 1 from each of the 3 courses. We chose arugula salads ,butternut squash soup, and a andouille sausage salad. We were all very happy with our first course. 3 of us ordered the hake over spinach and the other ordered meatloaf. Everyone completely happy with their entrees. The fish was light and cooked perfectly. Meatloaf was unlike your traditional heavy meatloaf. Had a little crunch. Really great favors. Dessert was crime brûlée, brownie with ice cream and some sort of a chocolate fudge mousse cake. All delicious."
1526,I got the fish special..two overcooked shrimp on top of dried out haddock plopped on undercooked risotto. Husband's $22. Pizza was oK. Service was good. Drinks were fine. The food was a miss for four of the six. I was disappointed because I used to love this place.
1527,"The night started with a chipped water glass and got worse from there.

I brought 4 coworkers to David's for a nice meal and drinks after a successful work event. I ignored the chipped glass in front of me and ordered $200+ worth of food and drinks. Service was slow and awkward at best. The apps came out and I took my first bite of the Crab Rangoon special. I half swallowed it before unspooling a foot long hair from down my throat...my personal worst scenario when eating out. The rest of the table looked on in shock as i plopped it down on the plate. Fuggin gross. Server said he would comp it, didnt, had to call it out and rerun my card before I left. Before then, we also received a side plate with obvious, yet questionable, red goo smeared on the surface and a white/blonde eyelash in another bite of food. All we could do is laugh off the terrible dinner and get out of there asap. Would have liked more than the $14 app comp'd and/or maybe send a manager over to smooth things over. Will not be back."
1528,"Came here for lunch and was pleasantly pleased with our meal on the outside patio.  We split the mussels, which was cooked to perfection in a garlicky, lobster cream broth with corn and red onion.  Our next plate was the lobster tacos with a nice touch of watermelon salsa and packed with a lot of tasty flavor.  We finished our lunch with the haddock and crab that was accompanied with spinach, micro greens and mashed potatoes.  Excellent service and decently priced cocktails for $8.75.  Definitely recommend the mussels and lobster tacos."
1529,"Overall, this was a disappointment & not worth it.  Went for lunch on a beautiful weather day so we were happy to be able to sit outside, even after experiencing an unwelcoming host.  Served dirty plates with our appetizer, but couldn't catch waitress to let her know until she brought our entrees (we tried!). She gave a quick apology and removed the stack of plates, but didn't seem to realize how wrong it was or apologize for not looking over at our table or checking in after giving appetizer.  She seemed tired and almost put-out that she had to work.  Daughter liked her pizza and son liked his burger (even though it was a bit overcooked from the requested medium), but other 2 dishes were mediocre (Shrimp & Avocado Caprese Salad and the Lobster Roll) -- both sounded & looked much more appealing than how they tasted.  Bathrooms were dirty and smelly.  It was a Friday at 12:30pm, but the restaurant inside had a feeling like it did not recover from a Saturday night.  Lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids with no dessert, 1 appetizer, 1 beer, and 2 iced teas was $92 before tip.  Went here due to the reviews, so wanted to let others know it may not be worth it.  Perhaps we were just unfortunate.  Ya know that feeling like you want to vomit and start all over again...?"
1530,"David's is in a great location and the decor is great but I have to say the food and service are just adequate.  The bartender was attentive while we waited on our table, but after we were seated we felt incredibly rushed.  We were in and out of there in about 45 minutes.  

The food was okay, not outstanding (and not near as good as the David's in Kport or South Portland).  We waited for our bread, then it came out with the appetizers and before we were half way through those, the main courses came.  I had the duck and it was underdone, and I prefer my meats rare so that's saying something.  It was also rather bland.

I feel as if I am being totally negative here, and that's not usually like me, but after reading some of the other reviews, I think it might be in a downward trend.  I'd like to try it again, but with the prices I'd need to be convinced to return."
1531,"My wife and I were new to Portland. We checked Yelp for dinner recommendations    There were a number of recommendations for restaurants in the marina area. However, we were unable to get reservations for any of these places. We were able to get reservations for David's which turned out to be a wonderful meal. 

First, there is a public parking garage a block away which was convenient. The restaurant is only a five minute walk from there.  There is both inside and outside seating.  We had booked the reservation through open table and we were greeted by a pleasant young lady. We were seated promptly by the hostess. 

The meal started with an excellent olive oil dipping sauce with parmesan cheese in the middle if the oil to mix in. You were provided with a bread basket which included the tasty garlic knots.  When we requested additional garlic knots they were brought out immediately. 

My wife ordered the lobster special which came with an appetizer of two grilled shrimp and a cup if chowder.  Both were very good. I ordered the fried calamari which was prepared with feta cheese, kalamata olives, red onion & a balsamic reduction which was also very tasty. My entree was the blackened swordfish with polenta and snow peas which was delicious. 

I finished my meal with a nice looking cappuccino.  We didn't try any of the desserts but I can't imagine that they wouldn't be as good as the meal that we ate!

The staff were all very friendly. The hostess was going to seat us in one area and decided it wasn't a good option for us and immediately found us an alternative table.  Our waitress was friendly and discussed some of the popular choices when asked for recommendations. 

I highly recommend David's."
1532,"One of the best happy hours in town from one if the city's premier fine dining locations. It features $5 appetizers and $4 select local pints. 

I ordered the calamari and the pot stickers and was quite impressed. The calamari was fresh, with a light yet crisp and salty batter--on point, if I say so myself. The dipping sauce was a creative fusion of sweet and spicy thousand island and tangy coconut base. It carries a funky flavor that complements the calamari well, albeit in an untraditional way.  The potstickers were also quite good. They were on the crispier side, and contained a mix of meat and spring vegetables. Very tasty!

The indoor dining has a classy ambiance--low light and some sort of smooth jazz or acoustic music playing. The patio is also great when it's in season. Monument Square is a great place to enjoy a beer and quality appetizers on the end of a full summer day in the city."
1533,"If you're going to Portland Maine do yourself a favor and do dinner at David's. Great atmosphere and the steamed lobster dinner is hands down best I've had. Very relaxing environment. We truly enjoyed this restaurant. It's a must in Portland! Friendly staff great drinks and food. 

Barry D"
1534,"Love their Key Lime Pie martini and salmon.   I was disappointed with the creme brulee, it was cold and was like scrambled eggs... should be smooth and not from a fridge pre-made.  The service is always good!"
1535,Really delicious food and great service. My husband and I had dinner here for our anniversary. He had duck and I had filet mignon. Both meals were excellent. We followed with cappuccinos and dessert. This was our first time visiting Portland and we're really glad we found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it.
1536,"Had a business lunch here and it was absolutely amazing! Small restaurant with a great personality! The service was great and the food was amazing. I had the butternut squash risotto with shrimp and scallops. Really enjoyed coming here and if I'm ever back in Portland, I will definitely dine at David's!"
1537,"The ginger crusted salmon is the bomb! The haddock and crab is just okay. The mussels are nicely flavored, but small. You get what you pay for here.

Our waiter didn't even give us bread, or refill our water."
1538,"My husband and I are completely okay with judging a restaurant based on their burgers. I've had amazing $6 burgers and fantastic $20 burgers. 

David's burgers were a huge disappointment. I would expect some flavor for a $12 burger. Some restaurants can do a burger with cheddar cheese and applewood bacon really well. David's isn't one of them. Oh...don't even get me started on the extra FOUR DOLLARS for a handful of fries as a substitute for potato chips. This is Maine...it's not like potatoes are expensive.

The service wasn't great either. We came for an early lunch and we waited a long time for our food. My mother-in-law had to flag down the waiter for the check. 

David's is in a great location, but I don't think we will be going back. It seems like it would be a nice place for dinner, but based on our lunch experience I've lost interest. There are too many other places in Portland to try."
1539,"Our server was very nice, I don't like mussels in tomato sauce, which they were serving for the night, so she had me made in white sauce. I have to say we kinda felt special.We also had lobster bisque before main course and it was very creamy.

But the best part was our entree, the lobster ravioli, it was simply delicious."
1540,"We came here a on Saturday night and was seated immediately. The service was fast and attentive. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the complementary bread and garlic bread served. The garlic bread was delicious and cheesy, the garlic oil dip also had lots of spices in it that made it really good. We ordered clam chowder, which was creamy and delicious, it was sweeter than most clam chowder I had and had bacon bits in it. The lobster cake was also very soft, fresh and tasty. The superstar of the meal was the Open Faced Lobster ravioli, it was so ridiculously good its mindblowing. The dish had more seafood than actually ravioli, the sauce in this dish was a cream based buttery lobster sauce that was simply heavenly, every bite of scallop, shrimp and lobster dipped in this sauce was a flavor explosion. This is a must try if you come to David's!"
1541,"Continuously a lovely experience each time we dine here. The food is spectacular - the open faced lobster ravioli is my favorite meal ever. We travel 2 hours every year for my birthday to celebrate with dinner at David's. Great cocktails, friendly and attentive staff, the food is epic. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1542,Food was absolutely amazing. Had the salad soup and their pizza. Great service. Must try!
1543,"The one extra star goes to the garlic knots and the young man who took care of us when our waiter was no where to be found.

Been living in Portland for 6-7 years and we've been to David's for Happy Hours a couple times over the years for a cheap snack/drink and visited one time for dinner a few years ago.  These experiences didn't have us even remember David's existed but last night we decided to give it another try as it's a close walk from home and sort of date-nighty.  Should have known from the get-go it would be pretty miserable.  We sat down but weren't greeted by our waiter for at least 15 minutes, and then another 15 minutes to get our drinks (red wine in a white wine glass, amateur hour).  By the time we ordered we had devoured all of the complimentary garlic knots (which are amazing little balls of joy by the way) so we started with the calamari which came out roughly 5 minutes later hot of out the fryer with all the breading coming off with grease....mehhhhh.  Soggy calamari in a small bowl = forgettable. 

Cue trying to get a second drink with 2 empty glasses on the table (and 2 empty water glasses)- our waiter breezed by in a hurry but never stopped to ask us how things were going or if we would like another beverage.  Our meals came out brought by a helpful second server who cleared our appetizer dishes and got us refills on beverages. He was the shining star in an otherwise lackluster service team.  Dinner was forgettable - I got a vegetarian mushroom dish with polenta that was flavorless and difficult to eat, sort of a bowl of slop really....Hubs got the duck which he seemed to enjoy, minus a thick layer of blueberries on the top of it that seems to cater to tourists rather than actually what tastes good on duck.  The service was just so poor, non-present, and clueless that it was sort of a joke - prices should not be where they are if the service can't keep up or provide a consistent and upscale dining experience.  

IF we ever come back it will be to get a bottle of wine (white, since those are the only glasses they seem to use) and eat garlic knots all day.  Do not recommend for dinner."
1544,"We started with the mussels, they where very fishy and rubbery. My wife ordered the fish, it was overlooked and dry including the crab stuffing. I ordered the steak filet, it was overcooked and cold by the time it came to the table. The waitress was very nice and tried to be helpful but we asked to talk to the manager. The manager was very rude and just seemed bothered to be talking to us. She acted like she was better than us and did nothing to help the situation with lots of attitude. This place is way overpriced and we will not go back."
1545,"Great service and food. Especially loved the garlic knots served instead of your traditional italian bread and butter. I was here with a large party and our waiter was cheerful, efficient, and honest when helping us decide on what to eat. I went with a salmon special with mussels and chorizo. While a little salty, the fish was cooked perfectly and the mussels were delicious. I tried my friend's scallops from her lobster ravioli entree and wished I had ordered it for myself. I got a ""daydreamer"" cocktail which was the perfect amount of sweet. We ordered two cheese plates for the table which was probably the only downfall, in my opinion; too small of a portion for the money. 

If you are looking for great seafood in an intimate setting in Portland, I'd reccommend David's."
1546,"Ah, Portland, Maine. So many restaurants, so little time. And there is David's. After dining many times at Fore Street, Street and Co, and many others, last night we went to Davids. The food is right there with the best of Portland. I had a signature Cosmo which was lovely for 10 bucks, very reasonable for today's skyrocketing cocktail prices.We shared the muscles of the day and the fried Brussels sprouts. Perfect! I had the most amazing lobster roll as my main course. About a pound and a half lobster with great mayo, served in a croissant with the best homemade chips ever. All of us loved our food. 
Two complaints, ergo 4 stars instead of 5. The dining room window table temperature was way too warm..second, and most irksome was the EXORBITANT price of espresso, $3.95 for a single and a whopping $7.50 for a double. Out of whack with otherwise very fair prices for everything else. 

We will happily return next year, but will avoid the espresso."
1547,"Though the interior was less than impressive, I have been led to believe that this one of the better restaurants in downtown Portland, but we were there for the happy hour that runs 3-6PM daily.  Though the bar was empty on our arrival, it quickly filled after a group of business people began arriving. My wife enjoyed a pair of Placido pinot grigios while my wine of choice was Hidden Crush cabernet sauvignon. Priced at only $4 per glass, I can recommend both.  We also enjoyed a bowl of PEI mussels cooked in a tarragon, white wine and butter sauce along with a garlic knots that proved to be addictive."
1548,"I went there with a large group a couple of weeks ago. They can't accommodate large groups so we had to sit a different tables. Not a problem but it was a bit of a downer. 

The food was very good. The service was excellent. I ordered a hamburger and it came on a flat bread that was toasted and the combination wasn't what I expected so ate the hamburger as a steak. It was really good. 

They also serve these buttery rolls that are simply to die for. You eat them and you are filled up. 

I would have given then 5 stars except for the seating."
1549,"Came for New Years Eve dinner - and were very glad that we did. The food was excellent, although the seating was a bit crammed and service was average. Our apps, the crab cakes and brussel sprouts were very good - spot on. The meals, the Filet Special, and the open face lobster ravioli, were delicious. We preferred the steak, which was a fantastic medium rare. I am not a huge pasta eater and the pasta was excellent, however a bit creamy for my taste. The desert, was incredible. Godiva Chocolate cheesecake. One word - YES."
1550,"I brought my boyfriend for dinner on his birthday after reading all of the excellent Yelp reviews. I was surprised to see that there were only a handful of other people at the restaurant. The food was excellent! The garlic rolls were out of this world, and the olive oil dipping sauce was to die for. We ordered the duck potstickers which were on the specials menu that day. They were AMAZING. I'm still thinking about them days later! We also had the Conan the Barbarian pizza which was great. I'd be curious to try the other things on the menu.

The only downside was that they close pretty early (9 pm). We ordered a bottle of wine and it was tough to finish in the time we were there."
1551,In July we were wandering around Portland looking for a place to have a bridesmaid luncheon in September.  We happened upon this place and the manager showed us the private room we would use.  We decided then and there that this would be a wonderful place and IT WAS!  Kim was extremely helpful in the menu planning (we were in NC) and suggestions.  She responded to emails quickly.  The menu had excellent choices.  The lunch was 4 days ago and I (and all guests!) were so very impressed with the food and service.  Everything was perfect.  We had 14 adults and 2 children but the room could certainly have accommodated more.  Our waiter was VERY attentive (I've forgotten his name!  I'm sorry!) and could not have been more helpful.   The absolutely recommend David's for any event you might have!!
1552,"Stopped in for lunch on a lazy, rainy weekday.  Got a window by the table, and started with a couple of cold ones.  Decor is somewhat discombobulated, with differing styles and non-matching elements (I assume they patched up an older restaurant that was here previously, but I'm just guessing).  7 beers on tap, 3 of which were local; my beer could have been colder, but I'll let that slide.  Waitress super friendly and (mostly) quick, another plus.  Bread served was garlic knots - with some of the best garlic topping I've had in ages - really tasty!  Mussels of the day appetizer was top notch; the broth that it came in was terrific, with perfectly cooked mussels.    

For entrees, my wife chose the pork with maple mashed sweet potatoes and spinach.  The entire dish was well conceived and tasty.  We both enjoyed the mixture of savory and sweet (baked apple was also part of the dish).  Duck breast was perfectly prepared - medium rare - although placed over white rice seemed like a bit of a ""cop out.""  Still, the flavor was dead on good and the meat cooked correctly.  Nice tasting dishes.  This was, overall, a terrific lunch experience.  Nicely done, David's."
1553,"Traveled to Portland (Maine) for our two-day Christmas shopping marathon.  We tried David's for the first time and were extremely  happy.  Three of the four of us had the haddock with ""peekie toe"" crab, with spinach and fingerling potatoes and a wonderful romesco sauce.  The other one had the salmon with maple glaze served over mashed sweet potatoes with a side of pan fried Brussels sprouts served al dente -    perfect.  Both dishes were excellent.  Everyone cleaned his or her plate.  We will definitely go back the net time we are in town."
1554,"Everyone knows that Portland has become one of the best cities in the country for restaurants. And while there are a lot of great new restaurants, I have come to one that has been around since the early 1900s. This is an authentic Maine experience. No fake. Nothing related to Asian fusion. Lol

Ambience is authentic. Service is spectacular. Food is memorable. #VisitThisPlace"
1555,"Seafood and diner type food at decent prices. Huge portions and I think the fish was swimming in the Atlantic just this morning. 

I first ate here 32 or so years ago (ouch, that really makes me feel old) and the general atmosphere and food hasn't changed.

Too crowded for me in the tourist season, glad they are open in the off season for us locals"
1556,"Porthole is one of my favorite summer spots because you can't beat the outdoor deck/patio. For one, it's huge and facing the ocean! There are two bars on the back patio facing the water and a few picnic tables for seating. There is almost always live music playing and it's just a great spot to hang out. Drinks are cheap and the lines are not long. Service is friendly inside and outside. The food is average pub food with a heavy influence of seafood (mussels, lobster rolls, fish and chips, scallops, swordfish, haddock). It's not too expensive, but it really shouldn't be for the ""yeah it was okay"" experience. I typically go for the nachos or chicken fingers with fries. Salads and sandwiches are on the menu too.

Really it's all about having a couple drinks on the back patio and listening to the band on a Saturday/Sunday afternoon."
1557,"Has an awesome outside patio for the summer. Inside has a very large bar and some tables. There's a back room where they do private events.

They have a fair amount of beers on tap. Lobster rolls are good. And reasonably priced. It was $19 compared to the restaurant next door which was in the 30s. You can either have butter, lemon aioli or mayo on your lobster roll. Comes with chips or hon can pay extra for fries or onion rings. 

Worth checking out. Especially in summer."
1558,"Don't let appearances deceive you. This place is in kind of a sketchy side alley and parking is tight. From the outside, you could easily pass it by, but don't! It may look a little divey inside, but it's clean, and the staff are friendly. The menu has a nice variety without being too large. I ordered the seared scallops, and my friend ordered the fish and chips (which was an all you can eat special, we were told). Food came out fast and hot. My scallops were cooked to perfection, sweet and tender. The mango salsa that came in top of my greens was underwhelming, and needed some salt and acid to brighten it up, but I didn't order the dish for that. My friend's dish came with a huge fillet of haddock (or cod, I honestly don't remember) that was fried golden and perfect. It was a lot of food, and needless to say he didn't partake in the second order of fish that was offered. We both left stuffed and happy, without spending a lot of money. Sketchy location, but hidden gem, definitely!"
1559,"The Porthole is an outstanding place to grab traditional Maine seafood.  There is a large outdoor patio with picnic table seating along with a big bar area.  There was live music rocking out around lunch time and a great vibe.  We got seated quickly right after a brief storm - no wait.

The food here was simple and delicious.  We shared the fried seafood platter ($28). The seafood was so fresh that it blew other restaurants out of the water.  The huge portion of shrimp, scallops, crab cake and clams was delicious!  The meat was cooked perfectly and the awesome batter was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  We also split a tasty lobster roll for only $18 (vs $25+ elsewhere).  There was a generous portion of claw and tail meat doused in butter and served on a excellent griddled hot dog bun.  The crispy fries were excellent and the onion rings were a surprise treat!

Check this place out to get some awesome seafood at great prices!"
1560,"This is a great place to get food. There is food for those who don't want to eat sea food too. I have had several dishes here and it was all good. 

1) Location is right downtown on the water. You probably want to bring a jacket if you go at night because it's breezy and a little chilly.

2) If you sit outside make sure that your lower back can handle it as there are no chairs with backs.

3) The fish tacos with fries are great. The Mayo on them was really good and the shells were nice. The fries were nice and crisp. Would order again. 

4) The lobster platter was good. Well the lobster part was. My potato was not cooked all the way through. I was happy the the lobster meat was seweet though. 

5) Bathrooms were clean. 

For those who are noise sensitive, it is very loud as there is a lot of live music. Same applies for the hard or hearing. Overall it was a good experience."
1561,"We were in Portland for a couple of days and tried several fish and chips platters and lobster rolls... here we had the clam chowder, twin lobsters AND fish and chips (we stuffed ourselves!) And left happy!"
1562,"Visiting Portland for a government conference. A group of 20 went to the Porthole.  I ordered a bowl of clam chowder. It was a bowl of milk with a few tough clams and a few diced potatoes. Very runny consistency with no flavor. I was very disappointed. 
As my entree I ordered the fried combo. Again very disappointing the clams were dark and tasted like burnt flour, they were so over cooked the clam taste was gone. The shrimp were frozen pre-breaded something you would expect at red lobster. The scallops were very small and tasted like shark fin plugs. Definitely were not fresh scallops from these waters. Sad thing is the locals say the place is great. It's marginal at best. Their competitors Gilberts has ten times better food. I'll be going there tomorrow if I can."
1563,"I had friends visiting for just a few hours and they were looking for a fun place to eat, drink and enjoy Portland.  The sun was shining and so I suggested The Porthole and the outside deck.  It was the perfect day to be sitting outside and on the water.

The staff was very kind and attentive to getting us set up at our table/high top.  Our server was not new to The Porthole but her first day serving, so she was nervous.  We assured her that we would be a good group to start with and to relax.

She was awesome and so was the food.  Two of us had the lobster roll which was larger than expected and so yummy.  The fries were great too!  My other friends at the tuna meal and a turkey club, which they enjoyed.  The whole experience was perfect and just what we needed.

My friends think I rock because of the experience and all I had to do was pick the location!  Thanks"
1564,"Yes, Yes Yes!  You must eat here when in Portland!  After traveling all through New England for two weeks, it was the best price on lobster we found.  You can get two (twin) lobsters for $24.95!  We ordered two twin lobster dinners for 3 people and it was just the right amount of food. They are set right on the harbor and have outside seating.  There is usually a band playing.  It's a great place to eat!"
1565,"I found this this place after doing a quick search for places in Maine seen on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. After reading several of the reviews on The Porthole, I was skeptical in terms of what to expect, however, I'm happy to report on my visit, they knocked it out of the park.

The weather was perfect so we decided to dine on the outdoor patio. It was crowded but there was no wait. We had lunch around 2:00. 

Excellent selection of local beers.

We started with the steamers. OMG. Delicious!

For the entree we went with the twin lobster special. $25 for 2, 1 & 1/4 pound Maine Lobsters. We shared the plate so there was a $5 share plate fee but it's still a deal at that price. We were both pleased with this meal. 

Apparently, as I've read in other reviews, they run out of lobster so there is a chance you might now be able to get the deal. I bring this up because our waitress told us we got the last two Lobsters. 

Overall great experience. The service was top notch. I would absolutely return to The Porthole."
1566,"Fresh as can be... 
Watched em pull the lobster off the boat. We had three couples ordering different items and everyone was pleased with their meal"
1567,"Amazing crab cakes. Crispy fries and lobster rolls!! 

The lobster roll was perfectly cooked, tender, but it could use some more flavor. Didnt really taste the lemon aoli."
1568,"This restaurant BLOWS! There are so many better places to spend your money.
Lousy music, lousy service, and sub par food. Avoid at all costs."
1569,"Breakfast on the water on a beautiful Sunday morning.  Everything was just fine.  I had the Lobster omelette.  Others had breakfast sandwiches.  The views aren't anything special, but it's still nice to be on the water, at a picnic table, relaxed and breathing the fresh salt air.  It looks like it could get real busy during the evenings, but for breakfast it was peaceful and nice."
1570,"I came here to watch a World Cup game cause Ri Ra was totally out of control and I really needed to eat some lunch and sit somewhere. This was close by and I was able to sit at the bar, so perfect, right.

I ordered a coffee (cause I'm not drinking) and after much deliberation, I decide on the beer battered fish sandwich, thinking it wouldn't be as insanely huge as fish and chips.

Which was... maybe half true.

The service was pretty solid, and the bartender kept my coffee flowing pretty good. The food itself took maybe 30 mins to come out, but I wasn't in a huge rush, and there were a ton of people outside.

The fish sandwich was solid, but unspectacular. It could definitely use a little more tartar sauce. But at like $10 or whatever I paid, it was solid.

Then the bartender was like ""hey no rush but here's the check."" Which basically felt to me like ""no rush but yeah gtfo you're not ordering beer."" Fair enough I guess.

So I ended up watching the second half at Ri Ra with about a pound of fish sitting in my stomach, which is a great way to make new friends, I reckon.

Either way, solid meal, very affordable, decent-ish service, but I felt rushed to gtfo since I wasn't drinking."
1571,If I could give this dump zero stars I would without hesitation.  Just because it's warm in your area does not mean that everybody will think that it's warm.  I was on a business trip to Massachusetts. I drove to Portland for the day over the weekend.  Both front doors were open causing a cold cross draft inside the seating area very chilly. When our food arrived at the table half of it was cold and non-appealing to consume. The gal who waited on us had very poor people skills. It makes me wonder how she makes a living at waiting tables. The food was mediocre at best with no lasting memories of being a stellar pub. I wouldn't go racing back to The Porthole Pub anytime soon!!
1572,"I came here sober so maybe that's my problem. It was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon - complete with several bachelorette parties in various stages of inebriation.  Music is Top 40 / 90s-2000s hits. A live band came on a few times and did a few covers which was cool.

Drink specials were good. A can of beer was 3 bucks. They take CC which is a plus and offered to start a tab. No thanks. This is the last place I'd start a tab (tons of people / busy bar = mistaken charges galore at my expense).

The women's bathroom by the front bar has only 2 stalls and luckily I got there before a line formed. The stall next to me was occupied by a few girls from a bachelorette party who were in the crying / I love you so much stage so I knew I had to hustle since they clearly weren't coming out for awhile.   

Crowd was a good mix of 20s, 30s and older people having a good time. Our friend is from Portland and said usually this place is a high school reunion for him. Translation: a place most people would go out of their way to avoid."
1573,"This is a nice little spot. Right on the water. Walked in and was greeted and seated. Polite, friendly staff. 
Our server came by and I got a local brew from Shipyard. A red ale. Pretty tasty. 
I had never had a lobster roll before, so I was determined to try it while in Maine. 
But first, got a appetizer of Bangs Island Mussels, which are described as:Sauteed in white wine, garlic, butter, fresh thyme, chick peas, cherry tomatoes and lemon. Served with grilled bread.
THE FOOD:
Maybe due to how it was described on the menu, I expected more flavor from the Bangs Island Mussels,  I mean, they were good...and I liked the chick peas, but I didn't taste the thyme, wine, or garlic. The mussels were good, just expected more. 
The Lobster Roll was also good. I love lobster, and being my first roll, I didn't know it was cold. All in all, it was good, but I probably should have just had a whole lobster. 
I would eat here again. Nice place, nice people. I saw the server giving people instructions how to get all the meat from a lobster. Good job."
1574,"Beware if you go through the bar area and decide to sit indoors at an empty table.  No signs or staff tell you that you have to check in with the hostess first who is outside at another entrance.  We flagged down a waitress (who passed our table a few times) who finally told us we had to check in with the Hostess. Waited 30 minutes for our name to be called (while sitting at the table we chose inside).  Hostess came in, called our name and gave us menus and water at the table we sat at the entire time.  Told us she will find our waitress, who was MIA most of the time.

Got excited when I saw the huge plates of food at the next table. They ordered a sandwich club and fries. They were big enough to share. Pretty good for $10.  Got our food 30 minutes later and was disappointed. Ordered the fried full belly clams for $20. Got like 12 clams and 20 fries.  My husband ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings and that was sad too. Fish was good but bread was stale and onion rings were over cooked.  Didn't bother complaining since it probably wouldn't make a difference anyway.

Guess I expected too much. Oh well, won't be back here again since there are many other options around Portland."
1575,"There are a lot of different factors that play into this rating, so let me break it down...

5 stars for their patio deck! The Porthole is a staple for summer time and good weather, as they have an expansive patio overlooking the water. The patio has a bar, but their inside bar is also easily accessed if the outdoor bar gets too busy. They have daily specials for their drinks, so always take a look at what they have to offer as far as deals. They frequently host bands or other local talent to play on their patio, which also adds to that summertime feel. 

3 stars for their food. The Porthole also serves a variety of pub fare, whether you sit inside or outside on the deck. Again, the patio deck is the main attraction, so if you are looking to eat outside, this might be a great option, however, the food is just good at best. I typically order a wrap sandwich and fries, however, when I have brought people here, they have tried the lobster roll, and again, it was just good. Nothing spectacular, but nothing awful either. 

2 stars for service. When I say service, I mean the food service, not the bar service. If I were to rate the bar service, it would probably be more 4 or 5 stars, however, I find the food service very different. On numerous occasions, I have had poor service when dining here. Most times, I have found that our table is barely noticed or cared for, and that we have to actively seek out our waiter/waitress if we need something. On many occasions, food has been brought out and someone's food was forgotten. The service always tends to be consistent...but not in a good way. 

Overall, I appreciate the Porthole and I definitely frequent here a lot during the warm summer months for drinks and the deck. If you are looking for some drinks with a good atmosphere, then this place is prime. If you are looking for food and good service, I would look elsewhere."
1576,"We found The Porthole by accident; we were looking for other nearby options when the wait for lunch at Gilbert's Chowder House (next door) was going to be really long (it was a gorgeous noontime in late July). The Porthole happened to have great seats right by the water, which gave us the chance to watch lobster boats going in and out of the harbor. My husband and I ordered IPAs to drink (Founders and the local Lone Pine) and I also had a nice cup of clam chowder. For my entree, I had the lobster-stuffed baked potato, which hit the spot and was only $10.95. My husband enjoyed the fish & chips and our 15yo son was able to get his favorite: clam strips. The prices are definitely cheaper than at Gilbert's, and there's more variety on the menu than just fried seafood, e.g the potato that I had, nachos, a marinated beet salad (that I will *have* to try next time), and a cilantro-lime mahi-mahi over black bean salad and mixed greens. We'll be back next summer for sure!"
1577,"I love the deck at the Porthole in the summer! Live music on Sundays until 6pm. There is always a great crowd and some sort of drink special. You can stand and mingle and drink or you can grab a table and get a bite to eat. I have only eaten here a few times, but it has always been good with good portions and prices."
1578,"I am middle of the road on this place.

We came in during the snow over the weekend, they seemed like they were getting ready to close down for the night.  They did let us put in an order to go.  They staff was friendly while we waited for our food.

We go our food home, the potato skin was kinds of wrinkled like it was an older potato with spots cut out of it where buds may have started to grow on the potato.  The lobsters were not bring red either and looked like they may not have been the absolute freshest.  But I do feel that I could give this restaurant another try on my next visit to Portland and the food will be of better quality.  I think I may have just had bad timing with this place.  We will see in a few months if I can update my review with better ratings."
1579,"We came here for my 35th Birthday. I was able to get a full 1.25lb lobster dinner for only $19! Couldn't even believe it! Very friendly waitress staff, and great choices for beer or drinks to go along with dinner. Great Portland atmosphere."
1580,"Another typical sports bar. Can't comment on the food as we just grabbed a beer. GREAT drink prices during happy hour, some of the best that we've seen in the city. Service was quick and attentive. It just wasn't anything special or memorable, but a great quick stop to get out of the cold and grab a beer."
1581,"Run of the mill seafood wharf eatery. Very causal and laid back setting. Certainly don't dress up to come here. It's a bit of a dive bar. The prices are better than most restaurant though. All 7 of us enjoyed our food from the giant tuna melt to twin lobster dinner to shrimp cocktail to beet salad. Quality food, no bells or whistles. It was honestly a bit refreshing considering how trendy many restaurants in the area can try to be at times. 

Waitress wasn't as attentive as we needed her to be. Only 1 person got a water refill our whole meal. She seemed more focused on alcohol refills. She was MIA most of the time we were there aside from ordering and delivering items. The place was empty except for us and one other couple. The floor was also sticky. I would come back here again and give it another try."
1582,"My visit took place on a Saturday afternoon. This place was FUN. We were met by security to take a look into my bag then allowed on through. We ordered our beers at a window attached to the restaurant and were served promptly by extremely friendly and smiley staff. 

The deck was crowded as a live band was playing. This band kept the place lively and were extremely talented. 

The deck is also pet friendly! We met several friendly doggos who were also enjoying the atmosphere!

Gorgeous views, cold brews, live music and friendly faces...what more could we ask for?? 

We did not order any food, but it smelled great passing us!"
1583,"A couple locals actually recommended The Porthole for a good lobster roll. I would have just thought it was a tourist trap and not gone near it if it wasn't for their recommendation. There is a decent amount of outdoor seating with a water view (not the best water view, but there isn't spectacular ones at most restaurants in Portland). 

I got the lobster roll and it was fine, but overall it just didn't taste as fresh as the highroller lobster roll that I had the day earlier. It was just OK and I felt that I had better, fresher tasting ones even in Boston."
1584,"The shrimp Alfredo was the best I've ever had but the not worth $19, the portion size was extremely small and I left hungry. We waited over 40 minutes to get our food, even though it wasn't very busy."
1585,"We weren't expecting anything too extravagant but had higher expectations based on prior reviews.

Upon being sat, our server started things off in a tone that had us wondering if we should just go somewhere else.

- I asked what the Chef's Veggie was. She had no idea what I was talking about so I pointed it out under the steak dinner. She immediately told me not to order the steak, it's disgusting. She then went on to tell me that whatever the veggie was, it wasn't worth ordering because it was likely a frozen veggie that they would throw in the microwave
- the ""catch of the day"" appears to always be pollock so I would recommend naming it in the menu rather than making it appear as though you could experience something different at another visit
- when I asked if I could sub fries for a veggie, I was told it was an upcharge of $2 - that's a little overpriced considering they are serving frozen food
- the advertised Maine cut fries are nothing more than frozen fries
- the fish came over cooked
- the restrooms were disgusting and not well maintained 

*the onion rings were tasty 

Perhaps it's a good place to have a couple of drinks, but I wouldn't recommend it for eating. Spend a few bucks more and hit up one of their competitors in the neighborhood"
1586,"I don't know why this place gets poor reviews. Maybe we should set up expectations: 
-Are you looking for a fine dining experience? If yes, look elsewhere. If no, keep reading.
-Do you want to feel like you're eating somewhere the fishermen that just came off the boats would eat? If yes, keep reading. If no, look elsewhere.
-Do you value a good deal? If yes, keep reading. If no, look elsewhere.

Now that we have that out of the way, the Porthole was awesome. It looked like a seafood restaurant on the wharf should look. Mismatched tables and chairs, a worn floor, old timey marine decor, and just the right amount of kitsch. 

We didn't realize they close at 7 pm on Sunday nights since Yelp and Google both told us 8 pm was closing. Nevertheless, we didn't once feel rushed because we were there 15 minutes past close. 

The food was great. They were out of the lobster for two deal, unfortunately. But the lobster alfredo and the lobster roll more than made up for it. We also had the crab cakes as an app and they were delicious.

My only complaint would be the price, but we had lobster in the off season and we walked away full bellied and left a fat tip for the awesome service we received. 

Do yourself a favor and give this place a chance."
1587,"You can't beat the warf-side ambiance of Portholes nor the twin lobster meal for $25.00. Seating is slow which can be jarring because no one seems to be in charge; hello, I'm over here, that said, I'd go again."
1588,"Really delicious food!! My friend and I are visiting from Florida and were told we had to try this place! Very friendly staff, and we both highly recommend the lobster spinach artichoke dip. (:"
1589,"If I could leave a zero, I would. Come here if you want to be ignored.

Waited 20 minutes to be seated after being told there was no wait. Hostess accidentally forgot we were waiting, while we were right in front her.

Then we sat down and waited another half hour while the server ignore our table, passing by us at least three times and not making eye contact. Having worked in the industry before, waited patiently. However, when people seated after us were being served drinks and checked on, and they had not even walked over, it became apparent they would not come. The one girl server who kept ignoring us looked over while at the drink station laughing. At that point, we decided to leave. Just rude. I should have read the reviews before opting for convenience of a water front restaurant.

On the plus side, we ended up at the restaurant right next door, Boone's. They had a wonderful patio deck, with excellent and friendly service. The oysters and lobsters we ordered were delicious and fresh. Don't waste your time at Porthole. Go next door. And after that we also went to Lobster and Co., and again, great service and excellent lobster and great beer. So to reemphasize, don't settle for less...skip Porthole and enjoy the wonderful restaurants nearby!"
1590,"I feel like The Porthole is kind of a hole-in-the-wall. My friend and I took a mini trip to Portland in July without planning too much and ended up here after a while of searching Yelp for a spot that would give us the full Portland experience. We came here on a Saturday and were told there was a 45 minute wait for outdoor seating. But, we ended up getting seated 5 minutes later at a table right by the water. We ordered buffalo chicken wings, fettuccine alfredo, and fish and chips. The food took at least 45 minutes to arrive and wasn't the best. What made up for the experience was the live music, views, and atmosphere. I don't think I'd return here just because the wait did eat up a large chunk of our day, but if you've got time to hang out for a while I'd give this place a try."
1591,"I've had quite a bit of seafood before, and here I finally had my first infamous New England lobster roll, few oysters AND some of my friends full lobster. Honestly it was all solid but I didn't find any of it too remarkable, if I went again I would recommend full lobster! This place is an awesome venue though so if it's a nice day out you can't go wrong here, and our sever Emily was pretty awesome too"
1592,I agree with some of the less desirable reviews unfortunately. Took forever to get a menu let alone a drink. The staff seemed more interested at bickering at each other rather than customer service. Especially waiter who was in particular rude to co workers. So the meal arrives. Clams for me and shrimp for the Wife. Way over done. Rubber constituency feel to it. While eating the meal I thought. How could this be this sub par?  We're in Maine!!!  Overall disappointed. Maybe try again but who knows. Won't rush back.
1593,"What can I say other than this is a watering hole for terrible service.  I ordered a pitcher of beer and found a bottle cap in it.  Rather than apologizing they accused us of putting it in the  pitcher. Three different people three different reasons for it being in there. ""Oh you've had friends visiting your table (none of which were drinking corona light) so we can't say how it got there"", "" you drank a lot of it so what do you want us to do about it"" oh my and my favorite, ""you had a Corona at the bar!"" They serve the corona without the cap on!!!!!!  The point of brining it to their attention was not for free drinks, simple that the recognize a sanity issue.  I don't know how many rats ran over the bottles before they served me beer in a dirty pitcher. The Porthole has certainly fallen far and fast.

Moral of this review...make sure you thoroughly review your pitchers before you pour the beer."
1594,"Loved this morning's special Lobster Rockport breakfast!!!!!  Biscuit was so flakey, the lobster meat was plentiful & creamy sauce was to dip for, like over & over again until I cleaned my plate spotless...."
1595,"Worst lobster roll ever! No taste or mouthwatering experience...just bar food cooking that probably tastes good when you're drunk!

Skip this place and find another lobster roll elsewhere!"
1596,I ate here on 10/10 for lunch and had my first lobster roll ever! Was huge but delicious! The service was excellent and friendly.
1597,"Alright, so before I came to visit Portland I asked around and tried to get the BEST lobster roll recommendation. Several people said that The Porthole was up there and so I put it at the top of my list.

Well...my friends and I got there pretty late after a long day of drinking and not much eating on a Friday. The bartender said the kitchen was closed, but she let us put our order in anyways (so nice!!). We ordered 3 lobster rolls and three beers and when the food came out, it wasn't there for long. The lobster roll was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the freshest lobster I've ever had in my life. It was crunchy and perfect. I'll give you the disclaimer we were all pretty drunk and I haven't had many lobster rolls to compare this one too, but we enjoyed it a lot. The fries were pretty good too.

Loved the casual feel of the place and I've heard the deck is great too. If I lived any closer, I would be there all the time."
1598,"This one is short and sweet. Come here, get some beer and get the twin lobsters maybe some clam chowder. Literally this is what Maine was meant for. Also sit on the porch out back and watch the boats!"
1599,This was our first restaurant visit on our first day to Portland Maine. Found it on Guy Fieri's list of restaurants to check out. The lobster roll did not disappoint. Sat outside watching lobster boats come in with their catch and enjoyed the most delicious fresh Lobster on a brioche bun that you could ever imagine. The food the atmosphere was perfect to start our exploration of this city
1600,"It was a REALLY rainy Mothers Day and after hopping from 3 other different locations in the area that wouldn't be able to comfortably accommodate a party of 7 with 3 children we chose this location. 

We came in between Lunch and Dinner so the place was pretty much empty. The decor is very dated with tiles tearing from the floor but with all the seating available indoor and outdoor it was obvious this place is probably rockin in the Summer months. 

It was our first time getting to explore Maine so of course we had to order Lobster. My Husband and Son ordered the twin lobster deal and I got a Lobster Roll....The food was delicious! 

Our server was super sweet and accommodating. 

I took away a star because my cousins whom we were traveling with tried ordering the twin lobster deal for her children to split and once our waitress heard that was their plan she informed them that there would be an additional $5.00 added the meal due to the kids sharing it. I thought that was pretty cheap ... I mean come on, it's all going to the same place. Unfortunately it forced them to skip out on ordering lobsters for the kids. So we shared some of ours. 

If you want to order the twin lobster deal and plan to share it to cut the cost, I recommend NOT telling them you're going to be sharing so they don't up charge you. 

Otherwise the place was a okay."
1601,"The only place that makes homemade hash in my hometown closed a few months ago so, needless to say, when we heard about the hash at the Porthole we just had to check it out. Oh boy...the Porthole is our new favorite place for hash.  This not your traditional ground up hash. Delicious bites of sweet potato, green pepper, and corned beef filled the plate. So worth the stop!!!"
1602,"Went in for drinks on the deck, ended up also ordering lobster nachos. Perfect snacks, nice big plate, great for sharing. Nice outdoor area with umbrellas."
1603,"I stopped here for a quick bite while on vacation one afternoon.  This place screamed tourist trap at first, but the outdoor seating area was too good to pass up.

The beer was nice and cold.  And right before our food came out a thunderstorm passed through.  The staff was really good about helping rush everyone into the indoor dining area.

I was not expecting the food to be good, but it was very tasty!  I had the fish tacos and they were creative and delicious.  And my husband's fish and chips tasted great too.

Overall, a bit touristy, but the food was good enough to absolutely consider going back again!"
1604,"Heard about this place a lot so i had to check it out.
I was not that impressed to be honest.
I Ordered the lobster roll and the twin lobster dinner.
Lobster roll was really mediocre and not satisfying at all.
The roll was almost empty there was really small amount of lobster in it.
Lobster was good but I think its the season (as it was too warm summer) so i think the lobsters are not that meaty."
1605,"If you're looking to experience Maine lobster, come here. They have an amazing ""twin lobster"" deal, which is two 1-1.5lb (quoting our server) lobsters for just $24.95. The lobsters are so fresh and cooked perfectly.

On the other hand, the rest of their food is just okay. Pretty bland, actually. The scallops are overcooked, but the portion is large and mango salsa is yummy (which also goes great with the lobster). The clam chowder is pretty good. The lobster bisque lacks flavor and is too creamy, but it has a good amount of lobster meat.

Service was excellent. Very friendly and attentive servers. I can't remember the guy's name, but he took great care of our table of 6."
1606,"Cool atmosphere with large deck on water, went there for breakfast and had the cornbeef hash, awesome 

Wife got lobster omelett, $24 bucked and didnt see or taste a single piece of lobster, thinking chef forgot to add it.

Cool place to visit"
1607,"What an amazing patio this spot has. It is nearly endless, and completely on the water. I came here with a dozen dudes on a Saturday night and there was a great crowd of people partying. There was a DJ in the middle of the patio and large crowds dancing their butts off. Two big bars are accessible from the patio. The beer list is a decent size, with lots of local beer options. While we were there, a party boat pulled right up and it was an awesome touch to the experience. I highly recommend this place for large groups who want to have a great time."
1608,"Typical example of a ""tourist trap.""  But it got us this time.  Service was horrible, my friend had a lobster roll with a burned roll and, as far as we can tell, frozen lobster -- in Portland, Maine?  I don't think so.  Not when fresh is everywhere in the a
On top of that, an obvious ""out of stater"" was changing a baby ON THE TABLE.  We mentioned it to the manager who was horrified that (1) we noticed, because he said his staff didn't; and (2) we objected to it, because he said we were the only ones complaining.  OH, and ""the table is sterilized"".  If his staff never noticed THIS, they obviously weren't paying attention to the customers either.
Everyone I've talked with in the Portland area actually laughed when we told them where we ate, from the manager of the flea market, to old-time friends.
As another reviewer has said, I'd give it a ""0"" if that were available.  And sadly, so many of the tourists think it's a great place to get seafood.  Try the fisherman's co-op at Pine Pint for half the price, and many times the quality."
1609,"Dined on a Tuesday evening and the wait was about 15 minutes. A friend and I came with my yellow lab and the outdoor seating area is dog friendly so we sat at a picnic table that appeared to be attached to another one. Prior to being seated the hostess did ask if we minded ""sharing"" a table with two others and it did not bother us. Two really nice men on business were our table mates and we're both lab owners so all was good.

We shared the same lovely waitress who adored dogs and as she answered questions for our tablemates we eves dropped so she wouldn't have to repeat it all.

It was our turn and we decided to share the twin boiled lobster for $25 (2 sides 1/2 ear of corn, a roll and asked to substitute roasted red potatoes with fries and our waitress said that was doable with a $1-2 up-charge) and the seared scallops served with roasted potatoes and a mango salsa over mixed greens $22.  Tap water for drinks.

The scallops were of nice size, cooked to perfection however only 4 came with the order which is ridiculous for the $22 price. Everything else with this dish was delicious.

Twin lobsters were a fair size, it did come with the roasted red potatoes instead of fries but when our waitress returned, we reminded her and she gladly requested it from the kitchen. The red potatoes and corn were ""meh"", lobster was tasty and average tenderness. It took the fries a little longer to arrive and when they did, they were piping hot but standard frozen, not handcut. We were not up-charged for the fries possibly because our waitress forgot.

Overall, the dinner was good, nothing special to rave about but the waitstaff were all wonderful... all stopping by to say ""hi"" to our lab.

Recommended if you have a pet you would like to dine with in Old Port! Thanks for being so welcoming to our ""kid""!"
1610,"Solid 3.5 stars so round up. We came for lunch on a Sunday and it was really busy but it was worth the wait. We sat outside and ordered fish and chips, the clams and fish tacos and clam chowder. My favorite was the fish and chips. It was fried well and the fish was juicy. Their fries were really good too. The clam chowder was cold and the server offered to bring a new bowl but we were starving and didn't want to bother.
Prices weren't bad at all considering it's in a hot tourist spot. Our server was friendly and efficient."
1611,"Pretty large lobster roll served on what looked like split texas toast.  I had mine with lemon aioli.  The roll was very good.  Lots and lots of lobster in there, overflowing even.  The fries were pretty good and there were some decent beers on special for $2.50.  All of the lobster rolls are served cold.  They made an exception for my sister and made a warm roll.  I think prefer them warm.   I substituted french fries for the chips.  Fries were good, beer battered style fries.  

Onion rings are battered in cornmeal.  Very good onion rings.  Some of the best that I've had in a long time.

$25 twin lobster dinner is a steal and probably what I should have gotten.  I got a taste of a friend's lobster, and it was sweet a delicious.  Served with potatoes and corn. 

Fair prices, sitting out of the pier during warm months, and good food make this a good recommendation for lunch or dinner on the water. Service was quick even on busy Sunday."
1612,"We had the Whole Maine Lobster which comes with corn on the cob, whole potatoes and roll.  Both were quite large and delicious.  I love the entire lobster since the meat in the body is so much softer and sweeter than the tail.  I love it all.  Didn't even eat the potato or roll.  The corn was sweet and fresh.  it's a down to earth port restaurant, nothing fancy, but served our purpose, LOBSTER!  No complaints here."
1613,"My wife and I came here to Maine on vacation 2 years ago. We did quite a bit of research on the best Maine lobster and it kept coming back to here.

Delicious lobster and such great service! Beautiful view of the water as well. I highly recommend stopping by here when going through Maine!"
1614,"The absolute best! Try the biscuits and the blueberry pancakes!!!!!!!!! You will not be sorry!!
We drove from Colorado and we will be back!!!"
1615,On tour and you find a Twin lobster special for $25..... duh!!!! No brainer! It's not life changing but you are getting bang for your buck! My server was wonderfully kind! I wish the ambiance were better. That's my only gripe! Worth it!
1616,Awesome live music and spot on the water. Great place to enjoy the afternoon with their drink specials. Drinks could be bigger.
1617,"This place is fine. Nothing fancy and nothing special. Your mother will definitely think it is ""scuzzy.""  Keep your order simple (boiled lobster, sweared scallops) and you will not be disappointed. Prices are pretty good. The location is great."
1618,"Excellent service was there a couple days ago on a trip from Philadelphia, a travel guide with an advertisement for this place is what made us visit it. A wonderful twin Lobster lunch, excellent chicken wings. Highly recommended for any outside Traveller visiting Portland"
1619,Amazing lobster! They had a great staff and a lively outside seating area. Highly recommended for a weekend lunch with friends.
1620,Food was super good! a little touristy but good for what we were looking for. We got the lobster roll with different sauces and both were amazing. atmosphere was very nice and we got the full portland experience. I gave it 4 stars because we hardly saw our waitress.
1621,"Love this place but I am not crazy about the service nor their seating policy - showed up at 4:30 for a table when my party was 20 min late and host refused to seat me until everyone was here. I asked to be seated at a small table by myself but was told no?! Sorry but Portland has plenty of other bars to frequent so unless you want rude, slow service don't come here"
1622,"Definitely a great place to grab drinks/beers. Always packed in the summer and weekends. It's pretty sweet, it's essentially a dock on the water. I've eaten here once and that'll probably be my last. Not the biggest fan of the food but maybe I chose a bad night or dish. If your in Portland you def need to make a stop at the Porthole for a drink"
1623,"Arrived at hostess stand, witnessing a waitress having a disagreement re: table availability with another patron, which was handled very poorly. The apparent hostess, someone else, came to us...greeting us with obvious reservation. With a little kindness, she offers us a table next to water per our request. Took about 10 minutes to be offered water by sweet Krista. Ordered ""chowda."" It was good, but not life changing by any means. Then ordered the mussels as suggested. Had to ask for bread to sop up broth. The bread arrived stale as stale as stale as hell! Oh well, no broth enjoyment. Asked for check to move on..."
1624,This place was awesome.On the water and decent prices. The fish tacos were fresh and delicious. We will definitelybe back.
1625,"Must love wasps. We arrived and decided to sit outside. Ordered breakfast. We noticed a yellow jacket wasp buzzing around our table. Not good. We mentioned it to the waitstaff and they agreed it was a problem. When the food arrived my order was wrong. When the correct order came out it really wasn't hot. Then the yellow jackets came in bunches. We moved inside (carried our own plates). Waited for more coffee. 

The food was good, but the service was lacking. If you open the deck for seating the waitstaff should be able to handle the load.  I'll have to consider my options before returning to this establishment."
1626,"If you are a farm boy from PA this is the place to go.
Food and service was great.
This is what I totally expected when we decided to go to Maine for a quick get away.
If we ever make it back we will hit this place every time."
1627,"Had the lobster roll with lemon aioli. Wasn't too bad nor was it nothing to rave about. Went on a Thursday night and the restaurant was rather busy. Service took a bit as it seemed they only had one waitress working the outside. Eventually either more showed up, or the inside bar was not busy and they began to help. Be a nice place to check out the live music and get a beer or two to start your night."
1628,"We came at lunch time exhausted and hot from the humidity and walking around all early afternoon and waited too long to be seated. The waitresses walked back and forth passing us and didn't even say a word. Two of us from or party sat ourselves in their casual outdoor patio on a picnic table, and when the hostess/server came over finally, she rudely told us to read the sign that said ""Please wait to be seated"" and wouldn't seat us. We left disappointed by the lack of Maine hospitality that we love so much. She didn't even say thank you for waiting and really lacked any politeness or customer service skills. I recommend going to Boone's next door for delicious food, shady and quaint patio seating, and REAL customer service."
1629,"My wife and I are visiting Portland for a few days and eating around town. This restaurant is wonderful. We were recommended to come here while drinking at the Thirsty Pig, also an awesome place to stop. A great environment, we ate on the patio on the harbor, awesome service, and great food!"
1630,First time in Portland and stopped at porthole last night to get a lobster roll.  We were not impressed!  It had no flavor  Reminded me of eating a rice cake.  Try another place for a lobster roll
1631,"The fish taco are hard shell, barely any fish and just missing something. Friendly staff."
1632,"Excellent food, excellent service be sure to get Taylor she's a great server! And try the beer battered fish!!"
1633,"Great food. Reasonably priced. There was a live band the night we went and the people watching atmosphere is incredible. 
The place kind of has that ""dive bar"" feeling, if you know what I mean. We all ordered the ""twin lobsters,"" several drinks, and a couple appetizers. The appetizers were good. The drinks (grey goose and tonic) were served in plastic cups and generally pretty weak. I usually feel a little tipsy after 2 and I had 4 and felt completely fine. Small cup, lots of ice, little vodka. The waitress was a little sassy, kind of your typical new-England Boston type lady. She wasn't exactly helpful, a little rude, a little rough around the edges. The more we ordered the nicer she became. Our group really enjoys fresh vegetables with our meals and that is just not an option at this place. You can read other reviews and see this is an ongoing theme at this place.

If you are looking for a little dive place with fresh lobster and good music this is it. Definitely not a fancy place. Not the best service."
1634,Service was bad. Food was awful. Kitchen was very slow. I will never come back. Plenty of other good spots in Portland.
1635,"This place probably has the largest outdoor deck in the OldPort area.  We went on a Friday evening and the patio for drinks was packed, but in a goo way!  Tons of beer specials, and overall reasonably priced bar (plus a decent band playing)!  We only had a 30 minute wait for outdoor seating as well, which was great for how busy the place always was.  They have a 2 lobster special for $25.... you will not be able to beat that price!!!! 
One person in our group is vegetarian and he thoroughly enjoyed the nacho app (we all stole some) as well as the veggie burger. 
We went back for mimosa the next morning before going out to the island."
1636,Exactly what you imagine when you close your eyes and imagine a Sleepy New England town. Local musicians in a mic and cold local beers on tap. Don't commercialize this quaint obscure hole in the wall favorite that has been the end of the day refuge for so many for so long.
1637,"The lobster roll was huge and came with a choice of lemon mayo, butter or regular mayo so h earns the place four stars. The atmosphere was very casual and most folks had a beer at 11:30 on a Sunday. They don't serve lunch until noon but were great about allowing us to order lobster rolls earlier."
1638,"There's a lot of cry babies whining and pouting on here, grow up!  Here's what you can do, go to the grocery store, buy a few lobsters, cook them just how you want them (because apparently the way everyone else ate them wasn't good enough for you), and you can serve them to your dumb kids with the perfect disposition (because apparently someone who makes their living waiting tables isn't as good at it as you would be).  What a bunch of idiots!

This place is great, I don't care about what anyone else says.  We had 2 lobsters for $25.00 ($5 extra to share).  First of all - if you're going to complain about the price, you shouldn't be ordering lobsters at restaurants.  This is a nice restaurant, but if you came here, looked around at the customers, decor, and what not, and you expected a fine dining, five star, culinary experience, you're just at the wrong place, or your expectations are that of an entitled twerp.  Second of all - if your problem was with the service, it's because you're a difficult customer.  Can't stand a place being bombarded with reviews from idiots who feel the world is at their mercy.

This place will give you what you pay for.  Good local craft beer and some fresh caught lobster.  I didn't have to put on a three piece suit.  Great view from the deck outside, we actually watched a packed party cruise go out as we sat down!  They actually had a DJ pumping out some hits from the mid 90's.  Brought me back!  Hopefully, god willing, I will be back in Portland Maine, because I will be eating here!"
1639,"Porthole should be awesome given its location, but the view is the only reason I give it even two stars. The food last time we went was atrocious (three separate meals) and the drinks were very below average. Only thing I would go here for is a beer on the deck to hang out. Side note: hang on to your ID because mine has been dropped in the water by the bouncer. Disappointing all around."
1640,"It was my second day in Portland, and I was looking for another place to go eat some lobster. I didn't realize a lot of the restaurants are seasonal, so I was driving around the city, stopping at several places and failing. We came across the Porthole, which was a nice little place. It had a hole in the wall feel to it, but that's coming from someone who doesn't see many places like that. We sat at the bar and were given menus to look over and the specials were explained to us. What I definitely wanted to eat was a lobster roll, and then they had a twin lobster special that caught my eye. Since I had never eaten a whole lobster before, I thought it would be the perfect time for my mom to show me the ways of eating one. 

We ordered the lobster roll with lemon aioli, and this lobster roll gave had the most lobster out of all places that I had a lobster roll during my trip. I definitely didn't complain about that. After I finished the lobster roll with my mom, the two lobsters came out shortly. Eating a whole lobster is fun, and allowed me to experience what it's like. I would have never realized that the claw meat is a lot more tender and less chewy than the tail. Both parts are really good, just be aware of the intestines in the tail! Our server was really nice to us and put the cherry on top of our stay. I definitely recommend giving this a shot when in Portland."
1641,"Best lobster roll I've had hands down. Came here right off my flight and Kristi, my server, was so accommodating and helpful. I was here once before in October at night and enjoyed a live band and some great lobster bisque. Today it was a perfect place to sit in the sun and watch the fishing boats go in and out all the day."
1642,"I was happy with the twin lobster deal for $25.  Simple, easy outdoor seating on a portion of the docks on a beautiful spring evening is a plus.  Reason for the docked star is my wife's fish in chips dinner was disappointing considering this is a seafood restaurant. The battered on the fish was soggy and not cooked correctly.  Maybe deep fryer equipment issues, off day for the chef... who knows, it was disappointing especially if you are trying to feed a preggo wife."
1643,"The hostess told us our wait would be a couple minutes but it was actually 40 minutes so that was disappointing. But once we sat, service was awesome and food came out within 20 minutes. Lobster roll is a MUST TRY here. All food looked amazing and sitting on the deck you have a great view and you can see them polling up the lobster traps!"
1644,"Having lived in Maine for almost a decade, lobster is my absolute favorite food; the $15 ""market price"" was legitimately the worst deal I've ever had for both quality and quantity of lobster.  The entire meal tasted bland and was astoundingly dry.  

While our group's primary waitress was pleasant and attentive, the same cannot be said for every waitress.  I wish we had only one waitress... however, because one of our group had ordered a drink in another section of the pub, one waitress felt it necessary to confront our party over the lack of tip for the drink order.  Albeit a gratuity should have been given for the drink, it was entirely unclear that moving 4 feet would result in a different server, and making customers feel uncomfortable about an honest mistake when her fellow waitress could simply divert $1.05 tip from the $20 tip on a sub $100 tab ($91 + $7 for the separate drink)... it seems confused and smacks of poor customer service.

If you enjoy paying for dry, overpriced lobster, barely recognizable mimosas, and don't mind a confrontational and abrasive waitress: this is absolutely the place to go."
1645,"I absolutely loved this place! I was visiting Portland for the first time and heard this was a must try restaurant. So I went to see what the hype was about, and they did not disappoint. The service was great, the waitresses were very friendly and even brought out water for my dog when we dined on the patio; one waitress recommended some great dog parks to try. I def know when I come back to Portland I will stopping here again, in fact I ate there twice during my stay. 

As for the food itself, it was great. I had the burgers one day and the twin lobsters the next. The lobsters of course were amazing, but the don't sleep on the burgers. It's one of those places where everything looked good, and everyone's plates made you hungry. Try it!"
1646,"If you want an authentic Portland experience, this is the best place to go. Great waterfront atmosphere that highlights some of Maine's working waterfront. Awesome service, drinks, and live music.  No other place in the city begins to compare to the PortHole. They also offer amazing party cruises around Portland's scenic islands aboard 'The Casablanca' where you can dance your butt off to some of the areas best bands."
1647,"Located in Portland Maine, this unique restaurant has a wide variety of seafood on the menu. They had 2 lobsters for $25! Lobsters were fresh and amazing- the best I've ever had. Not too impressed with my first lobster roll here, but everything else was great. Lobster bisque was also superb. My server gladly described their local beers to me. Great food and service here. There is a large outside deck to enjoy your lobster on with a great view of the port. It is conveniently located in the shopping district."
1648,Has a great Dockside historic Bar feel! We were able to bring our chocolate lab out onto the deck which overlooked the harbor and fishing boats bringing in their catch. A very very rustic old bar.
1649,Live music during the Summer is a great time! Enjoy some drinks on their outdoor patio. Food looked good but we didn't try any.
1650,"Have you ever experienced something in your life so indelible that it leaves an imprint in your mind?  I truly believe that food can do this to a person.  Such sentiment could not be truer than the gastronomical experience that I had at Porthole Restaurant & Pub in Portland, Maine.  As my best friend Kar said: ""Eating another lobster will never feel the same way again.""  I wholeheartedly agree with him.  Now I've had my fill of lobsters at different establishments around the world, but this unassuming pub served up one of the most delicious and fresh steamed lobster I have ever had.  Here's why that was so.  Having come in towards the later part of the evening, the waitress told us that they were in short supply of lobster.  Thankfully, because we were in Maine, someone from the restaurant basically just walked down towards the wharf and grabbed some fresh lobster that were just picked-up.  The phrase farm-to-table is thrown around much these days but this was a prime example of farm-to-table, or in this case ocean-to-table.

My friends and I started the meal with fish and chips as our shared appetizers.  Knowing what was going to be ahead of us we didn't want to unnecessarily fill up our gluttonous stomachs.  After devouring the appetizer the main event arrived at the table.  Four friends each were suddenly face-to-face with the twin lobster dinner.  At $24.95 this is one of the best deals for lobster I have ever seen.  Two steaming red lobsters, three potatoes, corn on the cob, and a butter roll were piled on to an unassuming dinner plate with a perfectly placed sauce cup in the middle of all the cacophony.  Every bite of the lobster, every dip into the butter, every succulent juice made for an experience that can only be defined as life-changing.  The flavor of the ocean was present and the slight sweetness of the lobster was luxury defined.  I've had lobster buffet dinners as well as lobster tails at Michelin restaurants before but there was something about this experience that stuck.  It will be hard to get over this one I tell you.  I haven't had a craving for lobster since my trip to Portland.  I guess my mind simply won't allow me to have any other one until I make a return visit.  For those who want an amazing lobster dinner, this place deserves all the praise I have given it.  It truly is as good as it gets."
1651,"We were recommended to go there by a local, the local was not wrong. We are trying to plan another trip to Portland to just go to this place again. Since we went off season the place was very quiet, we loved it. The food was amazing, I'm still thinking about those crab cakes. It was so cheap, we had 4 lobsters, shrimp cocktails, climb chowder and lobster roll (and a shipyard on the side). You gotta have your beeraaaaa. Less than $100 dollars for a lot of food. The service was great and very fast. The best part, the sailor was playing chess, as we eat our meal. We thought the man was joking but then we realized the man had salt on his sleeve. Just a very nice experience over all. We loved the whole experience. We loved the space and took some pictures. Also, the outside was super nice, right on the water. You cannot ask for a better view, the place was full of snow. We got some great pictures with the boat and snow. Very nice place, hope to come back soon."
1652,Twin lobster dinner $24.95. are trolley drivers sit this is where the locals eat. You sure that there is a $5 additional charge to split. If you check your bill you find a 20% service charge already included
1653,"This is based on cocktails on the deck only.  We went after seeing Pat Benatar at the Maine State Pier & had a lovely time.  It was not too crowded at 9:00, service was quick, beer was good.  I did venture inside to use the ladies room & it must have been 1,000 degrees inside.  I would likely never eat inside especially since you can sit outside & soak in the ocean air.  I'll be back for dinner some day soon I hope."
1654,"We were super stoked to find Rosie's after traipsing around all of Portland for the afternoon. Had a hankering for clams, and they really scratched that itch!

We both had the Clam Roll special, and at just $10, was well worth it! Great bread, perfectly fried clam strips, nice heat to the sriracha mayo and just an all around winner in my book. The $4 ice Pick Vodka drinks didn't hurt either. 

When I get back to Portland, I'll definitely be back to try the wings and burgers, they looked and smelled fantastic!"
1655,"The wings are amazing! We ordered mild buffalo and thai chili. Both were fried to perfection and tasted great. 

We also had the salmon burger and lobster roll. The salmon burger was okay, I wouldn't order it again. The lobster roll was pretty good! Only $13. It wasn't the best one I've had but it was a steal. 

Highly recommend for a quick bite!"
1656,"I've had many mixed experiences at Rosie's. One thing that remains constant-- their wings. 

When you walk into Rosie's, you have to know what to do because no one will greet you or tell you. You have two options: 1. sit at the bar or 2. turn the corner and sit at a table. You can somewhat rearrange the furniture without anyone bothering you. This also slightly reflects the service at Rosie's. 

We came to eat dinner because we knew we wanted some good wings. I know most people who come here come for the beer deals they have. 

When we sat ourselves at our table, and we were asked if we wanted menus. We said yes. Five minutes passes and the other waitress comes around and asks if we want menus. We say yes again. We finally get menus. 

We place our order: brussel sprouts, 12 wings, and a cheesesteak. 

Once we got the brussel sprouts, we remembered that they taste frozen and defrosted and cooked. They do lack some flavor. We got 6 wings as buffalo and 6 as thai chili. They were both delicious. I would recommend the thai chili option as it's a bit on the sweeter side. The cheesesteak was delicious. We got it without the bun (diet restrictions) and it was like real steak and not shaved. We had a side of veggies which were also delicious and a $2 up charge that the waitress never told us about. 

When we get the bill, I see $0.79 charge for bleu cheese dressing which is supposed to come with the wings. Our wings came out with ranch even though we ordered bleu cheese. I asked the waitress and she corrected it, but be sure to check your bills. 

The service is subpar. We waited for some time for water refills and if you've ever eaten wings, you know that can be a struggle. The food was pretty good, as it normally is. On Sundays they have a special type of wings, and those are the best. 

A local feel without the prompt service that you can get at most Portland establishments."
1657,"Rosie's is one of those places that is a dive bar, but I appreciate what dive bars have to offer. However, I find that Rosie's doesn't measure up to some of the other dive bars around Portland.

I have been to Rosie's on numerous occasions, and they have a good atmosphere. Their venue is spacious, they have two dart boards, and they are open on holidays when many other places are not. 

One of the things that Rosie's thrives on is the fact that they have cheap beer, and they do. They don't, however, have an extensive beer list. I find that their options are limited, and it's always hard for me find a beer that I actually enjoy on their menu, however, they do make good mixed drinks. 

In all the times that I have come to Rosie's, I had never tried their food, but I was able to try it the other night with a group of friends. One thing about Rosie's is that there is never a wait, and they offer a variety of pub food like nachos, sandwiches, pizzas, etc. I ended up ordering the buffalo chicken nachos. Was I blown away? No. The chicken was spicy, which I actually enjoyed, but the nachos consisted of chips, chicken, a minuscule amount of peppers and onions, and cheese that barely melted. The fries were also just okay.

Do I hate Rosie's? No. Will I come back for drinks and a ""chill"" atmosphere? Yes. Will I specifically come back for their food? No, however, it also isn't HORRIBLE, so I would come back with a group of friends if we were looking for some quick eats."
1658,"Lena and I came in here after she heard high recommendations from a local. The lobster roll was on special with fries for the cool cool price of $12.99 and it was delicious. Paired with a cup of the clam chowder and a few specials of mules, you found the spot! Service was very quick and the music was good. Definitely pick this over some of the other very busy tourist joints."
1659,"The food was great, and the servers were really nice. It was a little slow, but we didn't mind. I ordered the wings (they were so good), and the salmon spinach salad (word good as well). They also had a pretty nice selection of beers, too."
1660,"I ALWAYS have a good time when I hit up Rosie's.

Though this part of town is usually a touristy, busy nightmare, I tend to enjoy Rosie's and can overlook how irritating the Old Port crowds can be. That's how worth it this bar is.

It's divey, a little grungy, and full of locals - JUST HOW I LIKE IT.
When literally everywhere in the city was closed on Christmas Day, my boyfriend and I wandered in here and sat at the bar for literally hours, sipping extraordinarily cheap beer ($1 Millers!) and conversing with the hilarious waitstaff.
I came here yesterday, July 4, because nowhere else was open and I knew I could count on Rosie's. Little did I know they do TWO DOLLAR TUESDAYS! I ordered a mixed drink and it was literally $2. This makes my love for Rosie's grow on another level.

Free popcorn, plenty of people watching, a menu of pub fare, relatively well-maintained bathrooms, and entertaining conversations with strangers make this a place I want to be, summer or winter. Less one star because seating is almost impossible, and sometimes they're understaffed, but this is to be expected when your bar rules."
1661,"- Fun music.
- Fun staff.
- Great area for a food/drink joint.
- The food is delicious.
- 1 time they messed up my order THEY GAVE ME FREE FOOD & DRINKS TO MAKE UP FOR IT as well as fixing my order! (score!)
- Cheapest drinks in town.
- They fill the beer glasses all the way to the top.
- Their fall beers are the best-tasting.
- Huge bar and plenty of seats.
- Bathrooms are always clean and well-stocked, with big mirrors so you can see your full outfit before you go back out."
1662,"Years and years I've been coming here. I never had a problem with Rosie's or and of their bad attitude devil may care bartenders until recently. (Aside from the fact that they have ignorant, white trash doormen). I guess I should have remained more classy, instead of buying months old rotater beer for a buck a piece, and went to cleaner places. Kara, Paige, Abby, and Terrance will all pretty much be nice to your face but talk trash and smack behind your back. If you want to be ignored for most of your visit or be overcharged and short changed you should definitely come here, but otherwise Tomasso Canteen is right around the corner where the deals are just as good and the bartenders actually know how to do their job."
1663,"Great! Simple but delicious bar food offerings at a great price. After a week travelling down the coast from bar harbor, we agreed it was best lobster roll we had had and about half the price.

With an excellent selection of beers on draft including local brews such as Allagash, it was exactly what we wanted. They also have a daily brew that they feature and is inexpensive so you are incentized to try something new.

Service was great and people were all very friendly."
1664,Insanely awesome deals on beers and drinks. That's usually what brings me into Rosie's. I've tried the burger/fries and the wings which were all OK. Its definitely a dive and the staff can be a little gnarly too but still fun!!
1665,"I went to Rosie's for lunch this afternoon and ordered the tsunami sliders, which included pulled pork, bacon, and pineapple. I chose to get the sliders without jalapeños, because that would've exceeded my personal spice tolerance level. The plate came with 3 sliders and fries, which was a pretty large portion. The food was not exceptional, but tasty nonetheless and very filling.

Service was good, and our waitress was friendly. I liked the atmosphere of the place, and even though it calls itself a pub, I, as a non-drinker of alcohol, did not feel out of place. There were actually a couple younger children enjoying their meals at the table next to mine. I would recommend Rosie's to a wide range of people, from families looking for a lunch or dinner place in Portland to a couple friends looking for a drinking spot."
1666,"Rosie's remains a decent dive bar yet its missing the atmosphere that existed ""back in the day"" when the venue was owned by Steve and Rosie.  Sure, times change and now Rosie's has new owners and the popcorn is still free.  Many of the 20-somethings who patronage Rosie's weren't around when this place was one of the best bars in the Old Port.  My only advice to the new owners is to think about asking the people who've supporting Rosie's over the years what's missing and see if they can figure out a way to meet everyone's needs in terms of what they offer and the overall aesthetic experience.  As far as Rosie's food is concerned I'd say it's fairly decent and reasonably priced.  They could have a more extensive beer selection."
1667,"What a fun fun place!!! We went here after we were disappointed with our first choice and we are so happy we did! This place is amazing. The staff was fun, the location itself is so unique, and the food is amazing!

Everything in this place was brick or old wood. The bar was packed, the darts were all taken, and music was filling the air as people were laughing and staying dry out of the rain. 

The food was amazing and that's the main focus. Who would've thought a burger could taste so good. But be aware, they're big!! Also, they have these amazing fries that are legit to die for. I don't know what they are or how they make them but every bar should have these fries!

If you want amazing food with an amazing atmosphere, this is your place!!"
1668,This is a dive bar with local flair and great burgers and beer.  The service is friendly and the locals entertaining - I felt like I was right at home and back in South Philly.
1669,Biggest bang for your buck! My boyfriend was pleasantly surprised to see $1.50 high life. I got the lobster roll and it was delicious! I spent twice as much for a lobster roll in Maine a few days before and I can honestly say the one from Rosie's was better! Cool atmosphere with great hospitality.
1670,Cold beer and tasty appetizers in a casual environment. What more could I ask for? Been going to this establishment since way way back. Ownership may have changed but still the same Rosie's.
1671,"Fun place, good music and great bartenders! Had fun with Erin say hello for us! Would definitely come back here!"
1672,"We went in for an early dinner, 5 pm. I had the patty melt, it was phenomenal. My husband had the steak special and said the gravy was really good. Autumn was our server, she was friendly and attentive."
1673,"I have been coming here for years and it is still one of my favorite bars. The menu has a variety of pub food, Mexican, Italian and comfort food dishes. The beer selection is mediocre. They offer a daily .99 rotating tap and I think I even saw a .75 tap on special a few weeks ago. They also have one of my favorite bartenders, Kara, who is the best! I'd reccommend going late afternoon/early evening if you are trying to avoid crowds. They also have a dart board if you are into that. Overall, a decent spot."
1674,"The fried chicken dinner is outrageously good, probably the best I've had. Don't even get me started with the side winder fries. The whole meal was delicious.

I gave it 4 stars because they asked for id when we walked in and we told them we were just eating dinner. And one of the friends I was with didn't have her id. He wouldn't let her in to eat dinner. All three of us had just gotten off a long waitressing shift and just wanted some food. I think it's pretty crazy that you have to be 21 just to eat here.

Other than that the food was excellent! The service was a bit slow but we could clearly see how busy she was so it didn't bother us too much.

Will most definitely be back!"
1675,Great place - I recommend the pizza- fantastic crowd... Erin the Bartender was hilarious and very attentive!
1676,"Okay, so when you're hinking of trying a delicious authentic Maine lobster roll, Rosies doesn't look like it would fulfill. I promise you that's not the case! We saw a sign outside that said lobster roll for $12.99 and we decided to gice it a try. Inside is a typical bar/pub setting so we were hesitant but when the food came out our eyes glowed green. It came with a side of fries amd coleslaw which was unexpected but welcome. The lobsteroll was unexpectedly good! Not too saucy and stuffed with a bunch of lobster for a steal. Definately worth trying in my humble opinion."
1677,"Recommend you keep walking, if Portland is the foodie capital of New England, it's not because of this place.  4 of us ate there:  lobster roll was fair, the salmon burger was not good (like a frozen patty), burger was good, wings were ok.  Service was poor.  Atmosphere was poor."
1678,"When there for lunch today...not busy at all.. 2 servers/bartenders , both made I contact with me.. never came to my table, I had to get my own menu.. finally left...and will never come back."
1679,"We had just finished a lobster boat tour, and it seemed like it was a million degrees outside and muggy, so we needed a place that was nice and cool with some great food, and we were not disappointed! It was past the traditional lunch hour (close to 2pm) so obviously it wasn't hard to get a seat. Rosie's has lots of tv's so we were easily entertained while cooling off and waiting for our delicious lunch. Food was piping hot and so yummy - even a simple grilled cheese and bacon was to die for! This stop was wonderful, and we would go again in a heartbeat!"
1680,My group of seven went there last night and honestly we are well traveled and my sister owns a very successful bar. The bartenders seemed bothered when we asked them for anything. The jukebox would not take our bills and instead of offering any assistance or an exchange of bills they just sat there. Also more than once they took our drinks off the bar and dumped them when we went to visit with others or to use the rest rooms with no offer to replace them.
1681,"Nice, no frills, neighborhood bar kind of place. I ordered an Allagash White, but they didn't have a slice of orange for it. My dinner was a really good scallop BLT, which was in a roll up that had been cooked until it was just perfectly crispy on the outside...a nice surprise. Service was good, although we had to go and find our server when we wanted to pay and leave. Might have stayed longer, but the noise level was so high our group of four couldn't hear ourselves talk. The place was packed, and on a Thursday night too. I'll definitely come back, since I do live in the neighborhood, but I'll come at a less crowded time of day."
1682,"There isn't a thing you can complain about..

They have an awesome location with a bumpin' atmosphere. They play the best music (lots and lots of rap/hip hop). They have plenty of TV's, that always have a sporting event on them. They have great customer service, with friendly and attentive staff. PLUS, the blue mango veggie burgers are incredible. You really can't ask for much more.. Well, you can.. You can ask for craft beer or the typical macro brews and they'll serve em up.  Especially if you're in the mood for $.99 miller lites!

Big fan, I'll always come back."
1683,"Meager beer selection but pretty good food, and overall a great dive in Portland!
My friends and I had been waiting to eat at some of the fancier shmancier places in town before we gave up on the hour waits to stop in at Rosie's. Upon entering, we had no idea this was ranked as one of the best dive bars in the country, but it was definitely one of the best I've been to. 

From calzones to burgers, salads and even stir fry, the food at Rosie's is varied and altogether quite good. I ordered a southwestern chicken wrap with spiced chicken, black beans, rice, corn, peppers & cheese. Our server was relaxed, down to earth and extremely quick considering how packed the bar was. Overall, good experience but not worth a long drive!"
1684,local dive bar - friendly service local patrons decent place to watch a game if your a beer drinker small wine selection fried foods stayed for a drink
1685,"***** excellent lobster roll & $2 well drinks, how can you go wrong! winner, winner lobster roll dinner!"
1686,"Best patty melt ever--open on Christmas and a real nice surprise.
Cannot wait to go back"
1687,"This place is a gem! Always a great time here. It is divvy in the best way possible. Great drinks, great prices and great food. Good burgers, tuna melt and waffle fries :)"
1688,"I remember ages ago, like 2014, when rosies was a hole in the wall. Well that hole got a lot bigger! Rosies is a bumping hotspot now with dollar beers and darts. And it has popcorn, like 3$ deweys but without the terrible. I wish these spots (rosies, samuels, tomasos, evelyns) would stay shrouded in secrecy to college kids, but this bar is everything you need in a bar"
1689,"This place is great! After touring Portland with my boyfriend and pretty much only going to breweries or places that only served IPA's, I was happy to find Rosie's. This bar serves your typical everyday beers but with an extra friendly staff and a great playlist. I came here a few times when I was craving a simple MIchelob Ultra away from all the fancy beers that my boyfriend was drinking. I never had any food, so I can't comment on that, but overall it was a safe and basic bar with good drinks and good music."
1690,"We can always trust we'll have a great burger here.  The menu had changed a little bit and a couple of our favorite burgers were no longer listed, but still faired well.  Had also gone out of our 'regular' zone to try fish n'chips and wonderfully surprised at how great this was.  Fish chowder also gets an enthusiastic thumbs up! 
We appreciate the consistency year after year."
1691,"Native (local) - 

Ok, I'm not a local anymore but I'm still a native. 

I've always loved Rosie's because it's a chill spot but had never eaten there. I didn't think I'd find anything suitable since I'm vegan but to my surprise they had a blue mango veggie burger. 

Blue mango veggie burger - *** 5/5 *** It was my first time trying it and it was hands down the BEST veggie burger I've ever had. It's very spinachy but not crumbly or dry and sweet but not too sugary. I shared it with my friend and she's obsessed with it and she's not even a vegetarian, so that's proof. 

Environment *** 5/5 *** 
Dope crew, dope set up, cheap beers and good service. Plus, our server was pretty cute so I can't complain."
1692,"Great local spot. Nothing fancy, just good food, good drinks, and friendly service. Right next door is a little winery / distillery that has a good deal on tastings, so we stopped there before getting a great lunch at Rosie's.  I even got a taste of my local hometown bar in the midwest since they've got self-serve popcorn."
1693,"The other night I found myself right across the street from Rosie's with some friends, on a random Wednesday night, and we were all starving.  My friend suggested Rosie's and I thought, why not?
Upon entering, we all noticed that the place was pretty packed.  It was definitely a Friday night crowd on a Wednesday night.  We found a small table on the side, turned it into a table for three and sat down.
During the early part of our time at Rosie's the noise level in the room we were in was insanely loud.  There was a big, super happy group of twenty-somethings next to us, and quite honestly, if any of us had started yodeling at the top of our lungs, it would have been completely absorbed by the noise around us.
There were 2 choices of beer that night for 99 cents a glass.  One was Miller High Life (which I picked) and I don't remember the other.  We all ordered freshly made calzones which were on special that night.  It was a ""create your own calzone"" deal where you could pick up to 4 fillings for 7.99.  I fashioned one with hamburg, spinach, mushrooms and onion, it was very good and HUGE!
With tip, my entire meal came to $12, which is pretty astounding for the Old Port."
1694,"I'm a regular here. Godd place to meet up with local Portlanders, as well as, visit with out-of-townrrs Good food on a budget and grest drink prices too."
1695,"I love this place. It's a dive bar (which I always keep close to my heart). It has an old, turn of the century taverna atmosphere. Free popcorn, darts, a full-bar, and dining area. The food is typical pub-food, but very good. They always have decent specials. 

I don't know what it is, but I always have fun here..."
1696,"$13.99 for a lobster roll! And it was really good, it wasn't stuffed with mayo and other fillers. Staff was friendly and efficient. One of the few places that was still serving food past 10pm."
1697,We had a delicious meal. The service was also excellent! Had great birthday celebration here.
1698,"My boyfriend and I went here while visiting Portland.  We were shaking with hunger and wanted pub food.  We picked Rosie's and were happy with our choice!  I had a burger melt with fries and he had a burger (I think bacon burger?) and fries.  I think his only complaint was his burger fell apart and it was difficult to eat.

Servers were nice, music was good.  All in all, a good spot to check out!"
1699,"A nice surprise! We walked in on a whim, sat at the bar and enjoyed a great meal & cocktails at great prices. Ordered the chicken & veggie nachos and the Greek stuffed burger. Both were amazing. I'm a picky nacho consumer and these were topped generously with the veggies and black beans and grilled chicken (not breaded and fried). They were lightly baked, giving a nice, melted and crunchy experience. My husband's Greek burger was terrific, featuring beef but stuffed with spinach, the Greek cheese and topped with tzatziki sauce. The menu was diverse and featured more than your average bar food."
1700,Walked in and the place smelled so badly of weed we turned around and walked right out. Nobody wants to eat food surrounded by the smell of skunk.
1701,"If you are looking for something that is almost in the ""dive"" category yet is still right down the road from other more upscale bars.  It gives a good alternative to the high priced establishments downtown.

We just had beers and some bar popcorn but the deal was a good pint of brew for a hefty price of $1.50 each so I don't know if you could beat that action.  Outside of the dart board area being loud and obnoxious  it was a pretty cool place to go and chill with some friends for a less expensive price.

Our waitress was attentive and super friendly which made the experience better.

If I had eaten food this night I might have been able to give 4 stars but 3 will suffice for now knowing what you are getting into with the dive bar feel that it gives."
1702,"My new favorite dish at Rosie's is their Southern Fried Chicken - it is incredibly good. 

Rosie's has been a long time favorite, but there have been some recent changes - they no longer have steak fries (instead they serve a breaded, thick cut curly fry), they no longer have a hot dog on the menu, and they chicken finger basket is no longer an option (though, regulars can still request it). 

Tonight I had the fried chicken, as did one of our friends, my wife had a half order of the veggie nachos with chicken, and our other friend had a burger. Rosie's does a great job with burgers. Drinks are great and affordable, and the staff is always friendly. 

I just wish they'd change the fries back."
1703,"$1.50 for Miller Lite? Where am I? Not that Miller Lite is ever my choice, however it'll do, especially at that price for a draft.  We didn't stay long.  Staff was nice and attentive.  Place seemed chill and small, but had a good vibe for a quick drink or a night full of Miller Lite."
1704,"Well let me start of by saying we ate here on a late lunch, it was quiet and service was good, however there was a man very drunk or something was going on with him. I was shocked they still served him beer. He was constantly yawning very loudly (doesn't sound that bad, but it was), making noises, rambling, etc. The food itself was good. I really enjoyed the chowder I had and the salad. But then I saw this sign, which I took a picture of... I know this is a joke, but as a woman and mother of a young daughter I am just not finding it that funny. The sign reads ""men: no shirt, no shoes, no service, women: no shirt, no shoes, free beer."" Harmless, I'm sure many of you reading that sign think, and that's your opinion, but I'm not a fan."
1705,"The food was great, and service was good when it could be but it's more of a pub and grub than a place for a date. Although the service was slow, they were very busy and the food was tasty. Would definitely recommend for a bite and drink but wouldn't recommend for an intimate meal unfortunately due to the atmosphere 
Update: took us 15 mins to get a working pen to sign our tab. Atmosphere is loud and the service was slow."
1706,Bad taste in my mouth because of the grumpy someone wannabe bouncer who gave me a hard time regardless of a NY state issued ID. For prejudiced issues that are not even worth mentioning here. Also got extremely nauseous after the quesedilla and cocktail shrimp. Definitely will not be back
1707,"Rosie's is a fun little dive bar. 

Beer selection isn't anything special- I suggest visiting during Tuesday happy hour for long trail ale for 1.95. If that's not a deal, nothing is. 

Friendly staff, yummy apps (try the poutine- best I've had in Portland so far), clean bathrooms, all the right games on. 

No frills here, nothing special, but you know what you'll get. Meet some locals, get a cheap beer, try an app. You'll be happy."
1708,"Happy Hour was fun! Love the jute-box music playing, locals drinking and laughing. Bartenders were smiling and atmosphere was chill!"
1709,"My experience with Rosie's can be summed up in one sentence: one time, a pipe burst above the bar, and people continued ordering $1 beers, myself included.

I love, love, love this bar. I love the $1 Millers. I love the surprisingly good bar food (shout out to whoever makes their fries!) I love the sometimes lovely, sometimes surly bartenders and wait staff. I love that Fleetwood Mac is often followed up by Drake on the juke box. I love their beaten up dart boards.

Hell, I even love their EXTREMELY hit or miss 75¢ drafts.

Yes, there are better bars in Portland. Yes, they have no outside seating. But I will always, always come back to Rosie's."
1710,"They remind me of Ted Cruz's recent bid for President- except they tried. Unlike Ted Cruz's presidential bid though, they succeed in bringing a comfortable atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. Ted Cruz, by contrast worries me and makes me wonder if anyone can enjoy a good beer, a good 1.50 dollar rotating tap and the darts that Rosie's provides. Get dunked Cruz."
1711,"The last time I went into Rosie's it was smokey.
How smokey was it?!
It was soooo smokey that my eyes were irritated and I left there reeking of burger.
Not a great punchline, but it's the truth.

Besides that, I've had good experiences at Rosie's. It's a dimly-lit place, a few short steps above a dive bar, with darts, pub food, and beers. But what they do they do well. 

The varieties of burgers they offer are all delicious, and the fries are the sort of addictive pub fries you'd hope for in a place like this. I haven't explored the rest of their menu, so I can't comment.

Rosie's is one of those places that I'm glad exists. It's comfortable like an old baseball hat, and a little dirty like one too."
1712,"New owners have ruined a great thing.  The food is super Meh, the clientele is 20 something drunks and most of the servers give no f*cks."
1713,"I confidently give Rosie's 5 stars. I believe this is the best pub in the Old Port to grab a quiet, unassuming, reasonably-priced pint with friends - and some solid comforting pub fare while you're at it. My friends and I have been coming here for over a decade now, and I'm happy to say that little has changed.  If anything, they've gotten a little bit busier over the years.  It certainly flirts with the dive bar moniker, but I find this place far too charming (and clean) to officially wear the title.  

What I especially like:

- Friendly, attentive staff.

- The locals. Sometimes scary, always salt of the earth types lingering at the bar. Don't make eye contact else you'll be in for a long drunken conversation about sports, gambling, sports gambling, and/or alimony payments. However long you've been hanging out there, I promise you that they've been there for at least four hours longer.

- The all-day happy hour specials, which are the best in the Old Port.  $0.99 for High Life - and sometimes also $0.99 for a pint from some keg they're trying desperately to kick. That's really why I come in - to play beer roulette; In recent visits I've had a great Pumpkin ale (3 months out of season) and a terrible UFO grapefruit beer. It's hit or miss, but you always win when you're paying $0.99/pint! Seriously is this 1974? They've found my price point!

- Food specials. Between a full meal and 2 pints, if you play it right it's reasonable to walk out with only a $12 tab (including tip). 

Other reasons to visit:

-Darts
-Popcorn
-Entertaining literature in the bathrooms 

It can get a little loud, but what do expect from a clientele that's buying $0.99 drafts? At that price, they're lucky the place isn't burnt down, that there aren't random escaped zoo animals scurrying about, or even that the bar hasn't been taken over by people who look like they could have been Waterworld extras. Although that sounds like a me the type of place where I'd go for happy hour!"
1714,"Did not accept Canadian ID, I ruined my night for my friends because I'm the only one who couldn't get in. Baboons running the door."
1715,"45 minute wait for simple orders,during which the waitress simply avoided our table,not even offering refills of iced tea or anything.....  The hot chicken was just Tabasco on a plain chicken breast.  The nachos were soggy.  The ""mango"" fish tacos had no sauce.  Fries were barely cooked.  Save your time and money.  Five Guys would have been a better choice."
1716,"Rosie's was a pleasant surprise. Honestly, the place doesn't look like much; I'm sure it's a great dive bar. Don't be fooled. The food and the service here are both great, and the prices for downtown Portland are better than fair. My daughter had the veggie burger, and I had the lobster roll. Both were terrific. I'm glad we stopped in."
1717,"My wife and I were there on August 8th for dinner and as in the past , it was a wonderful experience!! Drank 99cent Labatt drafts while waiting for my old college friend to show up. 

One of the specials was 2 tenderloin medallions with mashed potatoes for $9.99!!!! The beef cut like butter and melted in the mouth!!

We've always made it a point to stop at Rosie's when we're in Maine and have never been disappointed - it's slightly off the beaten path but well worth the extra steps!!!"
1718,"Had planned on Duckfat, but they were full and lengthy wait so we hit the streets and decided to stop in at Rosie's.
Typical hole in the wall bar, darts, popcorn, tvs with sports. Good pub food. Really limited beer menu, some good specials if you are a college kid looking to get lit. 
We both had the Reuben (part of our Reuben quest..to find the best Reuben in Portland) must say it was very good, very tasty black pastrami, nice sauce, really tasty weird looking fries. So far number #2 Reuben on the quest."
1719,Absolutely love this place!! Fantastic music selection and the friendliest staff around! Five stars
1720,"Old bar, great staff, cheap beer prices and good food for a pub!  Add it to your pub crawl list, hard to go wrong here!!!"
1721,"Fun place, I have yet to try the food but there's always good drinks and drinks specials. Fun environment. Darts, popcorn and good vibes!"
1722,My family and I  just went to Rosies in the old port portland maine where we have gone for years and we were quite disappointed. Under new ownership it has gone down hill. For an old port dive bar the prices were quite high. I ordered 2 capt. And cokes totaling $18. And believe me there was hardly any alcohol in these drinks. And As a morgan drinker I know I just paid for that entire bottle of liquor. And the service was barely mediocre. With two bartenders hardly as attentive to customers as they were with each other. Unfortunately Rosies just lost 4  unhappy and unsatisfied customers.
1723,Great service price and quality. It is a low key bar that is unpretentious if you need a break from that.
1724,"This is a relaxed spot to grab a drink and some decent food.  It has a rustic feel, but the atmosphere is charming and the service is good enough.  A server was even willing to point out that I had a piece of lettuce on my cheek, and wipe it away, which shows just how friendly and comfortable employees are with guests, lol."
1725,Husband and I were strolling around in Portland and saw a woman through the window who was enjoying her food.  She gestured to us that the food was very good.  You just can't pass that up. We both had lobster rolls and they were very good.  We really should have branched out and one of us had something else.  They had BANANA CREME PIE that I was too full to eat.  I was grumpy for the rest of the trip.
1726,"Went here one night with a family member that was new to the Portland area. Rosie's was overcrowded with people not knowing where to sit and just standing around because there wasn't enough room. Our waitress took 15 minutes to get our drink orders and the table we were sitting at was a mess. When our food arrived (a half hour later) the pizza was overcooked and the meat on our hamburger was way undercooked. When we asked if we could exchange it for something else we got a snarky look and the waitress said ""We don't do exchanges"". I just wasn't pleased with the customer service and cleanliness of this bar. Definitely better places to go in downton Portland."
1727,I have to say this place is it for a nice burger and cheap beers. The waitstaff is nice and fast and the food is Ooh so Good. So far the best burger I had under 10 bucks.
1728,In love! Best bar in town! Rosie's is always fun and best price for a decent lobster roll in Portland!
1729,"This place was so filthy when we walked in we literally turned around and walked out, Dirty windows and floors littered with old popcorn, wadded up napkins and other trash. It was disgusting."
1730,Nice atmosphere in Old Port. Nice price. Top 100 US bars in Esquire Magazine. 15 taps and 7 microbrews.
1731,Service was terrible and we found a hair in our food. Definitely a crappy dive bar. Disappointed we wasted a meal here.
1732,"Good food, very good service and cheap beers.  A good place to catch a game on TV. 
Gets crowded but seems to turn over pretty quick. 
Tuesday's $2  Bacardi specials."
1733,Have to love a gin and tonic served in a pint glass. The most interesting french fry in Maine. Wings are pretty OK too. Nice people. Annoying jukebox.
1734,"Good prices, large portions, and a nice selection of things on tap.  It was also open later than the surrounding places in Portland, which was nice when we got in late after flying all day.  I had the clam chowder, which was a little on the watery side, but still good and my fiance had the fried clam strips, which were high quality."
1735,"Good choice of fresh tasting food. Really good cheeseburger. Pizza had a good flavor, but the crust was on the soggy side even after asking for it to be crispy."
1736,"Grabbed a bite to eat here while in town for the Weezer concert. Food was ok. Service took over two hours for two. Would not recommend for lunch for a quick bite, unless you are only ordering drinks."
1737,"This is going to be a quick review, but Nick is the best bartender in town -- hands down. Food is great and consistent... Along with the best popcorn."
1738,"Looks like your typical dive bar, but the burgers and apps were awesome. I had Rosie's Nasty Habit and that was an incredible burger. We only discovered the place by asking a local on the street for a good place to eat.  This is where they said right off the top of their head and it did not disappoint!"
1739,Waited forever but the servers never came so I had to go look for a menu and go order the menu. Everything was very slow and not prompt. It took us more than 30 minutes to get a glass of water and the place wasn't even busy. Got fried clam cake and didn't taste the clam till the middle portion of the cake. Wasn't a fan of it much. Nice staff though.
1740,"The fries were good, but I had the salmon and it was gross. My wife had the southwest chicken wrap and it was pretty weird tasting too. They brought my wife a burger at first so we had to send it back, and getting our food took a long time anyway. Also the whole place was crazy loud. I'd definitely avoid this place unless you are just going for drinks and don't mind a ton of noise."
1741,"We're waiting forever for our meal, they got it wrong and had to bring it back out. Our server should have had another one sharing load, he was basically running around all night. Food was mediocre and over priced. Loud and squished also."
1742,Great atmosphere.  Really good burgers. And unbelievable curly fries. Definitely will return.
1743,"Had the most amazing server Debby!! She was awesome we were 8 girls that had tried 2 other places before coming here, that had awful service aka we were grumpy! Went to Rosie's and Debby took care of us gave us great places to visit while staying here for the weekend! Loved her definitely ask for her when you visit great food service and drinks!!!"
1744,"Wonderful surprise. We had no expectations - Fourth of July and every place was packed. What a great typical bar /pub experience!  5* club sandwich with real sliced roast turkey. Excellent draft beer and very good service - thanks Alicia! And on top of that, definitely less expensive than the waterfront eateries."
1745,"Awesome. Popcorn, darts, good people, good cold beer, and they know your name. What more could you want?  This is my favorite bar in Portland. 

Their food is pretty good, too. Portions tend towards enormous. 

The holiday book drive/sale, when the bar gets half taken over by shelves of books to benefit charity, is fairly hilarious."
1746,"This is a 3.5. This was a mixed bag for my family, and although the young ones gave it a 5, I'm sticking lower. 

It seems the big in our party was the club cheeseburger- a sandwich burger combo full of meat! I got the Greek burger, which had a nice twist with feta, spinach, and tomato. Sweet potato fries were also good. The chicken teriyaki was said to be a bust...

Place wasn't overly bar-like and had friendly service. There was also free popcorn, which I'm a big fan of. Wasn't anything super impressive but a great pit stop with a special touch. No complaints!"
1747,"The best clam chowder I've ever had, and the grilled cheese with tomato and spinach was outstanding, too. The bread was perfectly toasty, the vegetables fresh, and the cheese was authentic Cabot cheddar. Don't be dissuaded by the look of the older bar when you first walk in--the service is outstanding and the food all homemade and delicious!"
1748,"Great dive! Not too loud or packed, so You can actually have a conversation or play darts and not have to yell. Usually a pretty mellow crowd, not likely to have any fights or drama. Great food too.

Slow service, just go straight to the bar."
1749,Good cold beer. Great burgers. Cajun black and blue was great and had a nice kick!  Good local bar. Just visiting and glad we stumbled in here... and stumbled out!
1750,"Love this place! I personally love pubs so this is definitely up my alley. It's nothing fancy, just a good 'ole pub. Dependable, great food, good service, relaxed, good beer/drink options. It's just a great place to go when you're in Portland. Definitely worth checking out."
1751,Real friendly place. I'll come back the next time I'm in town.
1752,"Jesus, I love this place.  I recently spent two very happy hours at the bar here with a couple of drafts of their excellent Hooker Pale and their fucking amazing steak fries with brown gravy.  The staff are v friendly and the conversation around me was funny, warm and wise.  

It's not a fancy place, but not quite a dive either - it's salt o'the earth plain honest-to-God local bar.  

The Brian version of heaven looks a lot like this..."
1753,Just ok...husband got the meatloaf sandwich special and wasn't impressed. This from a man who's never met a meatloaf he didn't like. My buffalo fingers were pretty good and I loved their Hooker Ale. Service was fast but not overly friendly.
1754,I really enjoyed the food at Susan's fish and chips. I has a seafood combo of oysters and scallops and my kids had hot dogs and chicken nuggets. A local favorite with great fried seafood!
1755,"We loved the fish and chips, chowder, and onion rings. The breading is light and flaky. Staff is very friendly."
1756,"Susan's Fish-n-Chips is a good place to get your seafood fix for reasonable prices! Located in kind of a hole-the-wall building, with an auto repair shop next door, but it's actually much bigger inside than it looks. There are 8 large picnic tables inside and bathrooms too (you never know in these kinds of places).   They will even cook your self caught seafood for you if you bring it in. 

The guys taking orders were nice and helpful with recommending what to get. I chose crab cakes. I originally intended on having a lobster roll but since I ate one for lunch I decided I didn't really want a second one today. My husband got it though and said it was really good.  The crab cakes weren't the best I've had, they were overly fried with lots of breading. But the portion size (2) was good and it came with two sides of your choice. 

My mom got the smelt, and dad had scallops (all fried). I tried one of each and the scallops were good.  The thought of smelt was disgusting to me but mom loved it. They gave her a huge portion too.  

All in all it was a pretty good place. I'm not a huge fan of fried seafood, but if you are, this place will be perfect for you."
1757,"This is what we call ""a hole in the wall"" kinda restaurant. & you know what, those are the best kind. The fried haddock was delicate and flaky, while the lobster roll wasn't too bad either. I believe they comp your meal if it's your birthday (must be your ACTUAL date of birth)."
1758,"My family's been going here for years and we always recommend it to tourists coming through for the quality and value. Always fresh! Tuesday is $2.50 fish burger day. Sure, it may not be in an iconic location, but again the quality and value are unbeatable. For me the fried shrimp and clam cakes are favorites. Also you have to love the neat stained glass, tacky but awesomely Maine decor, and old school wooden games for the kids to play with while you wait for your food. That hasn't changed since I went with my grandparents back in the day. Basically, if you're in the know, you'll go here - because you won't get ripped off and it's consistently really good, plus it's an authentic Portland experience. Only downside is having to get back out into traffic at Morrill's Corner after, but it's worth it. :)"
1759,"This is the place that is you are local and grew up in Maine then you will absolutely love it; if you are a visitor who doesn't like simple fresh seafood taste and likes heavy seasoned flavores food  then this is not the best place for you. 
reasonable priced."
1760,"Just got into town arriving from South Florida and this was our first stop on our lobster roll and clam eating tour.
Did alot of research into finding the ""best places for lobster rolls"".
The restaurant atmosphere was as expected - a mom and pop with local crowd.
Unfortunately we were terribly dissappointed .
The lobster roll was tasteless and clearly previously frozen.
We also had clam chowder and fish chowder. Both were equally tasteless and watery. Fried clams consisted mostly breading not at all living up to what we anticipated.

Spent lots of money and left hungry!"
1761,Amazing food! We drove up to ME just for a good seafood meal and this place definitely came through!
1762,"Came here based on a recommendation of a local. I ordered the lobster roll with potato salad, both were good. Also got to try to fried scallops which were better than the lobster imo. Interesting environment and friendly staff were a treat. Would return if in the area."
1763,"I think it should be called Susan's Chowder House, the seafood chowder is outstanding, the best I've ever had.  The lobster roll is your typical traditional roll on a hot dog bun with a bit of lettuce & mayo.  It was good but I have had better.  My SO got the combo plate with scallops & haddock and said it was fresh & tasty.  All in all it's a little kitschy, hole in the wall place that serves fresh seafood.  I definitely recommend it & will be back."
1764,Not worth the trip. Very disappointed  in the lobster roll. Yes a ton of meat but it was tasteless.  The clam chowder had more potatoes then clams . Friendly service. But won't be back.
1765,"Some of the best fried food in Maine - not because they claim to have the best seafood but because it really is that good.

Enter and order to the left, check the specials menu for daily chowders and any other daily items. Sodas available, lemonade and ice tea offer free refills. Chowders available on this visit were clam chowder, fish chowder, roasted corn and shrimp chowder and scallop and bacon chowder.

Once order has been paid for, take a seat at one of the picnic tables and the food arrives quickly.

Items available include clams, clam strips, scallops, oysters, shrimp, smelts, haddock, French fries, onion rings and calamari by the pint, quart or as part of a ""dinnah.""

Dinners include two sides (potato salad, fries, cole slaw or pasta salad) and can be ordered in a two choice combination dinner. Additional options for dinner plates are crab cakes, clam cakes, chicken tenders and trout.

Lobster rolls, crab rolls, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hot dogs and fried shrimp or clam rolls are available as sandwich options and come with fries.

Fried fish or haddock is also available in either half pound or one pound servings a la carte.

Dinners ordered this trip were a clam and scallop combo, a quart of clams and a large roasted corn and shrimp chowder.

The clams on both the quart and combo plate were lightly breaded and fried in fresh oil, served extra crisp and hot and had some of the largest most plump bellies available for a whole clam. Sweet and succulent, the breading was merely a vehicle for enjoying these briny nuggets of seafood. 

The scallops were large, juicy and similarly sweet. 

A bowl of roasted corn and shrimp chowder is rich, medium thick with a sweetness attributable to fresh shucked corn. The shrimp is highlighted by a slight kick from black and red pepper and chili powder. Sweet red peppers provide a good backstop to the small cubes of still firm, not mushy potatoes.

An excellent spot to try if in the area."
1766,"This is some of the best clog your arteries fresh fried seafood around.   Heaping portions reasonable prices, tasty.   Decor is kinda meh, things could use a dusting, which would normally knock my stars down to a 4, but FREE coffee!!! That alone will always get a star."
1767,"I came to this place after reading about this hidden gem in some article and I'm glad I came! I ordered the Lobster Roll (which was served with fries) and the bacon/scallop Chowdah. Both were so good. I'm not a huge mayo, so I'm happy this place didn't over do it. I'm in town for a few days and will be back again before I leave."
1768,"Wow, two fish burgers for $2.50 on Tuesdays.  Best value in city and the food is excellent. Don't judge this book by its cover. Can't wait to come back next time I am in Portland."
1769,"This is a solid local joint with great food. 

When you walk in, you get this thought of--are you sure it's safe to eat here? The answers is Y! E! S! YES! 

It's an order at the counter, find a table and patiently wait for your name to be called
kind of place.

There is no doubt that it can get busy and competitive to find a table. The options of seating are a bit eclectic, as are the decorations. Within a few minutes, you'll be sure to find a seat. 

When push comes to shove, you're getting some solid seafood. 

We came in as a party of 7. It seemed as though the night was dying down for them, so we didn't need to battle a crowd--which was nice. We sat at a table that had dim lighting, but it was a good fit. 

When you're at the counter ordering, you will see them legitimately taking the fresh seafood out and putting batter on it and frying it right then and there after you order it. There is no doubt that all of their food is super fresh. They make it as you order it. 

We went with the scallops, haddock sandwich, and corn chowder. The other dishes at the table were crab cakes and lobster. The scallops were perfectly fresh and delicious. The fries didn't disappoint either. Everyone at our table was happy with their orders. The servings were also a pretty nice size. 

Don't let the auto shop look fool you. Give it a try!"
1770,"I was really craving some seafood and Susan's seemed like a good place to get that fix. The whole month of February in 2018 they were having an awesome deal with a 26 cent fish and chips for any dinnah order...So the total came out to be about 23 for 2 platters and a dessert. Damn good deal if you ask me.

We ordered the fish and chips and shrimp and the chocolate peanut butter sundae. Honestly, I don't eat fried foods like this that often so I was feeling pretty sick afterwards even though it was all so good. The seafood is tender and juicy and the fried bananas in the sundae were unique. 

The atmosphere is super cute and the random free coffee is quite nice. The only negative were the fries...They were kind of mealy and hard for my tastes but overall good. For the special, it was a great value!"
1771,"OH EM GEEEEEE !!!!!! The food here is literally amazing !!!!!! The eatery itself isn't extravagant but they have a nice sailor/on the sea vibe! There's a boat and beautiful decorative items along the walls. 
There's also picnic tables -- great for groups. 

My family and I got fried pickles, mac and cheese bites (2), fish&chips, calamari and lobster roll with French fries. We also got 2 lemonades -- freee refilllls also! All for $56!!! 

The calamari was sooooo goooooood, perfectly crisp. The lobster roll was soooo gooood and had lots of flavor to it."
1772,"First experience here was not a disappointment! Perfectly cooked fish, excellent prices, and friendly service. Fries could have been a little better and a little more description on the menu board would have been nice, but will definitely be back!"
1773,"Absolutely disgusted by the food. Lobster meat was frozen and tasteless thus the lobster roll is the worst I have ever tasted. The fish chowder as runny and the frozen fish pieces were tasteless. The clam chowder was equally bad with the harden potato chunk.  The fried clam was greasy and loaded with breading.  The clam was not fresh and taste rubbery.  The customer service is non existent.  Waited for over half an hour on a week Day night for our friend.  
I will never return to this horrible place."
1774,"This was our first stop in our trip to Portland and it was a great welcome into the city. We found parking right at the front which we were surprised to find. I ordered the shrimp dinnah and husband got the combo dinnah and both were delicious! My husband also got the clam chowder breadbowl which he was a big fan of. We were also a fan of the amount that they give of all the sauces, as some places are really stingy when it comes to sauces. The staff were friendly and welcoming. I also loved the decor and feel of the restaurant, it represents Maine and the vibe you expect to feel when coming here. Overall a great experience!"
1775,Alot of lobster on the roll but just lacking flavor. Friendly server.  Decor interesting but aged.  Cleanliness questionable.
1776,"Boy oh boy, I tell ya...as soon as you walk through Susan's Fish n Chips doors you know your in Portland Maine. Really good seafood and priced fair. I felt this sense of history as we sat at our table. Between the old pictures of fishermen, shark jaws strung along the walls and ceiling with fish netting and the aroma of sea food sizzling away, I truly felt proud to be a Mainah.
This was my first time checking in and it won't be my last. Been driving by this place for years and years. Maybe the small parking lot was what kept me away? Anyway, it doesn't matter. You know why?  Fried lobster tail on a stick with a side of butter. That's why :)"
1777,Ehhh!!! Not great. The fish & chips were just ok. Onion rings...raw fat onion rings burnt on the outside. Calimari....gross!!! Chowder heated in the microwave hot on top cold on the bottom. Would not recommend and will not return.
1778,"Ohhhhh myyyy.   I've had lots of fish and chips all over the US, and this place kicks all those others' a**.   The fish is flaky, the batter just right. Fries are good.  They have onion rings.  We'll try those another visit.  They'll be plenty more visits."
1779,Fresh and low key. Where the locals get their fried fish. In a weird location on outer forest ave but worth the drive if you are hankering for simply delicious fried stuff
1780,"Location || not the greatest. Hidden and blends in with the auto shop next door on a corner spot. Inside was very simple. Picnic benches around the space with order at the counter service. 

Food || we got the fish and chips and lobster roll. Fish and chips were awesome. Very flaky fish and the tartar sauce was delicious. The meal came with three small pieces of fish and fries. Lobster roll was not great but not bad either. There was no seasoning or sauce in the lobster roll. Literally cut up lobster on a potato roll. Wish there was something that had a bit of crunch to it. We also got two cups of soup: shrimp corn chowder and bacon scallop chowder. Shrimp corn chowder was delicious with a bit of a kick. Bacon scallop chowder was great as well. Had a lot of meat which I appreciate. Coffee was also free so definitely a plus during these cold days. 

Price || about average price. Fish and chips were about $11, lobster roll was $14 and each soup (size small) was $3.99"
1781,"This place has been there forever and I want to tried it. I finally have the time to go tried it. I order Haddock and chip, I didn't like it at all, because it is tasteless and fishery. The haddock are previous frozen and you can smell before you tastes it. the fries are supper dried. Not worth it to come. Back second time."
1782,The onion rings and coleslaw were very delicious. The fish and chips were pretty good. Nice and flaky. My husband had the haddock nuggets. Those were tasty. The people were very friendly and very helpful. Good service.
1783,"Don't let the fact that it's back off the waterfront deter you from visiting. Susan's has interesting decor and the staff was friendly and helpful. 
The cod and haddock were both tasty and there's free coffee for all."
1784,"Ordered a seafood combo platter with fries and a seafood chowder. The chowder was fine/good value for what we paid and it tasted good. However the seafood combo platter wasn't good and tasted off. The shrimp seemed to be small popcorn shrimp that could have come from a frozen bag. The haddock nuggets has no real taste. The clam and scallops had an awkward/grimy taste. Maybe they weren't cleaned enough but it didn't taste like typical fried clam strips/scallops. Tasted too fishy. Would not recommend.

Service was fine, staff was nice but food was not up to expectations and not what the other reviews have indicated."
1785,"Was disappointed by all the hype this places gets, only good thing is the fresh fish! Beyond that a bland cornmeal based coating deep fried. Portions we generous but had to peel most of the coating off, too heavy. Interesting atmosphere and good service"
1786,"At first I was thrown off by the appearance of this establishment but once I found out the Phantom Gourmet had eaten here, I thought it would be a diamond in the rough.
I was wrong. Fresh lobster is the best part of this experience...fries were so overdone and tasted like peanut oil, they were almost inedible. The restaurant is attached to a garage (think oil changes and tire rotations) and smelled strongly of oil. Not very appetizing.
I was disappointed by this experience"
1787,A little gem on the side of the road that shares an old automotive garage with an actual repair shop but it's separated. Features fish shack decor and picnic tables inside with a fast casual atmosphere. We got the clams with fries and coke slaw and a burger (child). First let me say the burger was great for a fish place. But the Star was the seafood our clams were second to bobs   Fries were delicious. Definetly will return.
1788,Great food great prices just very dirty inside. Restrooms are gross dirty floors dirty walls come on clean it up we are eating there!
1789,"3.5 stars

Stopped by Susan's Fish & Chips for our last dinner in Maine since we were looking for clam chowder somewhere relatively close to our hotel. Private parking lot which fits roughly 5-6 cars.

Combo (choice of any two items) Dinner Plate ($14.99): Opted for the calamari and shrimp with a side of french fries. Starred at all the fried food when it arrived and I already felt my heart burning! I took out about 70% of the batter since it was a little much.


Small clam chowder ($2.99): Yum - The consistency isn't as thick as I normally like my clam chowder, but you could definitely tell the soup isn't from a Campbell's can! 
I ask Susan for recommendations for my choice of two items on the dinner plate. She wasn't helpful and just said that ""it depends"" and ""everything is good."" I understand as the owner you would say everything is good, but can't you at least give a customer your recommendation?!

2 dinner plates, 2 small clam chowder, and 2 small drinks for $41 pre-tax."
1790,"Went with a friend and we both got a lobster roll and fries. I love soggy fries and they were delicious. Lobster was definitely not fresh which is a bummer considering how close they are to the harbor. I got the fish chowder and my buddy got the clam chowder and we both agree it was ""tasteless."" Prices were fair $15 for lobster roll/fries and $3.99 for a cup of chowder. Place was very hot and outside was in direct sun so we sat inside. Pepsi products, not coke so thumbs down on that. Service was a bit slow but people wee pleasant."
1791,"Open year round, always fun and satisfying. Good, honest, hot and crispy local clams and succulent lobster rolls, also great chowder. Seafaring and quirky ambience, fun for kids. Casual and relaxing."
1792,I love Susan's  the  batter  is amazing  love the fish sandwiches all the food is great  great food good prices
1793,"Food is awesome, staff is great. I'm local & I love that so many locals come here for just real good food & it's not swamped with tourists. But if the tourists do their research & find this place, they're lucky. Also, the cheeseburger is really good too! I always get the scallop dinner."
1794,"Susan's was amazing!  Being from the South, I like my seafood Fried and I know when a place gets it right.  Susan's is very casual no frills laid back place and feels like a neighborhood local spot.  You can see them fixing your order right there battering & frying it up.  We got lots of food for the price and it was fresh.  We also got a fried banana split dessert that was great!  It was so good we went twice on our trip to Maine.  I definitely recommend it!"
1795,"First saw this place in a video on Facebook and thought why not go check it out since its pretty close. 

We ordered two lobster rolls and a small bacon scallop soup (I think that's what it was)- and it was soooo good! The prices are extremely reasonable, just wish that we got bigger portions for the lobster rolls (but for the price I can't complain that much). 

The seating was a little cramped, only because of how busy it was. And the parking was a PAIN. (Worth it though)"
1796,"This is definitely a local kind of place. If I didn't know better, I would have assumed la Urbana took cue from this place and convert a garage to make a restaurant.  We stopped by Susan's for a quick dinner in Portland, ME but wanted something that's more of a local flavor and Susan's was it. 

With their home made tartar sauce to a very attentive service, the fish they've used here is fresh. The best part from my meal is actually their Coleslaw. I don't usually like coleslaws but at Susan's the seasoning they've used in the making of their slaw is savory and quite tasty. Unfortunately, the only way of cooking at Susan's is fried but the Fish N Chip is a good option here."
1797,"After horrible news I decided I needed something to pick me up. My roommate told me this was the best place to eat your sorrow away and I needed it. I also held up traffic because it's IMMEDIATELY after the car wash places. 

After I parked my car, I was greeted immediately by the cashier and she even helped me with my order. I ordered the lobster roll and also chowder. Both was great and enjoyed it very much. 

Next time you want to drown away the sorrow in the middle of the day, come and drown away on a roll."
1798,"I had a seafood crave last night and didn't feel like eating leftovers.  Susan's Fish n Chips came to mind and phoned in a takeout order. The lady over the phone was very nice and offered to give us additional cocktail and tartar sauce! I always pass by this restaurant whenever I am running errands and decided to give this place a shot. Boy o Boy, I'm extremely glad that I did so. 

Appearance:
As I entered Susan's, I noticed that there were picnic tables, a couple of booths setback and free coffee at the register.  Even though I can't have coffee, it's nice that it's free to patrons!  Behind the register, you're actually able to see how the food is made which is great news for me.  It was an assembly line with seafood ready to be coated with their delicious batter, then fried to a golden crisp.

Taste:
I ordered take out which consisted of a small clam chowder, calamari plate, and the fish and chips plate.  The clam chowder was really creamy, had chunks of potatoes, and little pieces of clams.  I ended up adding black pepper to give it a kick!  Both dinner entrees came with fries which weren't salty thankfully and small tubs of coleslaw.  Sometimes, coleslaw can taste spoiled or just really watery.....but not this coleslaw!! It was seasoned just right and every bite was fresh and yummy.  The fish and chips plate was humongous....3 big pieces of fish which I shared with my boyfriend because I couldn't finish it! The batter on the fish was out of this world amazing and enjoyed every bite.  I tried some of my boyfriend's calamari and it tasted just as good!

Customer Service:
The ladies at the front were so lovely and patient.  I couldn't ask for better service!"
1799,"I drive by Susan's fish n' chips all of the time and have never been in. Last weekend was my husbands day to pick where we are for lunch and this is where we slender up. 
It was a lot bigger inside than I thought it was going to be, lots of seating and pretty clean. Sometimes places with lots of decorations end up feeling dirty from lack of dusting, it didn't feel that way in here.
The people working there were super nice! They loved talking to my ten month old and made us feel very welcome. They let me switch out onion rings for fries so that always makes me happy.
The food was great! My husband got a fishermans platter, it pretty much came with everything! The scallops, shrimp, haddock and clams were friend with a light and crispy batter that was just great. Fries were on the bottom so they got a litter soggy, eh. My lobster roll was great, I asked for no relish/mayo since the lobster wasn't dressed. I did get a small cup of butter on the side to dump all over the top. I got onion rings on the side and they were awesome, same light batter. We got a side of friend pickles that were also great. 
My one COMPLAINT is that the ketchup tasted funky. They had ketchup on the table in red ketchup squeeze bottles. It tasted like bread and butter pickles with a hint or tomato. Weird, I know. I don't use any other dipping sauces so this kind of screwed up my fried food I wanted to dip and ketchup. My husband couldn't taste it l, but he is not a ketchup person like myself. He does call me the blood hound because I can smell and taste everything, so maybe it's my fault for having such strong taste buds.
Our meal and experience was great I'll just bring my own ketchup next time. Keep it up Susan's!"
1800,"I think this place is decent. I just was underwhelmed, as was my partner. They have been around forever and the yelp reviews are good, so I went in search of a place I passed all the time on dreaded forest ave.  I enjoyed the no frills decor. They fried everything perfectly; it was not greasy at all. For $47, with tip, we got two lobster rolls with fries and a side of fried calamari. I was at first happy with the roll, bc I didn't note any mayo. But eventually I found it globbed on to bottom of roll. That ruined the underwhelming lobster for me (it just didn't have much flavor). The fried calamari also had no flavor. I've definitely had worse, so I wouldn't discount this place. But I wouldn't come here if expecting your tastebuds to thank you. Admittedly, I rarely eat fried food. But my metric when I do is to think after the meal: was it worth the calories and eventual upset tummy I will have!? Sadly, this place was not."
1801,"Perhaps a bold statement, but imo best seafood in Portland area. Offers a plethora of selection and it was delicious!"
1802,"Phenomenal clam chowder! Just that alone should be enough to get you here! It may look a little suspicious, but it's the perfect place to get good seafood at a decent price."
1803,"After a long day of travel, was interested in a ""to go"" order of seafood...checked reviews and gave Susan's a try. Ordered a combo with haddock and clams. The fish was very, very good - really enjoyed. The clams however, were a bit strong tasting, not sweet. Fries were average at best. The really disappointment was the fish chowder. Basically a cup ok milk with fish chunks...no flavor and as thin as it could get. Not a fan of this chowder at all. Cole slaw had little flavor also...so get the haddock if you go, but probably better choices available..."
1804,"All around good seafood and friendly staff.  Heavily breaded, solid sides, interesting outdoor seating.  Good for takeout too"
1805,"A native Mainah who has lived and traveled all over, my biggest treat is going back to New England for my guilty pleasure - fried clams. In town with my son for a quick weekend getaway, we tried this place on a whim based upon some good reviews. THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! It's definitely not fancy looking. But, the clams were awesome and the price can't be beat. It's your typical seafood shack brought indoors - picnic tables, some shoreside chatchki hanging around on the walls etc. The people were nice and the food great! If you're looking for some delicious fried seafood at a great price in a casual atmosphere - give it a try - the awards hanging on the walls all around are well deserved. Definitely will be back."
1806,"For the longest time I avoided this place. Partly based on the look from the outside, being attached to a car garage and from some less then stellar reviews from past co-workers. My father had been helping me with things around the house and suggested going here as he always wanted to try it. I figured it was time to put up or shut up and to give this place a try. 

I am glad I did. 

The food was super affordable (30 dollars for 3 people) and pretty good. That being said most of the options here involve lowering an dead ocean dwelling animal into a deep fryer but the quality of the shrimp (I ordered) and fish (my parents) was great. The gallon of tarter sauce that you get is good but for the love of your cholesterol use sparingly. The coleslaw was so so. 

The inside is pretty tacky and dated but the reason you are going to Susan's is not for the ambiance (Or maybe that is your thing, i.e. Bubbas Sulky Lounge)

The food is great, the staff are friendly and enjoyed (dealing with) my father chatting with them. 

While not glitzy like some downtown Commercial St. establishment the rhymes with Moone's Mish Mouse and Mouster Room, the food is quality and priced correctly. 

While I was busy tossing shrimp down, the line that popped into my head from the show about a famous yellow family with only four fingers was:

""'Tis no man, 'tis a remorseless eatin' machine"" 

Susan's, please never become all you can eat."
1807,"Susan's is a mom-and-pop-style casual place that offers a taste of Portland at a more than reasonable price! The menu is extensive with options that start around $2! On Monday's and Tuesday's, dominate the market by scooping up their 2 for $2.50 fish sandwiches! Add a side of fries or crab cakes along with a side of chowder for less than $10! The wait is usually short if you get there at the right time and I always appreciate the free coffee. Gems like this just don't exist anymore and I hope this family run spot keeps its traditional vibe for as long as they can."
1808,Best fish fry I've ever had. Located in a renovated garage it could use AC but still a terrific place.
1809,"I visited on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend at 1:00. No line! (A good line started at 1:30). Very friendly counter service. Susan herself made my fish and chips, which tasted great. There was a big bottle of tartar on the table (I usually can't get enough at other restaurants.) the place is very casual with a small counter area and several picnic tables. My meal was $10.99. Onion ring looked great, although I didn't order any."
1810,"It's ok, but not terrific. Meals were somewhat reasonably priced, the clam strips had 3x more breading than meat, and the coleslaw was too peppery. Low key location right next to a garage with limited parking"
1811,"After a crap meal at another seafood place we decided to try one more place while vacationing in Maine. We drove to Susan's and say in the parking lot for 5 minutes trying to decide if we wanted to go in or not due to the pretty sketchy exterior. Haha. I'm glad we went it. 

It's a smaller mom and pop joint that's super relaxed with good food.  It's inexpensive and that's always a plus!"
1812,"2012: $2.50 for 2 freshly fried fish sandwiches
2015: STILL $2.50 for 2 freshly fried fish sandwiches!

I used to enjoy coming here a few years back, and somewhere along the way, I must have forgotten about it. Over this past summer, I found myself feeling almost desperately broke again, and now I'm back! While the rest of the menu is decently priced, I'm usually here for the fish sandwich deal on Mondays and Tuesdays. The folks are friendly, and there's free coffee while you wait. I used to love McDonalds Filet O Fish back in the day, but Susan's wins hands down, any day."
1813,"Every time I go to Maine I have to get a plate of little fried bay shrimp, and this is some of the best I've ever had. Very generous portion, too. I would go out of my way to come here again if I were in the Portland area."
1814,"One of our family's favorite go-to places for fresh fried seafood! My favorite is their fried smelt, but their haddock sandwiches are consistently fresh and tasty. We bring out of towners here for a taste of Maine. There is no water view and the decor is dated and kitschy, but it is unpretentious . That's the true Maine way!"
1815,"Last night I tried Fisherman's Grill. And while it may superficially look divey, it really isn't.

Susan's is. In the best way possible. 

Situated next to an auto mechanic on Forest Ave, this is the ultimate Portland seafood dive. Parking is easy and the building itself is surprisingly large. Inside are many long benches for communal seating, along with a few booths. There's a large outdoor area with picnic tables in the summer. You order at the counter (they do accept credit cards), give your name, and they bring your food.

The decorations are random, to say the least. Puzzles, stuffed animals, basically anything they could find they threw up on the wall. Why not, right? The menu is what you would expect (all of the fried seafood staples) with a few surprises. The fried veggie boat is deliciously greasy, as are the fried pickles.

I'm not sure exactly if it's a written-down policy, but Susan's is BYOB. On Monday and Tuesday nights the special is $2.50 for 2 fried fish sandwiches. And they're not tiny. An order of that, a bottle of wine from home, and cribbage, may be the perfect capper to a Monday workday.

Everything at Susan's oozes value. The lobster roll is $11 and comes with fries. Maybe it's not the very best in the state, but lobster is lobster. There is no better deal. This is cheap, semi-greasy, but fresh, seafood. It gives a giant middle finger to Street and Company. But the service is great, so with a smile."
1816,"Tried this off of reviews while in the area. The people were friendly and accommodating even while lines out the door. Unfortunately, the scallops got over cooked on the seafood platter. Clam chowder and fish chowder delicious.... clam was more flavorful.  Portion size was huge and more than enough for 3 people! I prefer a lighter batter. This is fairly thick and heavy. Very good overall."
1817,Fish chowder was really runny and watery. Fish and chips were flavorless and soggy. Not good at all
1818,"The place looks like a dive but it is SO GOOD. Be adventurous and go in. You won't be sorry. Let's start with the chowder. There were 4 different kinds available, one of which was vegetarian, and they all sounded amazing. I had the scallop and bacon chowder. So flavorful and was the perfect consistency, not too thin, not too thick. Then I had a combo plate, fried scallops and fried haddock split, with fries and coleslaw. The fries could have used some salt but otherwise this was an excellent meal. The girl at the counter also asked me if I wanted one or two tartar sauces because she ""is a dipper and would want two."" A girl after my own heart. I took two :) Overall excellent service and fantastic food, a little so so on the atmosphere but what they lack in atmosphere they more than make up for in quality food that is tasty AF! Try them out!"
1819,When in Rome you must eat seafood or something like that. In Portland and went to Yelp for help to find solid Portland chow. After watching a video and reading about Susan's figured I needed to give it a go. Don't blink or you might miss the joint sharing a plot with an auto shop. Once inside no frills but nicely fried seafood. My choice was the cod and clams and they were nicely fried with a light but well coated batter. Standard fries and cole slaw accompany most plates. Not the best fried seafood I have ever had but it is in the top 10.
1820,"Had a real nice late lunch. Fried oyster and scallops with French fries. The coleslaw was just ok, but the clam chowder was excellent. I would surely go back."
1821,"I really like this place. It's simple, no-frills dining, but they do it very well. I had some of the freshest and most tender fried calamari I've ever had, generously portioned at a reasonable price. The fried fish dish that my friend got was huge, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The tartar sauce is nice and tangy, and their clam chowder is yummy too albeit not the best in the city. Our only complaint was that the fries were not that crispy and could have been better salted, but the seafood is excellent.

The place is located in a giant renovated garage, and you seat yourself. Don't expect there to be silverware and tablecloths, but appreciate the fact that they're battering and frying your seafood right in front of you."
1822,"possibly the best fish and chip in Portland, ME,or at the very least the best fried fish!! 
The fish in the fish and chip dinnah not dinner :) is fresh, moist , perfectly fried thick fillet of fish. It is just plain yummy. 
I had a small order of scallop and bacon chowdah. It was hot and good. The family all got different seafood and we all  shared a little bit of each : calamari, clams ( full bellied), scallops, shrimps, and fish. My next favorite is the scallops. Fried perfectly, sweet and juicy.
The fried full bellied clams are just as good. These are my three favorite in descending order:  Fish, Scallops, and Full bellied clams. If you like any of the mentioned three fried, you definitely should try it here. 
The front of restaurant might be something that you may pass  but once you stepped in, you will be glad you did. 
Remember the old saying never judge a book by its cover. 
They even have fried ice cream."
1823,"Great food for the price! We walked in and were treated like regulars right from the start. Since it was our first time here as well as to the area they helped us pick out the perfect dishes and boy they did NOT disappoint! We got Lobstah rolls ( delish), fish n chips, crab cakes, fried shrimp roll and hot dogs ( for the little ones). There wasn't an empty plate! We even saved room for fried ice cream!
The cooks and cashier were super friendly and we enjoyed chatting with them throughout our meal. We are SO happy we stumbled upon this place! I highly recommend it! Great for families!"
1824,"Susan's Fish n' Chips was great. There is very limited parking and the restaurant is on a very busy street, but I'm glad I went! It is a very causal place with picnic table seating. 

We visited on our way to Allagash Brewery(~10 minutes away) and ate a seafood platter and lobster roll. Both were delicious. The lobster roll was overflowing with lobster and came with a side of drawn butter and fries. The seafood platter had fried scallops, shrimp, haddock, clam strips, and whole bellied clams along with fries and coleslaw."
1825,"3.5 stars

When you first walk in to Susan's you get a very friendly greeting.  The menu is a little overwhelming especially if you are indecisive like me.  We decided to try the fried pickles and mushrooms.  Both were good.  We also got the seafood platter which included haddock, baby shrimps, scallops, clams and we upgraded to onion rings.  We also got the lobster roll with French fries.  

The scallops were my favorite and the clams were a close second.  The fish was good as well.  The baby shrimps were a little too small they were the size of maybe a dime.  The cocktail sauce was very tasty but I thought the tarter sauce wasn't as good.  

The lobster roll kind of disappointed.  It was kind of bland but fresh.  I have a heavy taste bud so just not enough taste for me.  

The staff made the experience very pleasant.

No major complaints but nothing stood out.

Enjoy!"
1826,"I ate here tonight. Fried clams were delicious, service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back."
1827,"Hands down, the best fried clams, fish and chips and scallops i have ever had. This is the local place that you have been looking for"
1828,It was alright. Fisherman's Grill still reigns supreme. Prices were good. Took forever and a day for the order to be prepared. Workers were friendly enough.
1829,"Doesn't deserve the one star that I had to give them. The so called world famous chowder is not edible, it was flavorless and microwaved. The two fish sandwich special on Monday and Tuesday for $2.50 are not as good as McDonalds and forget about the overpriced lobster rolls they are just not good. I think the positive reviewers of this very dirty place are either paid for their reviews or employees. Come on Susan's your on the Maine coast and you can't do better than this, you should be ashamed of the food you put out."
1830,"This place was a ""Bucklet List"" type of place! Because we are from Utah and traveling across the country with my wife and 3 kids! First  I'm going to list the good things about this restaurant. The food was hot and made to order!  Now I will list the things that I thought was wrong with the place! 1st thing the staff was not inviting at all everybody seem like this was the worst day to come in for work we were not greeted when we came into the restaurant by anybody. We ordered the fish-and-chips and the fish burgers which was actually pretty good but when I approached the counter to get a few extra things I noticed the cook and his assistant or the other cook did not have on gloves  And he was doing 3 different things at one time cooking food, washing dishes, and texting on his phone because the place wasn't busy and the owner wasn't there but the straw that broke the camel's back was when he was toasting some buns for me he wipes sweat from his head and touch my buns with his bare hands completely  Disgusting so I can imagine handle all the food with his sweaty hands! I feel I was overcharge because I paid $25 for some sweaty food if I wouldn't knew this guy was sitting there prepare food without gloves on playing with switch I would never set out to eat at this establishment! I really hate that the owner Susan wasn't there because I will hope that she don't run this place like that! All in all I would say maybe eat there but make sure the cook is not plan with sweat on his head or washing dishes while preparing  Your food! The God with the glasses Shouldn't be a cook I'm done!"
1831,"This place is a fried seafood go to....get past the sketchy exterior....it's good value and decent fish...

The fish and chips are excellent and a good portion....the haddock sandwich a popular favorite....good fresh haddock...nice portion....decent ciabatta roll..

The lobster roll is $12 and delivers lots of lobster for the price. The tarter is in a big canning jar....help yourself....

Nice staff....good value....nothing fancy....4 stars for value and decent product."
1832,"Based on the food quality, I cannot give anything above 2 stars. We ordered fish-n-chips, fried whole clams, fried oysters, and clam chowder. Everything was off. The clam chowder had a subtle sour taste. The coleslaw was mushy instead of crunchy. For fried food to be good, the ratio of flour batter to meat is key. The flour was too thick. I felt like I was eating fried flour batter instead of clams or oysters. Fish-n-chips were the best compared to other dishes. However, its best was just average compared to other fish-n-chips. Fresh seafood has subtle sweetness. There were none in any seafood. At the end of the meal, there was still a lot of food left, not because I was full, but because they were not good. I was planned to order fried ice cream but after the meal, I lost all confidence of the kitchen and decided to skip it."
1833,This is the best lobster roll I've ever had. I've been to Susan's twice in the past year when I've traveled to Portland for work and both times my experience was excellent. The lobster roll and fries is a perfect meal. You order at the counter. You get fast friendly service. And the atmosphere inside the restaurant is very authentic. I will keep returning to Susan's when I visit Portland.
1834,Really enjoyed the fish and chips. They are also very kid friendly. They have a little kids area with coloring books and stuff while you wait for the food. Staff was super friendly as well! Glad we stopped her on our Maine trip!
1835,"I love this little seafood spot in a converted garage. They serve tartar sauce in jars so you never have to ask for more. The portions are huge and the prices are right. 

You order at the counter and find a seat and wait for the fresh cooked to order meal to arrive. The mixed seafood basket was delicious and filling."
1836,Best fried clams I ever had. Kind of a hidden gem. The fried clams are my favorite in the northeast. I have not tried the lobster roll so I can comment on that. But the clams and haddock are great.
1837,"I am a little surprised that none of the reviews mention how filthy this place is. Grimy carpet, dirty sticky tables, and everything just, well, gross. We ordered the standard fish and chips and the food was fine. Three smallish nuggets of fish in a good batter. The fries were ok... a little limp, but fine. But honestly, it was hard to enjoy the food. I am not opposed to a funky atmosphere, but straight up dirty is another matter."
1838,"This place is a-ok.. I enjoyed the crunch of the batter on my fried fish.. Fish tastes mild.. Fries are average.. Tartar sauce is tangy.. It's a solid spot for that fish n chips craving.. And I like how the inside of the restaurant is an auto body shop.. The casual ambience is very fitting. They also sell ice cream, sundaes, a fried banana dessert and frappes.. Didn't get to try those tho."
1839,"Susan's has a great crew! Very good fish & chips, my favorite is the ""fish burger"" (AKA haddock sandwich)
Maybe suggest the smaller ""fish burgers two for $2.50"" split it with your friend so as to try a fried veggie platter or other choices!"
1840,"When I saw Susan's on the top 10 lobster rolls list, I decided to stop by. As soon as I stepped in, I knew this place would be a hit or a miss: a family owned hole in the wall restaurant that lives up to the hype or an overrated restaurant that happened to make it to the top 10 list annnd it turned out to be the latter...The lobster rolls were plain jane, the fried shrimp were tiny, the cocktail sauce tasted like horseradish, and the cole slaw was too creamy. The fish and chips were good though, the fish was battered well. If you're lookong for the best lobster rolls in Maine, I'm sorry but you definitely won't find it here."
1841,"As far as seafood in Portland, Maine goes, this place lives at the intersection of great quality and affordability.  Located at Morrill's Corner - far away from the roaming Old Port tourists - this is your salt of the earth seafood place, without all the frills you might find at Eventide or Street & Co in the Old Port.  It's even located in what appears to be a converted auto repair garage, so it has all the ambience that one can expect in that type of establishment.  

Their fare is comparable to other seafood places; they have all the baskets and combos that one can expect.  Their lobster rolls are very good and surprisingly affordable, about 2--30% less than what you can expect to pay closer to the Old Port. What also sets this place apart from other seafood restaurants is that they attempt to offer a few vegetarian options on their menu.  I believe they had battered and deep fried veggies last time I was in.  I'm not sure I'd go as far as to say it's great for vegetarians, but it's worth checking out their specials first before vetoing.

I usually only go here (or eat seafood) on special occasions because the friend nature of the food tends to make for an incredibly heavy meal, however everything I've had here has tasted fresh and has been very well prepared.  If you're in the 'hood and looking to pay less for great Maine seafood, trust in this place."
1842,"Borderline 3.5. 

Super dive-y seashore type vibe in this Forest Avenue spot, but I was into it. It is definitely a bit grimy, so brace yourself for some CARPETED floors (WHAT!), sticky tables and all that noise, but my food was top notch.  I had a gigantic combination platter with fried clams and fried shrimp. The shrimp were baby shrimp and so teeny that I barely tasted them, but the clams were perfect and in general they were battered and fried to perfection.  It comes with a little container of coleslaw and the option of fries, macaroni or potato salad - I was offered zero of these options though.  I saw on the menu they were choices, but she never asked and I didn't really care, but the older, whiter, presumably more regulars who came after me were offered all the options.  Don't think I'm not noticing. 

My boyfriend had the haddock burger and we split a clam chowder.  You get a gigantic mason jar of tartar sauce, and I have a feeling a lot of the regulars here slurp that right up. They offer some crazy fish burger special on M/Tues - 2 for $2.50? The lady behind me tried to order it, but was told today was Wednesday and was offered up some other specials.

I wouldn't mess with a lobster roll here, unless I brought the lobster in myself, so if that's what you're looking for, Fisherman's Grill is just down the road, and their lobster roll is ridiculously good.

Thought the food was good, but the overall vibe was weird.  This lady kept giving me the stink eye/freak face EVERY time we made eye contact - my boyfriend said he caught it too and thought that was her regular stank face - and we were not given a fond farewell like every one else was when they left. That could just be coincidence, but that's not my favorite kind of dive feel. 

You're lucky I'm rating up for food alone."
1843,"Lobster rolls were good but not overflowing as you would think by others pictures because there is lettuce and mayo fluffing up the bottom of the roll. Great price though for the lobster rolls but I'm not a fan of mayo at all personally

Clam chowder wasn't as thick as I would like but still good quality good amount of clams to each bite. Unfortunately the first spoon fulls my boyfriend and I took had cold potatoes still but after a little stir of our own it all evened out the temp. That mean the chowder was just microwaved? Not sure but still not lacking on the quality of the clams.

Good pricing in my opinion with 2 lobster rolls, a medium clam chowder and medium fountain drink for $32

We did get there very shortly after they opened for a Saturday morning so will give another try again for a mid-day. Deserving of the 4 stars now, 3 - 3 1/2 stars if the chowder still has a cold spot next time"
1844,"Stumbled upon this place while driving outside downtown Portland, and it's a gem! The pricing is pretty awesome compared to other seafood places (nothing really more than $15) which is great. I'm a clam chowder fanatic, and the chowder here is fantastic! Plus, they have a bread bowl option that's really filling and affordable, so I definitely recommend that if you're a chowder fan like me.

Most of the food is fried, so if that's up your alley, you'll absolutely love this place. I highly recommend the fried clams with the homemade tartar sauce, but I've heard that the lobster roll is delicious too. 

The service is really quick, and they serve free coffee throughout the day. I'll definitely come back here if I have the time, especially because the food is so affordable! Worth the drive out of downtown!"
1845,"So glad that Susan's stays open past the summer/fall season! We visited in November and had a great time enjoying the delicious New England cuisine. The restaurant is very Maine with a no frills design, and cute antique flares here and there. I especially liked the vintage booths in the back. 

We tried the lobster rolls, French fries, fried pickles and clam chowder. The lobster roll was my favorite. The fresh roll was stuffed with lobster meat and had hardly any mayo on it. The clam chowder was great as well, especially on a cold day. The fried pickles and French fries were pretty good but they could have used a little more flavor. All of the food was very reasonably priced. I was definitely impressed with the quality of the food for the price. Susan's also offers free coffee to all patrons. I appreciated this because I was put into a mild food coma after overindulging in all of the delicious food here!"
1846,"Great food and very reasonably priced! The service was so very friendly and efficient! I waited at most 5 minutes for a lobster roll, it was fresh and the fries were hot and crispy.  I would recommend to anyone!"
1847,"Great fish! Fast service! I would go back again. There is seating out back for when it's too hot inside. I had the haddock and fries, and my husband had the scallops and fries. Both meals were very good and big in size. The staff was very friendly and very helpful."
1848,"Come get your own fresh caught fish fried up, or get a bite of the tasty Haddock and fries! Delicious, home cooked fried fish. I don't need to go anywhere else for my seafood! It's perfect here."
1849,Yet again I call susans for takeout and they ask if this is mary and how have I been....seriously makes me feel so good when people actually care and you can really taste the love in every bite of their food. I'm in the food business and try to do that with my customers....I feel it really matters. Food=love and susans has both. Seafood platter and a large order of onion rings is where at! Order it...now!
1850,"Yep twofer fish sandwiches are $2.50 for two on Mondays and Tuesday.
Great deal and great sandwich."
1851,You don't come for the atmosphere.  You don't come for the great location(unless youre getting your car worked on next door).  You come for those fried clams and fish.  Dem things done right.
1852,Best seafood around! Back to back years we have made sure to come to Susan's fish and chips for seafood. The haddock nuggets and lobstah rolls are amazing! Coleslaw is tasty good. What amazing food! We visited multiple times on our trip!
1853,"I ordered the Fish-n-Chips. It was perfectly fried, the crust was nice and flaky, but it was lacking a bit of seasoning. The tartar sauce that came with it was nice. My favorite part of the whole meal was coleslaw. I typically don't eat coleslaw, but I finished this one."
1854,"After meeting fellow Yelp Eliter, Brett (who's 5-Star Review is also here), who suggested ""Bite Into Maine"" after being asked, ""What's the best lobster roll you've ever had"", I HAD TO TRY IT. 

I already love the fact that they have winter specials Tues to Thur. Tue: BOGO 50% off on sandwiches (so you're basically paying a little less than $30 for TWO lobster rolls), Wed: $~15 Lobster Rolls, and to my delight on Thur: ~$20 for a roll AND soup.

They do not have fries here, but they DO have other sides and so much more on the menu! They have a variety of lobster rolls too! I stuck with the classic. I ordered the Lobster Bisque and the Maine Style Lobster Roll. 

The Lobster Bisque - I've had plenty in my lifetime, but this is BY FAR one of THE best bisques I've ever had! The cream in the bisque is perfectly proportioned with the rest of the ingredients in the soup. Sometimes, restaurants either put too much or too little of something that offsets how a lobster bisque should taste. Instead, Bite into Maine has mastered their recipe to where a cup of soup can warm your soul with every bite. 

Next, the Maine Style Lobster Roll. I've never had a lobster roll that is perfectly proportioned to my liking. Starting with the outside, I like that there's enough of the bun to not feel like you have too much/little. I also like that they follow my cardinal rule of having my buns slightly toasted in order for happy consumption. Quantity: they are definitely not greedy with their lobster. You have such a perfect amount, that you can actually scrape off a top layer of the roll, and STILL have a perfectly proportioned bun:lobster ratio. The amount of mayo they use in the lobster mix is also perfect! I hate when lobster rolls have wayyy too much mayo that it overpowers the taste of the lobster. Yes, you can ACTUALLY taste the lobster-- butter is not lobster!!

I'm not sure HOW they do it, but I am one of the most critical (yet happiest) little humans on the planet, and the word 'perfect' is certainly synonymous to Bite Into Maine. A++"
1855,"Since it's winter and their trailers are closed (more of a classic experience in my head), we came to the Scarborough shop for our Maine lobster roll. 

We ordered the Maine style lobster roll, which is Maine lobster with mayo and chives on a buttered and toasted top sliced bun. 
The lobster roll was so so delicious. Perfectly fresh and tasty lobster, just the right amount of mayo (enough to give it the texture, but not mayo flavor), freshness from the chives, and a perfectly toasted and buttery roll. 

We also had the lobster Mac grilled cheese, basically a combination of their lobster grilled cheese and their lobster Mac and cheese. It was very good, but we'd wished it had a little more lobster. We didn't mind it too much since we had the lobster roll as well, but something to consider if ordering it alone. 

Such a good classic lobster roll - a must do in Maine. I look forward to visiting their Cape Elizabeth trailer in the summer!"
1856,"This is the best lobster roll in the Portland area and likely the best I've ever had, anywhere. It's better than Red's even, and an argument could be made that it's the best lobster roll in the world. It feels ridiculous writing those words, but it is entirely plausible.

This is their year round location just a few minutes from Portland, with a more expansive menu than the food trucks. There is no atmosphere here whatsoever. There's two tables and some counter seating. No alcohol is served. But it doesn't even matter. Several styles of lobster roll are available in a regular (around $17) or extra large (same roll, just more lobster meat and around $23). The best is the Maniac, an off menu option. It's a heavily buttered and grilled bun stuffed with lobster meat, a thin layer of coleslaw, chives, melted butter and mayo. It's perfect, and is the rare decadent calorie bomb that's actually worth it. There's also lobster grilled cheese and lobster mac and cheese for $15. Both are excellent, but not world class like the roll.

I can't emphasize enough how great this place is. We ate at HighRoller two nights ago, which was comparatively horrendous. It's embarrassingly bad next to Bite Into Maine. Eventide last night was very good, but $15 buys you two bites. I feel like no one knows this location exists. Maybe I should keep it a secret, but I won't. If you like lobster rolls, come here now. Enough said."
1857,"It was a cold and snowy day and I wanted lobster, but I also wanted something warm. On the suggestion of a fellow Yelper, I decided to stop by Bite Into Maine. The grilled cheese with lobster was so good, with large chunks of lobster and warm, gooey cheese. Insane.

They also have multiple styles of lobster rolls, with various toppings: wasabi, curry, and chipotle mayo. And don't forget the soups and chowders: clam, seafood, and lobster bisque. 

More important than all of the delicious food mentioned above is the service. I was immediately greeted when I walked in and the young man  stepped out from behind the counter to give me my to go order with a genuine smile. Good service always wins me over. 

The place is a perfect addition to Scarborough."
1858,"This is why I was excited about traveling here. 

For starters, I wondered if lobster rolls were cheaper than they are in Chicago. (They are, but only by about 5 bucks.) Most importantly, I wanted  to know how much better it tasted.

The answer is: it tastes way better! Bite of Maine has found the right way to serve fresh, cold lobster within a warm, crispy, perfectly sized roll. And it helps that there was tons of it, too. Being in Maine I got it Maine-style, although had I known that it was my only lobster roll of the trip, I would've opted to get the butter-drizzled roll instead. 

Still this roll was fantastic, with the mayo creamy but relatively light, and the chives mostly staying out of the way of the star of the show; the lobster.

My wife got clam chowder as well, which was most definitely fresh judging by the (tiny) amount of grit in the clams. It was refreshing and further proof that New England is the place for seafood.

A great first meal and definitely the place to be for seafood!"
1859,"I believe it was Dave Matthews who once famously sung ""Biiitteeee into ME"". Or was it crash? Either way, he was definitely talking about this lobster roll. As a born and bred Mainer, I'm not easily impressed by a lobster roll, especially one that cost $16. It better be a pretty great good lobster roll. Bite into Maine does one better and makes a pretty GREAT lobster roll. Well worth the price. I love both the Connecticut and picnic style and am always left wanting more. Someday I'll go in with my fat tax refund (Thank you Opportunity Maine Tax CRedit!) and buy TWO lobster rolls and just have a day. I suggest you do the same."
1860,"Best lobster roll I've ever eaten in my entire life! This is hands down the MOST AMAZING place I ate at in Portland. I am a huge fan of lobsters and we don't get a lot of fresh lobsters back in California. I love how there were so many options to choose from. My bread roll was practically vomiting lobster because they were so generous with the amount of lobster they stuffed in there. 

I had the Maine and Picnic lobster rolls. There were equally delicious. However, I will say I liked the picnic one more because I love coleslaw. The coleslaw is a nice contrast to the lobster because it gives it a little crunch. This is terrible but I went twice during my visit and ate two lobster rolls per visit... I was so stuffed after but totally worth it!! 

The hype is worth it. The freshness of the lobster rolls and abundance of lobster meat cannot be beat! Worth all $17.95! I would eat this every week if I lived there."
1861,"BEST. LOBSTER ROLLS. EVER!!!!
Owners were on site and super nice!

Can't wait to see them at Allagash year round!!"
1862,Flew into Portland and first stop after getting my rental car was this place. I am here for a week and am going to eat as much lobster as I can. This place did not disappoint and deserves the 5 star rating it holds. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and clam chowder. The bread was toasted perfectly and it had just the right balance of lobster and cheese. They don't skimp on the lobster. I will be back before I leave.
1863,"I tried the Curry Lobster Roll, lobster was fresh, the flavor was just right and not spicy at all.
I'll be back to try the other flavors too."
1864,"Excellent lobster rolls. This was my first
 visit and the lobster rolls were impressive. They have some tough competition in the area. My next visit I'm ordering the lobster grilled cheese. I ordered the Maine style roll with light mayo And fresh chive."
1865,I'm obsessed with this place! I'm so glad they opened a storefront since the food truck is seasonal. Every time I'm in town this place is a must. Best lobster I've had! I've had their lobster roll and lobster Mac n cheese grilled cheese and they're both devine. You can't go wrong!
1866,"Very generous serving for a lobster roll, delicious butter flavor, non-ideal location 

One thing that distinguishes Bite Into Maine from other lobster rolls is that  they have a number of lobster roll ""styles"" to choose from: Wasabi Mayo, Connecticut with Hot Butter (MUST ORDER), Maine Style with Mayonaise and Chives, etc. It's ~$18 for one roll so it's pricey, but it's lobster. And it's a good amount of lobster compared to your normal roll. 

I would suggest going to one of the Food Truck Locations because their Scarborough place is kind of out of the way and hard to find."
1867,"One of the best lobster rolls I've had! I asked the people working what their favorite roll was and I went with the apparent staff favorite - coleslaw with lobster meat on top, celery salt, and hot, melted butter drizzled on. Plus the buns were SO GOOD! I got a side of potato salad that was equally tasty - simple and creamy. Definitely will be eating here again! Taking it to go the roll and potato salad survived the drive just fine and were still beautiful looking (and tasty!) when I got back."
1868,"My friends and I stopped here for lobster rolls after seeing the good reviews. Hands down, the best lobster rolls we had on our trip to Portland. The roll is super buttery and crunchy, and the meat is extremely flavorful. We tried the Maine, Connecticut, and Chipotle. 

The Maine comes mixed in mayo and chives and the Connecticut comes with just butter. Both are absolutely terrific and you can't go wrong with either one of these choices. The Chipotle is has a little kick and is worth a try if you want to try a unique lobster roll. Curry and Wasabi sounded interesting too, but we didn't get a chance to order them.  

The lobster bisque is also amazing. $8 seems steep for a cup of soup, but if you haven't tried it, you must get it!!

They also have a truck location that operates in the Summer."
1869,"This is absolutely amazing. I do not regret what I got! I came from Rhode Island, so it was about 3hrs drive for me, but of course I didn't come here specially for this. Anyway, I searched for lobsters because that's one of Maine's specialty and I found a few lobsters places. One of the places was closed I was surprised, and so I found this shop. I thought coming in at about 630pm it will be crowded (it closes at 7) but it was. It's a tiny shop, very cute, and as soon as you get in, you get to order. 
This is like a Subway you know? 
I ordered the Lobster roll ($17.95) where I can choose one from 6 diff flavors. Of course I chose the most basic Maine Roll with jus mayo (and chili?) and I got the lobster bisque ($7.95) 

I definitely enjoyed both of them. Lobster roll jus comes with lobster meat with seasonings (such as mayo) and wrapped in a toasted slice of bread (with butter cause it tasted so good). Lobster bisque jus came with a creamy soup, and you add the lobster meat yourself when you're ready to eat it. Unfortunately I don't think the bisque is worth the price, unless you like soup a lot. I think the roll is good, but I would not pay for this price everytime. Maybe once in a while when I decided to splurge lol. I paid $31 (including tips) for my lobster meal. I am not sure if that's standard for a meal like that but it definitely isn't for me. 
Anyway I recommend this place, only if you're willing to pay for it and willing to eat it. It tasted fresh for me and I love it :)"
1870,"Believe the hype! This was certainly the freshest lobster roll we had while in Portland. We both chose CT style as I'm not a mayo fan. Perfect roll and very heavy on the lobster. Also, there were only a few people in front of us at 11:30 on a Saturday! We went in completely expecting a wait and we were very fortunate that it was no longer than 10 mins. Paired our rolls with a local root beer and sat in the shade while we enjoyed the lovely views."
1871,"The best lobster roll I've ever had!

I got picnic style, which has coleslaw,  celery salt, and extra melted butter. The counter person (Alyssa) told me it was the staff favorite,  although the traditional Maine version (with chive) is most popular with the customers. 

The traditional toasted hot dog roll was PACKED with succulent chunks of buttery lobster, underneath of which was a nice homemade coleslaw (light, if any, mayo). I had to eat some lobster with a fork before I could pick it up. Delicious!

I'll be back (or will look for the two food trucks)!"
1872,"$17.95 for a lobster roll (4.5 oz of lobster). There are six varieties to choose from: 
Maine - chive and Mayo
Connecticut - butter
Picnic - butter, celery salt, coleslaw
Curry - curry mayo
Wasabi - wasabi mayo
Chipotle - chipotle mayo

I don't even know how to rate lobster rolls. Coming from the West coast, all lobster rolls are good... This one comes on a buttered brioche-type bun that kind of reminds me of Texas toast with large, chunky, fresh lobster. We did the Picnic and the Maine. I liked the butter over the mayo, so found the Picnic one to be my favorite. My dream combo would be butter, celery salt, and chives. Think anyone would make an Alice roll?"
1873,"I'm from the ocean state, and it's safe to say I've had LOTS of lobster rolls in my lifetime. This place gave this RI girl the best lobster roll she has ever eaten in her entire life. Wish I ordered two!!"
1874,"Our first lobster roll visiting Portland, ME. Definitely wasn't regretful:

They apparently have a food truck for years that was successful and very very recently (several weeks ago) launched their very own clean cute small sit in restaurant. 

They were very nice. The location is a bit off the highway but totally worth it. Their varied lobster roll flavors were impressively delicious. It was very satisfying, meat and fresh. 

Happy!"
1875,"Omg. Chunks and chunks of meat!! 

I was driving up to Portland (near the Old Port area) from Boston for the weekend, and as a Chicagoan, I was more than determined to devastate as many crustaceans as possible during the trip (quality seafood is hard to come by in Mid-America). Well, this was our first stop - mind blown. It felt like we each had more than a pound of lobster meat (for $17). 

I had the simple Connecticut-style, while the bf went with the Maine-style. Both were very, very impressive. See photo"
1876,"Me and the Mrs. were looking for a restaurant we hadn't tried and thought the menu sounded appealing... we hit the mark! Really excellent Lobster Grilled Cheese and the Clam Chowder was very good as well. Enjoyed the staff too. 
One note, for seating there are two 4-seat tables and 4 or 5 stools at the window. So if you're looking for a ""dining experience"" this isn't the place. However, if you're just looking for great food and casual seating or food to-go, this IS the place! Prices are reasonable and we will most definitely be back!"
1877,"Amazing lobster rolls! Super fresh, perfectly seasoned depending on what kind you order. Would highly recommend: Maine style, Connecticut, and Picnic. Always filled to the brim with 4.5oz of fresh Maine lobster. Deceivingly filling!

Can't go wrong with their pressed sandwiches either! Tried the Sweet P and loved it, but also found myself eyeing the neighbors Triple B which seriously looked so good as well.

Make sure to order your sandwich with a cup of their clam chowder on the side. It is the perfect combination!

Love love love this local place, congrats on your brick and mortar. Loved the truck and love this new permanent spot even more!"
1878,Delicious! Tried the Maine and Picnic style lobster rolls. I loved the Picnic style and my boyfriend liked the classic Maine roll. Staff was friendly and the lobster was spilling out of the rolls. Highly recommend!
1879,"What's not to love! They have a variety of choices; so far,  I've tried  Maine, wasabi, chipotle and the picnic.  Each was very different but equally delightful, from the wasabi bite, to the smokiness of the wasabi or celery salt/slaw, the additions complement rather than mask the sweet tender taste of the lobster.  I would recommend all the rolls I've tried so far although, if forced to choose, I must admit the picnic is my favorite with the chipotle a surprise second. The only thing to do is stop on by and try them all for yourself!
So glad that they now have this Scarborough location!"
1880,Perfection.  Tons of fresh lobster...simple and done well.great service.  Clean and cute.  Fast service.
1881,This place never disappoints.  Came here for lunch and the lobster roll continues to be amazing.  Highly recommend this place due to the unique flavors options.  My go-to remains the Wasabi Roll.  Give this place a shot.
1882,"Same business as the food truck. Hands down, no question, the best lobster roll in the world. 

The new brick and mortar location itself isn't anything special. Just another door in a line of buildings adjacent to route 1. 

The lobster is always so fresh and clean and sweet... not to mention plentiful. I always get the picnic style with coleslaw and celery salt. They also have classic Maine with mayo and chives, Connecticut style with drawn butter, wasabi and curry. The picnic always has me coming back. 

$17 a lobster roll but WORTH IT!"
1883,"Great food, good service. A little pricey and could use more seating. Would definitely recommend going for lunch on a nice day and taking with you somewhere to eat outside."
1884,"Great taste of lobster rolls that come with multiple flavors. Not only the lobsters tasted awesome, but the rolls were well made. Love it!"
1885,"Cute, small, and a tasty place to get a bite. I was a little disappointed with the bread and thought it could have a bit more unique. The roll wasn't warm at all or toasted to have any crispy edges to contrast the cold lobster, but perhaps that is just my preference. I would return for another meal though,  both the bisque and the Connecticut style roll were good."
1886,"It should be noted that less than 24 hours after posting the below review, someone from the restaurant commented apologetically.  I'm appreciative that they reached out and am thus amending my review.  

It is definitely possible that this was an anomaly.  The message also let me know that they have a list of allergens in each menu item.  Perhaps best practice would be to ask for it prior to ordering!  

--------------------------


I strongly debated even posting a review.  I'm not a big fan of reviewing after one visit or giving bad reviews, but will never return.  After a conversation with my friend who has a child with a life threatening allergy, I decided to anyways.  

I have a minor allergy to tomatoes.  After eating a ""fancy"" grilled cheese from this restaurant, my face was swollen, I was covered in hives, and had allergy symptoms for days.  

I did ask if there were tomatoes or tomato products and received a rude eye roll and a no from the employee.  I don't expect a restaurant to make me special food nor to go out of their way to accommodate me.  I'm happy to order something else or politely not order.  I do expect them to know the ingredients and be able to communicate it with me.  

I'm sure this restaurant is great if you have no allergies and I've had a lobster roll from their other location and it was great.  However, if you have any hint of food allergies- I do NOT recommend.  Clearly, they either don't understand, don't care, or don't take them seriously."
1887,"After a week in Maine sampling lobster rolls, I have found my favorite! My husband and I had the wasabi and curry lobster rolls and were blown away by the flavor from Bite Into Maine."
1888,Delicious lobster rolls. Chowder is good. Several different bottled root beers. Order at counter and seating is limited. Friendly service.
1889,Small little shop but fresh seafood 2 tables and counter seats fits a total of about 14 people. Service quick and lobster rolls great. Get the Connecticut. We'll come back
1890,First time going to this restaurant and it was great. I enjoy simple sit down and get your food places. The food was out quickly and was very fresh. Will return to for more.
1891,"I ate at least one lobster roll every single day I was roadtripping in New England this summer (sooo at least 15 lobster rolls in a row) and Bite Into Maine was far and away the best one for the value. Absolutely delicious and fresh, generously filled, and a really fun concept... all for a genuinely reasonable price. This roll was probably $10 cheaper than any of the others I had and even tastier. The Lobster BLT was also freaking delicious, as were the sides! Highly recommended, even if you have to drive out of your way."
1892,"Lobster sure has come a long way.  From being deemed only suitable as fish bait and fertilizer to now being the prized product and sole focus of establishments like the Bite Into Maine.  Apparently lobster was an ""acquired taste"" only until recent history.  Well, that is not the story here folks.  One bite into any single one of their sandwiches and you are taking yourself down a blissful adventure full of perfectly cooked succulent lobster paired with a perfectly chosen toasted roll.  The options for lobster rolls vary in style from curry to picnic, and after trying most of them, I can tell you that you can't go wrong.  My personal favorite is the Picnic style lobster roll, which is the lobster served over their house-made cole slaw with butter and celery salt.  After trying many lobster rolls in my life, the differentiating factors of Bite's rolls are the lobster portions, the way that the lobster is cooked (not overcooked), the pairing with the roll, and the perfect execution of the mix-ins.  These rolls aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Have you seen the price of lobster recently?  I take all of my out-of-town friends and family here to experience the perfect execution of the traditional lobster roll.  

By the way, the location is a bit hard to find as it is off Route 1, so just trust your navigation and you will find it.  It's on the back side of the Dimitri's building."
1893,Best lobster roll I have ever had. Simply perfect. My husband and I are here from AZ and are returning in a few weeks and this will be our first stop.
1894,"We tried the Maine and Connecticut lobster rolls from the menu. Pretty big serving of quality lobster meat and simple seasoning/sauce. We really, really enjoyed the lobster rolls. I think if you've tried a lot of lobster rolls and seafood in general, you will quickly understand that these lobster rolls are very simple but incredibly flavorful and fresh. Don't hesitate to come here - the best lobster roll you've ever had awaits you!"
1895,We drove up from Providence and called ahead to order because we were running close to closing time. The owner was so accommodating and even let us stay and eat 20 minutes after closing. It was soooooo worth the drive.
1896,"Fresh, clean and delicious. A small eat-in area will seat a total of 12 people.   Friendly staff.  The quality of the food is first rate.  Reasonably priced for what is served up.  Don't pass this place up !"
1897,Tried to go to their location at the Allagash brewery only to find them sold out for the night. Not to be deterred went to the Fort Williams today and was very happy we did. Not only was the food excellent but the view was spectacular too!
1898,"Delicious! First time in Maine, had to get the best lobster roll, and this place had the best reviews. We came here and it didn't disappoint. Amazing lobster rolls and great potato salad. Can't wait to eat here again before we leave!"
1899,"What a super clean and friendly restaurant.  Menu with a variety of selections, but most of important the lobster roll.  Who comes to New England and not eat the lobster roll?  Food made to order and taste fabulous. Highly recommend."
1900,"I 100% trust the fellow yelpers reviews on this place! I have never been to the East Coast and I promised myself my first lobster roll will be in ME. After reading reviews of various places I put my faith in yelp reviews and went for it. Ordered 3 lobster rolls (Maine, Connecticut, and Picnic) lobster grilled cheese, and clam chowder. Everything was delicious! Although I slightly prefer the picnic over the other 2, they were absolutely everything I expected them to be!!! I highly recommend stopping by here year round or hitting up their food truck by the Portland Headlight Lighthouse when in season!"
1901,SO delicious! They now have gluten free buns for lobster rolls too which we really appreciated. It was so good. Seriously.
1902,"It was very good but expensive. we tried the original Lobster Roll which was $20 with tax per role, it was very good though! Awesome location and very nice people!"
1903,"We decided to skip the crowd and came here instead after reading their food truck reviews. There was no wait and the service was excellent! We ordered the Maine roll, the Picnic roll, a clam chowder, and a lobster grill cheese. Lobsters are incredibly fresh! We decided that the Maine roll is the best of them all, followed by the Pinic roll. Clam chowder is creamy and tasty. Lobster grill cheese is also good. Highly recommend!"
1904,Super fresh and delicious lobster rolls. Love the space - very neat. Staff are super friendly.
1905,"Well, we were in the area only three nights. Two of them we stopped here to pick up lobster salad sandwiches and chowder with cold slaw and took it back to our place to have a quiet dinner (with a glass of wine). 
The amount of lobster salad was great. I had the traditional without chives both times and my husband had first the traditional with chives and then the chipotle lobster salad. He liked both. 
The cold slaw was great.  First night we had the clam chowder and the next seafood chowder.  Both were wonderful.  
The second night I picked up the frequent visitor card and the lovely gal punched for both nights.  I will bring it back when we return.  And we will definitely return. 

Thanks!"
1906,"My wife got the Connecticut style and I got the Maine style. The best Lobster roll I have ever had! Service was just as good as the food. Super friendly staff, super delicious, fresh food!"
1907,Amazing lobster rolls with a variety of styles though the Maine style is classic.  Very unpretentious place and not the easiest to find but definitely a hidden gem.  Also enjoyed the clam chowder and lobster Mac and cheese.  I've been to Maine on vacation several times and this was one of the best lobster rolls I've had!
1908,"Stopped here on my way back from Portland. Yummy! Great lobster:bread ratio (i.e. each roll comes with a  generous amount of lobster meat). They had a bunch of interesting options, but for my first here I opted for the Maine. Meat was perfectly cooked. Had a tad too much mayo for my taste, but still delicious. The employees were super nice, which is always a plus."
1909,"They specialize in a variety of lobster rolls, but I'm sure everything here tastes good.  I had the picnic lobster roll which has a sweet coleslaw at the bottom with a large amount of chilled lobster(no mayo or mixins), celery salt, and warm butter to drizzle over the top.  I used the butter to dip the top layer of lobster into and then drizzled.  It was a refreshing taste on what a lobster roll should be and reasonably priced.  I will come back here next time I'm in town.  The clam chowder was delicious too!"
1910,The picnic lobster roll is one of the best seafood experiences of my life.  Definitely the best lobster roll I've ever eaten.  Living so far away from the makers of this lobster roll is a bit of a bitter pill.
1911,"We frequent their food truck at Fort Williams in the summer and consider their lobster rolls the best we have had-favorite is the Connecticut style. So nice to be able to stop by in the winter and get the same great food (minus the great ocean view unfortunately). The restaurant is small and cute, 2 tables that seat 4, and 5 stools at a window bar. They also sell BIM branded T-shirts, sweatshirts and hats."
1912,So happy they opened this location! Friendly service. Still the same awesome lobster rolls as the truck. Lobsters are never frozen. Always fresh!
1913,"Men, I've experienced better (as Yelp describes two stars)....Yes I have at Bite into Maine at Ft. Williams!!!  And since I've had every kind of lobster roll they make (at Ft. Williams, happily swatting away bees,petting dogs. squinting in the hot sun), i decided to try their lobster bisque and potato salad.  My partner had the lobster grilled cheese.  So disappointing!  The bisque was an orange 'broth' with some small pieces of lobster meat in it...a little tough and nothing more....not even a sprig of parsley to give it some color.  It was tasteless.  The potato salad was over dressed with some mix of mayo and who knows what else, all white but for some pieces of red potato skins.  The pieces were very unevenly cut and sadly, this side was also tasteless.  The sandwich was like a jr. high cafeteria sandwich, but for the lobster meat, which my partner said was kind of tough and WAY too much cheese.  So, head over to Ft. Williams and get a lobster roll.  You won't be disappointed.  I'd skip this Scarborough location."
1914,Late lunch...had the Picnic Lobster Roll made with slaw and celery salt...EXCELLENT!!! Service was just as good!  Highly recommend!!!
1915,"it's okay. We are locals so decided to give the lobster roll a try. Had heard so much about their roll. It was good, claw and tail meat. Could have had a bit more on the bun but, who doesn't say that?! The pictures show more. Fast service. Friendly. A bit pricey. Good but not worth the hype it's getting. Still, we'll probably return if we need a quick to-go lobster roll, and who doesn't, but it won't be our first choice."
1916,Tasty lobster BLT and potato salad. Also: generous 4.5 ounce lobster meat on perfectly toasted bun. Located directly off busy Route 1 in hidden little spot. Clean and tidy.
1917,This was absolutely the best- hands down- lobster roll that I have eaten in a very long time! And it was gluten free! I had mine Connecticut style with butter- yum! It may be a bit pricey but well worth it! The bun is stuffed with lobster- they do not skimp at all . Highly recommend this!
1918,"Omg hands down the best lobster roll I've ever had! Made fresh, with fun inventive flavors. Fresh warm butter, chives, coleslaw, or curry. There's something for every palate! You will not regret stopping in for a quick bite!!! So much deliciousness I wish I had gotten a second!!!!"
1919,"Thank goodness they opened a year round location. Just as good and just as fresh as the cart by the light house in the summer, but without the long lines and the wait. Delicious and wish we lived closer."
1920,One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had! I've only had the Maine style but it's so good I can never bring myself to try something new. I was so excited to visit their brick and mortar store after visiting the food truck at least 5 times this summer.
1921,Hard to find but worth the treasure hunt. Plenty of fresh lobster on the roll. Seemed a touch pricey. Worth the trip
1922,Best Lobster Roll (I had the Picnic version) and Clam Chowder I have ever had. Only 13 seats for eating in but well worth it if you have to wait. Staff is super friendly. Food was served in a timely manner. Prices fair for portions and quality. This place should be packed every day/evening.
1923,Loved both Maine Style with mayo and chives and Connecticut with butter. Best lobster roll. Not much room to sit so I took it to go. They put the butter in a separate container and it was perfect.
1924,Outstanding fresh lobster rolls and sandwiches. Tiny place. No frills. Clean. Friendly. The BEST.
1925,"my only complaint: 

no lobster roll will ever be as good, or as fresh, or as beautiful as the ones from bite into maine. truly, they have ruined me for all other lobster rolls."
1926,"Driving up from Massachusetts, it was a very rainy fall day, but we just had to stop at Bite into Maine for our first lobster roll.  Turns out it was the best lobster roll of our entire trip.

Bite into Maine is a small little food trailer in the parking lot at the Cape Elizabeth lighthouse.  We parked, walked through the rain and stood in the rain to order and it was well worth it.  We ordered the Chipotle roll which was filled with lobster and filled the tender soft roll.  The Chipotle sauce had a bit of spice to it, but not overpowering, it was juicy, flavorful and overflowing with tender lobster.  I ordered the picnic roll, again mounds of lobster filled the soft roll with crunchy slaw on the bottom.

You must go!"
1927,"oh my gosh. THIS.
THIS IS WHY I CAME TO MAINE. 
the epitome of lobster rolls. 

I got the Picnic style (mayo, chives). they give a hefty amount of lobster meat that tastes FRESH and the bread is also perfectly toasted. I gobbled that up too quickly. so goooooood. 
Also great with bluberry soda. 
The Clam chowder is also very delicious.

Then my friend and I said YOMO (you only Maine once) so I got a smaller lobster roll, this time CT style (just nice hot butter). omgosh. dayum. so goooooooooooood. 
No regrets. 

If you are going to go see the lighthouse, EAT HERE. 
If you are not going to go see the lighthouse, EAT HERE. Then you can go see the lighthouse for dessert."
1928,"I had what felt like a quintessential Maine experience here: relaxing outside on a sunny day, sitting at a picnic table by the water and seeing the waves crash against the rocks while seagulls circled around me, clutching a bottle of Maine Root blueberry soda in one hand (so delightfully good that I brought back four in my suitcase), and enjoying a delicious lobster roll with the other.

And what a phenomenal lobster roll it was. Deliciously fresh, juicy, lobster meat is piled high on perfectly buttered and toasted bread. No other fillings. No frills. Just buttery bread and lots of lobster. You can choose from classic varieties or jazz it up with some funky flavored mayo options.

My friend got the more classic Connecticut-style (warm butter) and Maine-style (mayo and chives) lobster rolls. I was sick of the standard options at this point, so I got curry mayo and chipotle mayo lobster rolls. The Connecticut style was certainly delicious, but I found myself loving the curry one the most. It had that light bit of spicy, punchy curry flavor without overpowering the lobster at all, but rather letting it shine.

These lobster rolls were so good that we actually saw a seagull swoop in and snatch a customer's freshly made roll for itself. What an asshole. Not that I can blame it.

Their ""potato salad"" is just cut up potatoes in an onion-y horseradish-tasting sauce. I'd skip that.

Bite Into Maine is just a bike ride away from the heart of Portland, so there's no excuse not to visit Cape Elizabeth for these amazing lobster rolls and the breathtaking view. Portland Head Light is here, so make it a twofer. There's a reason this food truck has 500+ reviews and five stars."
1929,"Wow! I had a feeling this place was going to be good based on the great reviews! Yes it was! I'm so glad we stopped.  I had the Maine Style roll and shared some
Clam chowder with my husband. We enjoyed the views of the coast and lighthouse while we ate. It was a lovely place and I'm already craving another lobster roll!  

The roll was $17.95 which seems to be about standard for Maine. It was my 4th roll I've eaten in Maine and it was my favorite for sure!  I could have eaten 3!"
1930,"We seeked this place out after hearing so many good things about it. They have a few locations but we ended up at the truck at Cape Elizabeth as we were visiting the sight & the lighthouse. 
The view is spectacular if you grab the food & go eat at one of the picnic tables facing the sea. 
The staff was so nice & polite. We took the Maine style roll & the CT style roll (with glutenfree bread omg i was so happy) We were not disappointed. WOW! The lobster meat was so fresh. The bread was soft & slightly crispy and perfectly buttered. I really enjoyed the CT style one as it was simply butter and lobster meat so you can really tastethe lobster itself.
I definitely recommend!!!!"
1931,"We decided to checkout the lighthouse but as we got there we were pretty hungry and ready for lunch, we decided to just see the lighthouse first then go eat. However as we get out of the car we are greeted by the scent of something delicious! Lucky for us this little food truck was waiting for us right here at the lighthouse.

Best sandwiches we've had in Maine. Actually probably the best food we've had in Maine period. We had the BLT lobster roll and the caprese sandwich. Both exceeded my expectations.

The staff was friendly, the sandwiches were delicious and the view was spectacular. What more can I say."
1932,"Visited Bite Into Maine over the summer. I kept hearing that I needed to try a lobster roll and this food truck was one of the best. My friend and I were planning to visit the lighthouse anyways and stopped by for a quick lunch before continuing our tour of lighthouses. We got there right when it opened and there were already people waiting to order. The lobster roll was so fresh and savory. We walked over to some picnic tables and the view was a beautiful accompaniment to the meal. 

Tip - get there right when it opens. Even though we were one of the firsts to order a line started to form."
1933,"My +1 and I went through the northeast mainly to eat all the lobster rolls we could, and THIS WAS OUR FAVORITE ROLL. 

We just remember being so sad after we finished the roll cause we knew it was over. We weren't even hungry when we ate the roll!

We got the Maine style roll with the mayo and chives, and it was absolutely perfect. The lobster was chunky, fresh, perfectly cooked. There was a hint of acidic, tangy balance that made it taste even more refreshing.  

Pair it with a delicious blueberry soda, and enjoy along the peaceful green lawn with the ocean views and breeze - it makes for a perfect Maine summer day."
1934,"After looking at the positive yelp reviews and getting personal recommendations from friends, I knew I had to try Bite Into Maine. I got the Maine and Connecticut Style lobster rolls and boy oh boy were these, hands down, the best lobster roll I've ever eaten! Being able to try the mouthwatering lobster rolls was well worth the 5+ hour drive from NYC. It was super fresh and so delicious. The rolls were soft and toasty, and the condiments added just the right amount zing that complimented the juicy lobster meat. i will most definitely come back here whenever I revisit Maine. Give this a bite and I guarantee that you'll want more!"
1935,"I opted for Connecticut style (simple but delicious) I've tried quite a few different places while visiting Portland and honestly this is the best lobster roll I have ever had in my life! They're right by the Portland head light, not sure if they're there all year round given that it's a food truck. But seriously if I lived around there I would probably track them down everyday (I went twice during my 2 day visit). They really pile on the lobster!"
1936,"We got the Maine style and the chipotle mayo rolls and they were both amazing. I preferred the Maine style one because I could taste more of the lobster (less sauce) but the chipotle roll was almost equally as amazing. You can't really go wrong with either and can easily say that they were some of the best lobster rolls I've had. The bun was perfectly buttered and they really don't skimp on the amount of lobster they put on each roll. I am so happy we tried this cart after walking around Cape Elizabeth! I definitely would have wanted to order another one, but we wanted to continue trying different foods and didn't want to take up all our stomach space at one location. 

We did end up getting a whoopie pie to go because why not and actually ended up loving it as well! So much that we ended up making another stop at a different bakery to get another whoopie pie.

I would definitely recommend this cart to anyone in the Cape Elizabeth area. Note that they don't have their soups/chowders at this location though!"
1937,"HOT TAKE: Best Lobster Roll I have ever had. 

This is a little outside of Old Port, but it is so worth it. I don't know how this food truck does it, but the lobster rolls were amazing. It's at the top of the hill, next to a huge parking lot, AND there are benches for you to sit or plenty of grass to lay out and enjoy the sun. 

After reading all the reviews, I had high expectations, and it definitely did not disappoint. They have 4 or 5 different kinds of Lobster Rolls, but I stuck with the traditional Maine-style. It's so good, I wanted to set the picture I posted as my phone background.

They give you a generous amount of lobster, big chunks too, and sprinkle some chopped chives and mayo and DAYUMMM. My friends also tried the one with hot butter (which they pour right out of a teapot), and the curry mayo. All of them were amazing, and honestly, this is a must-go for me now whenever I go to Maine. 

I would even consider driving 2 hours just to go here again before summer ends..."
1938,"Don't underestimate this small lobstah truck--they serve a seriously good roll. 

Our group came in the evening and ordered the Maine roll, curry roll, and wasabi roll. I had the Maine roll, and it was lobster roll perfection. The roll was buttery and crisp, the lobster was perfectly cooked + seasoned, and it was a satisfying treat. My only regret is that I wish I got another roll, but at $19.99 a pop it's a bit pricey (but reasonable because it's lobster). 

There are lovely picnic tables and views where you can sit and eat. It does get a bit windy but it's a great atmosphere to eat and enjoy the park. 

I'd definitely recommend trying Bite Into Maine for a taste of the state and a delicious lobster roll!"
1939,"Came by to check out the lights house and a friend actually recommended Bite Into Maine.  Definitely did not disappoint!  Me and my friend were stuff from our other food adventures before the drive to here, but we had to try and see what the rave was about.  Already a line as soon as we arrived, but so many happy faces haha.  

Waited in line, ordered or rolls, sat down, listened to the many other people ordering, and began to eat haha.  So stuffed!  The roll itself was soft and fluffy and was packed with fresh lobster.  

On top of how delicious the roll was, the staff themselves were truly amazing.  Even had small conversations with their customers.  Pretty cool!!!!

Definitely would come back!"
1940,"First Stop on my Lobster Fest Day Trip in Portland! My friend and I took the Uber all the way out to Bite Into Maine right after arrival flight. It was such a beautiful day. And beautiful location right by the famous lighthouse!

We got 2 different rolls. The classic and chipotle. I love that it's not too much mayo and just the perfect sprinkle of chives! The chipotle was also super good with a buttery spicy kick!

All lobster rolls are about the same price so it's indifferent to me that it's 'expensive' idk but that's just me.

Perfect for that Instagram post!"
1941,"I took a self-created lobster tour through southern Maine and Bite into Maine was BY FAR the best spot. My wife and I ordered the Maine lobster and it was simply delicious. Full of perfectly cooked, fresh lobster with lightly toasted and buttered bread. Some friends ordered the Picnic roll which wasn't quite as good... felt like a little less lobster and mayonnaise because it was replaced with greens. 

Anyways, this review doesn't need to be any longer for you to understand this is the bet lobster roll you'll find in southern Maine. Pair it with a crisp ginger brew to create the perfect lunch by the light house."
1942,"During my last trip to Maine, my husband and I endeavored to eat as many lobster rolls as we could. Bite into Maine was our favorite lobster roll out of the four different restaurants we sampled (all located in southern Maine). We split the classic Maine-style and it did not disappoint. The meat was cooked nicely and mixed with ample amounts of mayonnaise. The chives on top were a nice touch.

I had some of the clam chowder and would highly recommend this as well. My husband also ordered a grilled cheese and loved it. (""They know how to butter and toast bread really well!)  

I will add that some people in our group had the Picnic and had sandwich envy when they saw ours... I'm really glad we went with the classic!"
1943,"I don't think there's anything else I can say to convince you to come here. Look at the lobster roll. Look at that view! And they have Moxie, for those of you visitors who have never heard of it before (I hadn't and it's weird). This experience completely fulfilled my idea of what ""Maine"" is: having a lobster roll picnic in sunny, breezy weather, with the sights and sounds of the ocean below, complete with a lighthouse visible in the background.

This was 1 of 2 lobster rolls I had during my visit. My friend and I both thought that this one was better, edging out the other by a little. Although maybe we were just won over by the setting :P"
1944,"The hype is for a great reason.  If you are a tourist coming into Portland, this is a must.  $17 ain't cheap, but all that beautiful lobster isn't going to be cheap.  Some places in town may sell a lobster roll for as cheap as 12-15 bucks, but they will be skimpy.

Grab a roll, take a look at the view and just chill.  The ginger soda is pretty great as well."
1945,Omg this place is freaking amazing!!!! Had to wait in line for a while but so worth it! I ordered the Maine style Lobster and the Maine Root blueberry soda. Wow just wow. The lobster was so fresh and the bun... perfect crunch to softness ratio. I could eat here everyday. I was a little disappointed that they ran out of the clam chowder. Really wanted to try that. I went to their Fort Williams location so the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. If you are in the area this stop is an absolute must!
1946,"Bite Into Maine apparently serves the best lobster rolls around, though I can't comment because I don't eat lobster. I can say, however, that the grilled cheese was a delicious treat after taking my weekly walk around the stunning park of Fort Williams. 

Tourists and locals: Come here. Don't be daunted by the long line, the food was made in under five minutes. You won't regret enjoying classic Maine food and views of the lighthouse, fall foliage, waves crashing onto the rocky coast, and sailboats lazily floating by. 

It's really hard to mess up a grilled cheese. This one was simple, yet made perfectly. The white bread was soft textured, but had a perfect, golden brown crisp, coated with a layer of butter. Inside, the quality, mild cheddar cheese was plentiful and fully melted. My experience eating it ended all too soon, because it's not that big. That being said, it was $2.95!"
1947,"I visited one of Bite of Maine's food trucks years ago, at Fort Williams.  The lobster roll was amazing, and I was excited to try it again.  We visited the truck today at Fort Williams, and we ordered the CT style roll, grilled cheese, and a whoopie pie. The roll was delicious, and was filled with extremely fresh lobster, which melted in your mouth. The grilled cheese was also delicious- very cheesy and buttery. The whoopie pie had pumpkin cake and was decadent. The food was well worth the wait.  It's one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had!"
1948,While on vacation my husband and I ate A LOT of lobster rolls and this one was the unanimous winner! We chose the CT style which meant chilled lobster meat with warm melted butter - so good. We also had the blueberry soda and it was fantastic as well.
1949,"This food truck was parked by Head Light. It's a welcoming snack after walking in the hot sun for a few hours. They have a few picnic tables right by the food truck, and also some picnic tables in the shade closer to the waters that we opted for. There wasn't a line on a September weekday afternoon. We got our food quickly. We got the Maine style lobster roll with chives $19. The lobster was in smaller pieces than I would've preferred, and the sauce maybe overshadowed the lobster a bit. The lobster was fresh. The staff nicely divided the roll in half to share. Coast of Maine view and the company is what really makes the experience."
1950,"Yaaaaassssss. The second best lobster roll I have ever had. I got CT style and sugar daddy got picanica style, please. Both were absolutely delicious and we got to enjoy them with a beautiful view of Portland Head Light, once we found a nice secluded spot away from all other honk-- I mean...tourists. So fresh. So buttery. So delicious. 10/10 do recommend."
1951,"Believe the hype. 

We hit up Bite Into Maine on our last day in Portland on the way to the airport. Stopping into Allegash Brewery (itself a very fun experience), I truly thought I was lobstered out. We had been eating lobster all day everyday for about 3 days, and I was done. But I was hungry, and the only thing Bite Into Maine had was lobster rolls, lobster blt, and a grilled cheese. Another lobster roll it is then!

You can get the lobster roll prepared one of three ways - with mayo/lettuce, with warm butter, and with warm butter/cole slaw/celery salt. I opted for the latter. 

And thank goodness I gave it a shot. This roll is LEGIT. Somehow the lobster at this food truck tasted fresher than at some of the places down by the piers. The celery salt and cole slaw added a nice tang, and before I knew it, I had devoured the whole thing. It was a perfect end to the Portland vacation - and it was nice to know that I hadn't eaten so much lobster that I was actually tired of it. Rolls are large and absolutely packed with meat. 

Not sure if Allegash is their primary home or if they move around, but it's worth your time to find them."
1952,"Yum. We got the CT lobster roll and it was so good. I also tried the blueberry soda and that was also delicious. Small food truck located right by a lighthouse on fort Williams beach. Beautiful views and amazing food, I would defiantly recommend checking it out"
1953,"Indeed an excellent roll.  I had the picnic style which included cole slaw.  Good size, thin bun (which I prefer over others), and of course fresh.  A couple points to remember: 1) it's not by the side of the road or in town.  It's in a park on cape Elizabeth - popular place and therefore...2) lots of tourists.  You'll be waiting for that roll.  We waited about 30 minutes for two.  Still worth it and of course that view is killer."
1954,"We had spent a week in Maine and were leaving on October 15. So on this last day, we wanted one more good lobster roll. We had just left seeing the lighthouse at Fort Williams park. So back to Yelp we went! And where did Yelp send us for the 5 star lobster roll....back to the lighthouse and park to a food truck! We stood in the rain, in a line and ordered the very best lobster roll that we have ever had. There were several kinds from which to choose. I ordered the Connecticut roll which was with hot melted butter to pour over the roll that was overstuffed with lobster. My hubby ordered the Picnic style which includes layer of coleslaw, hot butter, and a dash of celery salt. $17.95 each...what a great price. Make sure you get your first and last lobster roll here when you visit this beautiful state of Maine, even if you have to eat in the car because of the rain, like we did."
1955,"After trying 5 different places with lobster rolls, this is by far the best place for lobster rolls in Maine. THE BEST! They have so many different lobster roll styles. My s/o and I went with Wasabi and Mayo and chives Lobster roll with blueberry ice cream for dessert and I gotta say, we were so in love with the taste of the fresh lobster with a right amount of mayo. The amount of mayo didn't take the fresh taste of the lobster. The butter roll was just right, toasted and buttery. I could eat 3 of these if I could because of how light and fresh the entire lobster roll was! 

The scenery was definitely a plus, you get to see the light house and enjoy lobster rolls while sitting outdoors. Did not disappoint truly! Would honestly come back to get this again!"
1956,"BEST LOBSTER ROLL. Came here to look at the lighthouse, got the chipotle lobster roll with a coke for the hot day. I was SO impressed by the quality and service. The people who were working there were so friendly and answered questions about the food. I heard some people asking about the different flow or they offered (one of them was Indian curry lobster roll). They also had other food, I've included a picture of the menu. The price was affordable, the bread was perfectly toasted and buttered and it was a good quantity of lobster meat as well. Very pleased with my experience, enjoy the food on of the tables located in the park. Sit in the shade, or sun and enjoy the views!"
1957,"Favorite lobster roll in Maine! 
My boyfriend and I have traveled the coast of Maine and this is definitely our favorite. 
We ordered the Maine lobster roll, the Connecticut lobster roll, and clam chowder. Despite being very busy, they got through the line quickly and we only waited a couple minutes for our food. 
The clam chowder portion was slightly small, but it was deliciously creamy, clammy, and flavorful! It was piping hot!
The Maine lobster roll was dressed lightly in mayo and topped with chives. It was good, but the chive texture and flavor were too much for the delicate lobster taste. We much preferred the Connecticut version, which is just topped with hot, melted butter. They actually pour hot melty butter from a little teapot right onto your roll! SO DELICIOUS. The lobster was meaty and sweet. The roll was soft and buttery. THE BEST."
1958,"Bite Into Maine has a fitting name. It was definitely a bite into Maine and the best lobster roll I ever had. Went with a few friends, we had the Maine classic and the chipotle lobster roll. I think the best choice was the classic Maine roll. 

If you're planning to get something to drink, I would highly recommend either the blueberry or ginger soda. Blueberry is definitely sweeter than the ginger, but the ginger has a strong ginger flavor. 

We were about to get their clam chowder, but it was already sold out by the time we got there. We were sad and disappointed but would definitely go back if I'm back at Maine."
1959,"This review has the benefit of having now been to several other lobster roll locations in and around Portland - Bite Into Maine is head-and-shoulders above the rest. 

On our first full day in Portland, we rolled into Fort Williams Park to see the lighthouse and spend some time in the glorious weather - Bite Into Maine is situated perfectly near the lighthouse and close to assorted benches to sit out and enjoy the weather. The rolls were amazing and the grilled cheese (for my daughter) was perfect (and cheap!). This is worth the wait and exceeds hype levels and reputation."
1960,"Who knew that one of the best lobster rolls to be had is from a food truck? Bite Into Maine is located at Cape Elizabeth, and it's great to be able to eat such a delicious meal with a beautiful surrounding view. The staff here are also very friendly!

The food here is absolutely delectable. There were 6 types of lobster rolls, but we chose the picnic style. It has layers of coleslaw, lobster, and butter. The bread is nicely toasted as well! I love the combination of this roll, and it's filled with really great lobster meat; it was flavorful and has that not-overly-chewy lobster texture. We also had the Maine blueberry soda, which is great if you like blueberries! 

All in all, an absolutely amazing lobster roll, probably one of the best that I've had. I'm intrigued by their other flavors such as curry, chipotle, and wasabi. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Portland, ME!"
1961,"This lobster roll was good enough for me to start yelp reviewing. I've never done a review in the past, nor do I even like lobster or seafood really, but this was delicious.

We hit the food truck at allagash brewery just outside Portland. Not a hint of ocean flavor on this roll, just pure chunky lobster meat. The bun was perfectly grilled as well.

Must try for anyone visiting Maine."
1962,"5/5 for the lobster roll 0/5 for the potato salad. Stick to the good stuff! 

The potato salad had wayyyy too much mayonnaise and I am just going to pretend it never happened and not let it drag this review down. 

This food truck is located right near the parking lots for Portland Head Lighthouse. The line went fast even on a hot summer afternoon in July & the food came out much quicker than expected. The only bummer is there is next to no seating near the truck. Your options are to find shade under a tree on the grassy area behind the truck or venture a ways to the picnic areas around the park. 

The girl who took my order suggested I try one of the unique rolls, specifically the wasabi roll which was her favorite. I am so glad I took her recommendation. The wasabi was a light buttery dressing and had a kick without being too overpowering. It complemented the fresh lobster perfectly. 

I wish I was around Portland longer to try the chipotle roll and the picnic roll!"
1963,"A great lobster roll is one of those things that seems so simple, but really is hard to get right. Too often the lobster has been frozen or over-cooked and ends up tough and flavorless or the bun is lackluster and overstuffed with lettuce.  Fortunately, Bite Into Maine is the opposite of that! 

Every bite of lobster was tender and sweet, while the bun was crunchy and buttery toasted heaven. They have a variety of choices; so far,  I've tried  Maine, wasabi, chipotle and the picnic.  Each was very different but equally delightful, from the wasabi bite, to the smokiness of the wasabi or celery salt/slaw, the additions complement rather than mask the sweet tender taste of the lobster.  I would recommend all the rolls I've tried so far although, if forced to choose, I must admit the picnic is my favorite with the chipotle a surprise second. The only thing to do is stop on by and try them all for yourself!"
1964,I like my lobster rolls plain without mayo and topped with warm butter. The Connecticut role fit the bill and I was surprised by the very generous portions of lobster and the perfectly toasted bun. It was fantastic and at a reasonable price.
1965,"I have had lobster rolls from all over the North East and these lobster rolls are by far the best I have ever had ! Comes with an incredible view as well !! Highly recommended !!! 
So delicious !!"
1966,Came here based on the stellar reviews and was not disappointed! I've got to sample several lobster rolls driving up the coast and this one was simply my favorite! 10/10 must try.
1967,"Delicious lobster rolls close to the light house. I've never seen so many different flavors of roll. We ordered. Had the picnic style (favorite), Maine style,  Chipotle style, and wasabi style. All of them were delicious. It's like they took a whole lobster to pack into the roll. It was the perfect bun to meat ratio with fantastic flavors. The people working there were great too. Recommended the picnic and we were glad we picked one up. They even warned us if the scavenging seagull that got a little close for comfort ""he will steal your food""."
1968,"I've eaten countless lobster rolls and this is by far, the BEST lobster roll I've eaten, let alone, eaten in Maine. The lobster is sweet, cooked perfectly and nestled in a well-buttered, perfectly toasted slice of brioche? texas toast?-- anyhow it is just f'n good. $17.95/roll which is a bit pricey but it is really worth every bite. Got mine Connecticut style (yay, more butter!) and savored it w/ the pretty waterfront view. I'll be dreaming about this til next time.

7/19/18: CT style lobster is still just as delish! Price remained the same. A beautiful tasting roll. Love the consistency. Lots of lobster too, you won't be disappointed!"
1969,"Holy crap, I have NEVER had a better lobster roll than this one! So fresh, buttery and delicious. The bread was so soft and fluffy. I would say this is the number one lobster roll in Maine. 

The girls working there were super friendly and wanted to hear all about where we were from and what we were doing in town. They make great food recommendations. 

We went with the classic lobster roll and were not disappointed! The view of the gorgeous lighthouse and ocean may have made the lobster roll taste all that much better. 

They also have beer, which is a great perk. We didn't have any, since we had our fair share for the day already but I liked to know we had the option!"
1970,"While I cannot speak to the lobster rolls, a number of locals told me THIS is the best lobster roll. I thought I had already tasted the best one in Portland, so I am curious as to how this stacks up.  I will for sure be visiting here next time to taste it. 

What I *did* try was a whoppie pie.  Actually two.  The traditional chocolate one for now and a pumpkin one for later.  Both were fresh and delicious.  

Super friendly service. 

This food truck sits at the picturesque Light House, Portland Head.  

Beautiful place.  Beautiful food.  What else is there, really?"
1971,"That was THE best lobster roll ever. What makes the best lobster roll? 1) fresh lobster meat and 2) the right roll. And the right roll is a buttered, toasted hot dog roll. Bite Into Maine does it right!

They have different styles of lobster rolls on the menu but you've got to go with CT. In my opinion, a lobster roll should have NO mayo. Lobster meat (when fresh) doesn't need any accouterments! Well, except butter which only enhances the delicious sweet meat. 

Grab a roll and find the picnic table across the way. You'll have the most beautiful view..."
1972,"Visited on Father's Day and got the Connecticut style lobster roll which is a lobster roll with hot drawn butter. I waited about 15 minutes to order and another 10 for food. I was expecting the roll to be somewhat warm but the butter must have cooled really quick. I also added salt and pepper as I thought the roll was bland. I'd return to try the other unique styles, but wouldn't go out of my way."
1973,"Such a tasty food truck! We went by recommendation of a friend when visiting Cape Elizabeth and so glad we did! I loved the lobster BLT sandwich, they also have the traditional Maine lobster roll (mayo + chives) or the Connecticut style with butter. The rolls themselves are delightfully toasted, and the bacon on my lobster BLT was nice and crisp. We also enjoyed some chips and ginger beer. Would definitely eat these again and recommend them to others - delicious lobster rolls!"
1974,"Decided to do a ""lobster roll"" tour of Maine and this was our last stop!

We ordered the Maine style lobster roll which is just mayo and chives (so simple yet so good). And my fiancé ordered the chipotle one, again so good.

Super impressed with the flavor and amount of lobster they give. So fresh and lunch with a view couldn't have gotten any better!"
1975,"Came here with a group of friends on our way back from Acadia. Loved the variety of rolls that we could choose from. I ordered the picnic style roll which was a hot butter roll with coleslaw and my fiance ordered the chipotle roll. They were both great and loaded with fresh lobster meat. We also got a blueberry soda which felt appropriate since we were in Maine. The food came out really quick!

The truck is located in a park by the sea which makes it a beautiful stop to observe the Maine scenery.  There are plenty of picnic tables for seating but it was cold when we got there and so we opted to eat in the car instead. The park is also a take in take out park so there are no trash cans so we had to walk back to the food truck to dispose of our trash. Overall highly recommend stopping by here!"
1976,"I got a CT style lobster roll when I was at Allagash Brewery. They give you three options but this one is the one served with warm butter. While the lobster roll was packed with meat for 17.95$ and it had just enough butter and the meat was tender, I was upset that the lobster meat itself was cold.
I got the CT style expecting warm lobster roll so when I tasted cold lobster with warm butter I was thrown off. It's mostly my fault for not asking or reading but I think it's important for those who order a CT style to know that the meat comes cold. It was good but deff different. A lot of people love this place. I thought it was great minus that!"
1977,"I am a huge fan of lobster but have never had a proper lobster roll.... until now (I am not from New England). I scoped this place out based on the excellent Yelp! reviews and was not disappointed. I enjoyed the CT style lobster roll that cost around $20 including tax. My partner had the Maine style lobster roll, which also was yummy. My lobster roll was so delicious that I later went back and purchased a second!!! The bun was toasted to perfection, topped with 4.5 ounces of lobster meat and drizzled with buttery goodness. What more could you ask for? Simple and decadent. 10/10 rec"
1978,"Got off the CAT. On our way back from Nova Scotia on our way out of Maine heading home to NY. Downtown Portland looks like a great spot for just about anything. Probably would have been satisfied stopping in any of the many offerings. 

Thank goodness we went the extra few miles to drive to Bite Into Maine. 

Line moved quickly and efficiently.  Staff was great. Food was better. Simple grilled cheese satisfied the none seafood fan. The wasabi was great. My daughter will never forgive me that I didn't share a piece with her. The picnic style solid. Traditional spot on. 

FYI they do not have the cheese sandwich with blueberry jam in the truck. 

Amazing views. Of the lighthouses and harbors."
1979,"Be prepared to wait in line! It'll be worth it, I promise. The views alone make the wait a non-issue. 

I got a blueberry soda, a bottle of water, and a Maine-style lobster roll. They DO take credit cards for anyone wondering, and my order was ready in less than 10 minutes. 

They have their own picnic tables but I decided to walk a bit with my roll and soda to find a nice place to sit in the grass and watch the water crash into the rocks under the Portland Head Light. There's no bad place to sit and eat. 

I'm not a lobster roll expert, but I've had several and this is definitely the best I've had yet. They also had awesome post cards for free at the counter, so I took one and mailed it to my buddy that's from Maine and always a little homesick (and who could blame him)!"
1980,"Wicked good. Kudos to Sara and Karl for making one of the best tasting lobster rolls you'll find in Maine or in the nation. It's been 6 years since they've opened their trailer near Portland light house and they're not slowing down anytime soon. 
Openings at Alagash Brewery, Fort Williams, you'll find many anxious and excited tourists waiting in line hoping that lobsters did not run out. 
First timers, just order the traditional Maine style lobster for about $20. You""l find good size chunks of lobster on a sweet butter roll. Perfection!

Now, how do I bring some back to California!"
1981,"Best lobster rolls in Maine! My boyfriend and I each got one and then after I ate it, I had to go back for another. 

Tried the Maine, Wasabi, and Picnic style. The Maine was definitely my favorite. Just a classic touch to lobster rolls. There was so much meat in each roll; they said its about 1.5 lbs of lobster, so about 4 oz. The wasabi was good for someone who likes wasabi! And then picnic style was very different. Never had celery salt so it was interesting to try with the cole slaw. 

Also, Maine ginger soda is great!

All the reviews noted that the lines gets long, but went on a Friday at 10:45am and there was no long. It was great :)"
1982,"We spent 4 days in Maine and tried many different places for lobster rolls. This was by far the absolute best. I wish i could go back in time and only eat the lobster rolls here! We had the picnic roll and the slaw and celery salt made tbis roll. The lobster had a fantastic sweet taste and the roll was overflowing. 

We also tried the lobster BLT and a grilled cheese for the kids."
1983,"Cant be better .
Best lobster roll in the states.
Went for the picnic style and the seafood chowder.
Perfect quantity if seafood and best quality.
Highly recommend taking out to cape elizabeth for sea breeze , view and lobster roll."
1984,"This place deserves 5 stars not only for the food but for the location/setting. It is breathtakingly beautiful with the lighthouse and the water in the background. It's like the most quintessentially Maine place you could ever imagine. I've never had such a picturesque lunch while eating something so perfect.

Came here for my birthday lunch and I couldn't decide between Maine style lobster roll or a Connecticut style so I said f*ck it and got both. Maine one was definitely better. It was the best traditional lobster roll I've had. No BS, just perfect lobster with minimal mayo and some chive on top. Just how it should be. CT style wasn't bad but the butter congealed on top of the cold lobster. I assumed it would be warm so it was a shock to have a hardened layer of cold butter sitting on it. Still delicious lobster, but if I went back I'd stick to Maine style only. 

Line was long and food took a while to come out but hey, how could you be mad when you're waiting somewhere so beautiful. If you are in Portland, you would seriously be a FOOL not to check this place out. You will not regret making the short drive over. It's stunning."
1985,"This lobstah roll, just wow! The press and the Yelp reviews don't lie, this place has it down. Was recommend here by some locals calling it the best lobster roll in Portland. 

It's a food truck in Fort Willams Park where the Portland Lighthouse is, making it the BEST spot to be. The perfect backdrop for you to have your lobster roll and the best views all in one. I liked that they had a spin on the rolls with different flavors... but when in Maine. I went Maine style, and it didn't let me down. It was the perfect amount of mayo, not too much, not too little. And that roll, wow that roll, it was so buttery and sooooo good!

The service was great too. Theres a few tables right by the truck and many benches and tables in other areas of the park and near the water. I came here on a perfect summer day, the park is free, parking was a breeze, and the views are literally what postcards are made of. And on this day I couldn't have asked for more perfect weather. I'm pretty sure this is what the state of Maine means when they say ""The Way Life Should Be""."
1986,"On a three day trip to Maine, I ate so much lobster that I discovered I have a mild shellfish allergy - and out of the many lobster rolls I tried, Bite Into Maine had the best ones.

I honestly would be sketched out by the phrase ""lobster roll food cart"" in most contexts, but Bite Into Maine blew my expectations out of the (nearby) water. The cart perches on a hill adjacent to a majestically scenic panorama of the Atlantic Ocean and the Cape Elizabeth Lighthouse. There was a pretty long line, but given the vicinity the wait was no biggie. 

Between me and two others, we got five lobster rolls, a few specialty sodas, and a whoopie pie. I got a blueberry soda, hoping to have Maine's two specialties in each hand for the meal (blueberry and lobster). The whoopie pie was prepackaged and nothing to call home about.

But the lobster rolls - DIVINE. We got three Maine-style and two CT-style, and each was piled with a heaping, generous pile of delicious lobster. Super fresh tasting and scrumptious! They're a little pricey, even as lobster rolls go, but the taste, locale, and quality more than make up for the wait and price.

Tldr; I can think of no better place to enjoy the Maine staple of lobster rolls than this scenic spot. Visit the lighthouse after or before your lunch!"
1987,"If you come to Maine, this is a MUST go to food truck with the best lobster roll. I ordered the Maine style and everything about it is to die for. They give a good amount of lobster compared to other rolls I've tried. I'll definitely be back!"
1988,"BEST LOBSTER ROLL ANYWHERE IN AND AROUND PORTLAND!

My lovely bride and I enjoy driving up to Portland for a few days a couple times every summer. We had driven past this food truck several times since we go to the Portland Head Light during every visit. During our latest stay in Portland last week we decided to grab a couple lobster rolls from Bite Into Maine and we were delighted that they were so good. I will say that I cannot think of a restaurant in Portland that we have not eaten a lobster roll at - some of them were pretty darn good but the lobster rolls at Bite Into Maine are the best we have had in the Portland area, period.

They have several varieties of lobster rolls but I had the Maine roll (lobster + mayo + chives) and my wife had the Connecticut version (melted butter). The lobster meat is so sweet and tender and is my new fave! My only (tiny) complaints are that I wish they put small bits of celery in the Maine roll instead of the chives they use and that they offer a ""large"" sized lobster roll. Just sayin'.

They also make grilled cheese sandwiches. I say this because during our first visit there a couple with a 8-9 year old boy were eating at our picnic table. The boy had a grilled cheese sandwich and his mom asked him how it was and he said ""It's the best grilled cheese ever!"" The mom looked a little PO'ed - I figure she makes him GC all the time and the kid never said they were awesome. 

The lobster rolls were so good during our first visit that the next day we went back for a late lunch and I ate two more. And damn skippy, they were just as good as the one I ate the day before!!

The only sides I remember them selling are small bags of Cape Cod potato chips. They also sell some sort of craft-y sodas (I cannot remember the name) and Poland Spring Water. I just looked at their menu online and see things like cole slaw, chowders and whoopie pies but I did not notice them on the menu during our two visits and don't remember anyone ordering them so I cannot comment on them.

The truck is clean and there are a couple picnic tables there to eat at. The tables are clean, too - unlike the ones at the Lobster Shack at Two Lights (not too far away) which look like the seagulls make hourly bombing runs on. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back and have already recommended BIM to several of our friends and family who travel to the Portland area.

Oh, and they have a restaurant nearby (Scarborough?) that we are planning to stop at during our next trip up north."
1989,"My favorite lobster roll in the Portland area. Better than Highroller in my opinion. If you're only going to eat 1 lobster roll in Maine, I would choose this one."
1990,"Everyone in ME should go here and try their lobster rolls. They are SOOO good. Large portion of lobster, super flavorful, buttery bun and so worth the wait. We tried the Connecticut and the Maine. Hard to choose what we liked better but maybe the CT just a little better. That one has just butter vs mayo on the ME. Stop here and wait in line, you won't be disappointed!"
1991,Probably the most amazing lobster roll on the planet! Ask for their secret menu roll - with drawn butter and grab a seat at their picnic table to enjoy a small slice of seafood heaven.
1992,"I avoid tourist traps. Cause well, I don't want to shell out the money. The people I was with shelled out the money, and we crushed 4 rolls. 2 Maine, 1 Connecticut And 1 wasabi.

The wasabi was a waste, to be honest. Literally just a dab of wasabi tossed with lobster. 
Stick with the Maine as it was the tastiest. The CT (I think that's the butter tossed one) the lobster was so cold, that the butter  solidified and was splatter ed in chunks on the roll- ick. 

Tried and true. The Maine. Mayo, chives, boom. All lobster, no filler (Lettuce). It is worth the price tag."
1993,"Came here on Labor Day. The line was long but it wasn't too hot out and it went quickly. The staff was fantastic and they even took down our drink orders as we waited and brought them out to us before getting up to order at the truck. The service was fast and the lobster roll was yummy. I got the Maine style lobster roll which I believe had mayo and chives. It was very generously filled. I would've liked if there was an option to make it spicy with a sauce on the side I could've added, but overall it was yummy and craving was satisfied. It was about $18 which seemed to be standard in the area. The views were beautiful with the water and lighthouse in the background and that was a great added bonus that you wouldn't get at another local shop."
1994,"BEST LOBSTER ROLL EVER! I'm super adamant that when in Maine you HAVE to come here. 

We were on a lobster roll search and overall tried 4 different popular places and Bite Into Maine is the best! Hands down. Look at their reviews! 5 stars all the way baby. 

Get everything. Try everything. There were 3 of us and we got 4 rolls. We got 2 Maine style, 1 Connecticut and 1 chipotle. For $18 a roll, the portion is generous. The Maine style is the best, slight mayo and a whole lotta lobster. The bun was toasted and complemented the lobster roll so well. 

We regretted not coming back before we left Portland. Don't be like us, get all your Bite Into Maine fixings. It's the best lobster roll, you can't compare it to any other place."
1995,"We were thrilled to have the opportunity to visit on this trip to Maine. They were closed for the season when we visited the Lighthouse a few years ago...

OH MAINE!
This was DEFINITELY the BEST Lobster Roll we've EVER had!!
Shockingly good!!
Exceeded our expectations for sure.
We had it Maine Style of course.
Everything was executed PERFECTLY!!
This CANNOT be missed on your next trip to Maine!!

We will be dreaming about this for a while..."
1996,"This was our favorite meal during a quick trip to Portland.  We visited the lighthouse and had hoped to go to Cousins' but it was closed.  During trip planning I saw reviews for Bite Into Maine but didn't think I would be able to convince my family.  Alas, we walked up, checked the menu and they were in! My husband raved about the Connecticut Roll and the Maine Roll was phenomenal as well.  The lobster was SO fresh and the bread was amazing.  So glad we found this gem!  The reasonably priced grilled cheese sandwiches were perfect for our boys.  

Visited: 10/20/2018"
1997,"This review is for the food truck located at the Allagash Brewery. This has to be the best lobster roll I have every had. It was the perfect lunch to have after going on an amazing tour. At this location, you have the choice of three different rolls. The Fresh Maine Style is a classic with a pile, PILE, of lobster on top with some light mayo and fresh chives. The next is the Connecticut Style with lobster and hot butter. This is a good option if you do not like mayo. The final is the Picnic Style which includes layer of coleslaw, a generous drizzling of hot butter, and a dash of celery salt. 

I tried out the Maine Style and the Picnic Style. The Maine Style was my favorite. 1) Its the best bang for your buck since it has the most lobster. They are very generous with the serving. 2) If your someone who is their to taste more lobster then roll and you like something simple, this is the route to go. The Picnic Style is a good option for the variety eater who likes a little crunch. You do not get as much lobster on this roll but it was good. Think of chicken salad but with lobster. 

This is a must lunch spot if you are at Allagash."
1998,I've heard all the hype about Maine lobsters and thought it was all exaggerations. OMG! Bite Into Maine has made a believer out of this California girl.  Had both the Maine and Connecticut style. I can't pick a favorite. My only disappointment was that they were out of chowder. The staff was super friendly and the beautiful scenery made it this one my favorite stops of my trip.
1999,"Hands down the Best lobster roll in town with gorgeous view!!!!!! The Connecticut style was my absolute favorite one... melted warm butter CAN'T GO WRONG  They also have delicious local sodas, the hubby had the root beer and I the blueberry soda. Just the right amount of sweetness and blueberry flavor! Definitely stop here while visiting the Portland Headlight"
2000,"Eat this truck lobster rolls before you die, tried another restaurant down in Cape Cod area and regretted it. We swore to never eat lobster rolls again unless they are from Bite Into Maine!!!"
2001,"During our walk around the area, my husband and I decided to try out these lobster rolls. We ordered the original LR with butter on top. We decided to split one cause we had dinner plans for later...glad we did due to the price $19! Plus it was so small, approx 5"" If we each had one that would of been a $40 lunch! But I most admit, it was so damn good! 

Prices....insane.
Taste....AMAZING!"
2002,"Any sort of lobster roll quest should include this place, if for no other reason than because of its location right at one of the most famous light houses in the country.
Unlike most other lobster shacks, they have options: traditional New England with mayo & chives vs Connecticut style with melted butter vs ...).
I found the one with mayo a bit ""slimy"" texturally, but very tasty."
2003,"The best lobster roll I've EVER had! I ordered the traditional Maine style but added a good splash of hot butter...OMG! The lobster was cooked perfectly, all large chunks, seasoned beautifully and the buttery potato roll just made the perfect combination and added a touch of that sweet potato flavor...I would drive all the way here again just for another one! This place does not disappoint!!!"
2004,"Hands down the best lobster rolls we have had on our 13 day trip through New England. The bun to meat ratio is perfect. The toasted bun is perfectly toasted so the butter doesn't make it soggy. The lobster is so fresh it doesn't have a fishy, briny, chemical, or overly salty flavor. In a word, Perfect! I had naked with butter and my hubby got the Chipotle (lightly dressed with Chipotle mayo didnt cover up the lobster flavor). Current price $18. Not heaping with meat like Reds in Wiscasset (bigger for $27 incl tax) but the quality is better and fresher. Others we went to are Karen's Hideaway, Red's Eats, Erika's Seafood, Shannon's Unshelled. This is a must go for lobster rolls if you only get one your whole trip. Just skip the blueberry soda (chemicalish aftertaste). FYI, even my seafood/lobster hating daughter said the rolls were tolerable so that's saying something too."
2005,"Bite Into Maine is a MUST if you are within driving distance of this location. This place is ridiculous! If you are looking for large chunks of lobster meat and a crispy buttery roll, drive to Cape Elizabeth and check out this food truck.  

They have multiple options of rolls. I went for the Connecticut Style (lobster meat tossed in butter). I also had a taste of the Picnic Style (lobster meat tossed in butter layered atop of crispy coleslaw). 

They have some tasty looking sides on the menu, but I did not try any. I was, however, very impressed by the soda options - you can't go wrong with the spicy ginger (it's got a kick) or blueberry.

The staff are both friendly and efficient.  Even on a cold, rainy day they were all smiles and eager to engage and offer recommendations. 

Along with amazing food, you can't get a better view. They have picnic tables positioned near the food truck in multiple places, so you can enjoy your tasty lunch (or dinner) and take in the beautiful Maine coastline or splendor of the lighthouse. Even in the rain it did not disappoint."
2006,"Loooves this lobster! Connecticut style, Maine style; you can't go wrong with these fine specimens. When you find the truck get in the line, it goes fast and it's worth it. Undoubtedly, one of the best rolls that's ever hit these buds."
2007,Best lobster roll HANDS DOWN. It was the freshest I've ever tasted. We got the Maine Style
2008,A perfect lobster roll in a perfect location.  Friendly service.  Popular for a reason.
2009,"Stopped by this cute little food truck while visiting the Portland head lights. Pretty simple menu with some sides, dessert and other options other than lobster roll. My whole family got the Connecticut style lobster roll which consisted of just warm butter and it was delicious!!!! The lobster meat was chilled (I thought it would be hot) but that was totally fine because it was sooo good! Will def com back!"
2010,"Another great lobster roll spot I tried in Fort Williams Park! They offer a few different variations of lobster: Maine Style, Connecticut Style, Picnic Style, and others. I opted for Maine Style with chives, my friend went with CT style served with butter. We both really liked our lobster rolls.

I also got a grilled cheese for my 2 year old and she loved it as well, and it was only $3!

I recommend getting there before Noon as the line was nonexistent when I got my food but was super long by Noon or 12:30. I also recommend taking the rolls up to the shaded picnic shelter where you can take in views of the ocean and headlight in the shade. 

Such a beautiful place to take it all in, and was a peak Maine experience!"
2011,"All the reviews are right on: great food, great service, great view. Connecticut style lobster (butter only) roll was chocked full of meat...it was fantastic. We also ordered a caprese sandwich with balsamic glaze which was also great. Topped the meal off with blueberry pop and cape style salt and vinegar kettle chips. I'm so glad we ate here!"
2012,"Best lobster roll in all of New England and I've had many lobster rolls! Came across Bite Into Maine last year when I was visiting the Portland Lighthouse. Because lobster rolls aren't the cheapest things in the world, my boyfriend and I decided to get only one - the original chives. But after finishing, we immediately bought another one and tried the wasabi mayo lobster roll - just can't resist! They're both SO GOOD. We went back again this summer and got the same two lobster rolls. The original chives is my favorite because I could taste how fresh the lobster was and the chive style respects the lobster, simple with lemon and chives. The wasabi mayo is amazing as well because the wasabi is a great kick. Hopefully I'll be back soon!! No other lobster roll worth the money."
2013,"So overrated. Only ate here because I went to see a lighthouse and the truck was here.

I was in a line waiting exactly 45 minutes before I got to order, still a few more minutes to actually get to eat.

Everybody's talking about how stuffed it is but I feel they didn't finish stuffing mine :-( it was tasty though I got Maine style.

Would I ever do this again, NO, sorry but it was not worthy. But if there is no line it is possible but I have to order two for myself, one definitely is not enough lobster meat.

It is located by Portland head lighthouse."
2014,"Growing up in New England I know a thing or two about a Lobstah Roll...
1. The bun should be buttered and toasted on a New England Style hot dog bun
2. Less is more... it's either light mayo or warm butter otherwise it's not an authentic New England experience

While Bite Into Maine does offer other variations of the lobster roll (full disclosure I've never tried any of them because I am a purist) they have mastered the classic Maine lobster roll.  The roll is stuffed with juicy chucks of lobster meat (after all that is what everyone is looking for in their roll) perfectly coated with just the right amount of mayonnaise and chives to garnish.  When you bite into the sandwich you get the nice soft crunch of the toasted bun followed by succulent pieces of lobster meat.  

While this food truck is just outside of Portland it is well worth the trip.  You can enjoy your New England experience by popping a squat at a near by picnic table and taking in the breathtaking views of the Fort Williams Lighthouse."
2015,Probably the best lobster roll I had on my visit to Maine. It's in a beautiful park with a view of what I think is one of the older lighthouses in Portland. I went Maine style (cold with mayo) and was not disappointed. I think the instagramability of this place really earns it the extra star.
2016,"This place is by far the best lobster roll you will ever have.... Period!! 
The roll is buttery and melts in your mouth. The lobster is fresh, and isn't too fishy. The taste is good and there is a large amount of lobster in every roll. Unlike other places, they fill the entire roll with lobster. The prices are reasonable and average for market priced lobster. 
We had lobster rolls in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and other places in Maine that are known for their lobster rolls. But they all fall short compared to this place and there is no coming close. After stopping here, we were very disappointed with other rolls after, and we knew the previous rolls were terrible in comparison. Many other lobster rolls used small buns/bread/rolls that had no flavor. Here the bread roll was big, soft, buttery, and slightly toasted. Other places had a small amount of lobster, barely enough to eat the bread with. This place had tons of lobster (1/3 lbs), and overflowed onto the tray. Other places used pieces of lettuce to fill the roll, this place did not use fillers. It's was jammed packed with lobster and one roll was very filling and delicious. The wasabi mayo was different but just as good. It gave a little spice and wasn't overbearing. Both rolls were hands down the best lobster rolls I've ever had. Simply amazing and worth the stop."
2017,"Absolutely delicious and jam-packed with lobster meat. They don't add fillers, just lobster! We got there just before 11, and there were already a few parties waiting by the truck. As soon as they opened, a line was formed, and it took a few minutes to get to the window. The staff were all very friendly. After we ordered, the rolls didn't take long to come out. We grabbed our tray and turned to see the line had gotten very long very quickly, but I think it keeps moving. They do a great job of getting orders out fast. It is totally worth it.

Great service, great location, amazing lobster rolls. Definitely lives up to the hype."
2018,"Located in fort Williams park in south Portland, Bite into Maine is a small food truck serving  one of the best lobster rolls in The area.

Unless you get their when they open up, be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes.

There are several versions of the lobster roll - curry, butter, mayo, picnic.    - we had the butter and mayo versions and they were fantastic. Big plump fresh pieces of lobster! 

We had a few in our group who were gluten free and they had gluten free bread!!

There are also a few options for vegetarians - grilled cheese and capreses sandwiches."
2019,"Now this is a lobster roll!!!

My Husband and I ate here while visiting the Portland Headlight.  After a really disappointing lobster roll experience in Old Port we were ready for an ultimate lobster roll experience and this place delivered!!!!  We each got the Maine style roll and I added a side of chipotle mayo (super yummy!)...WOW were they good!  Nice tender chunks of lobster claw meat seasoned to perfection.  Can't wait to get back to Portland to hit up this fine food truck again!!"
2020,"Definitely the best lobster roll that I've ever had. A very tasty grilled bun filled with lots and lots of lobster. I highly recommend Maine style, but don't be afraid to try any of the other rolls, they are all awesome. 
Line might be long, but it totally worth it. 
Grab a drink go sit at one of those picnic tables by the ocean and enjoy the best lobster roll every with the great ocean view."
2021,"Our 2nd lobster roll of the day and without a doubt, the better of the two. 

The Lobster was like nothing I've had before, the girls in the food truck were so friendly and you can't ask for a better view. 

This is definitely a stop when in the Portland area!"
2022,"WOW- they found the perfect place to put the food truck.
Probably the best lobster roll I have ever had, and the location just added to the overall amazing meal.

Just great place to visit- this one hits the mark from all angles.

PS : I give them extra credit not that they need it, but something I want to point out.
They keep there prices the same even though cost of lobster meat was up around the time we visited."
2023,"For about $18 their lobster rolls is fantastic! Sweet lobster meat on every bite on a perfectly toasted roll with a great view of the light house, nice see breeze, quick service. It isn't a bad day to me at all! Highly recommend this place"
2024,"Crazy good roll. One of the best I had on my Maine trip. Doesn't hurt that it overlooks a lighthouse and the beautiful Atlantic. My wife and I got the chipotle mayo roll and the regular roll with butter and mayo. 
So sad that it only takes four bites to polish off but it's all about how delicious the warm bun is and the amazing taste of the lobster they stuff it with. There are so many options in Portland for lobster rolls, but I have to say these rolls were stuffed with the most meat, and they also looked the prettiest. Pretty cool that you could just have a picnic at the park with these rolls and just look out at the beautiful scenery."
2025,"Best lobster I've ever had. Period. 

The lobster roll was off the charts. The lobster stew blew my mind.

The scallops were definitely overcooked and I coulda skipped them for sure. I nearly took a star off for that, but.... the effing lobster!!!"
2026,"So first time here my husband I are trying something new based on 5 star rating. The staff is friendly and helpful. The menu is simple and fried.
We ordered the haddock meal and shrimp meal as well as calamari and cup of clam chowder. Chowder was very good. Calamari came last be was the worst, with the calamari almost shredded and covered in batter. So much so could not taste the fish and had to stop eating since the breeding was filling me. The shrimp tasted frozen and again too much batter and ate a third of my meal. The haddock was wonderful.
The people we saw there are regulars. One man approached us to see if we were enjoying our meal. He raved about the onion rings."
2027,"This is a perfect hidaway for seafood with a neighborhood vibe.

1) The lobster roll. Get it. Enough said.

2) Maine Shrimp get it. Enough said. 

Pictures provided."
2028,"Saw a 5 star rating and read the reviews..said to wife let's check it out!!!

OMG!  AMAZING!!!   Perfect hole in the wall ( literally).  Had the combo platter!   

Delicious , huge portion!"
2029,"What a treat! A little outside of downtown Portland this shack has some of the tastiest seafood around. The fried clams were plump and warm and came in a generous portion. The lobster was cooked to perfection, sweet and delicate. The roll market price was $26 and absolutely worth the price. The staff were very friendly as well, and offered numerous condiments. I would absolutely return next time I am passing through Portland."
2030,"The five stars are for the absolutely fresh & amazing Fried Seafood! (No ambience here so get over it...) They make their coleslaw fresh from scratch every day and it is delicious! The Haddock, Scallops and Fried Clams we had were top notch fresh & flavorful!!! 
The staff was pleasant & accommodating. There are only three small tables inside, and two picnic tables outside right next to the busy road (which I always find hard to put my legs over), so we sat inside and chatted with the customers & the owner, who were informative & funny.
If you love seafood, this is the place to come! Takeout = NP"
2031,"OMG This tiny hole in a wall is beyond sensational.
Make sure to try the onion rings.
A solid winner- no ambiance but still try this restaurant."
2032,"The food here was insanely delicious. It's a hidden gem only about 15 mins from downtown Portland. Chef Mike was super hospitable and friendly.
We had lobster stew and clam chowder (OH MY GOD, could drink both broths up with a straw). They didn't skimp out on the lobster/crab meat.
Everything we had here was ridiculously fresh and tasty. Lobster roll, crab roll, fried clam strips, crab cakes, and the fries were perfect as well. We were all in heaven.
Trust that this will be one of the best seafood places you can try in Maine. I wish the very best to Mike and his restaurant!"
2033,I love fish burgers so this place was a good for me a week.     ago. I don't like col slaw so I am disappointed
2034,"As a displaced Yankee now living in Colorado, I always take advantage of my time back east to eat the food of my youth -- fried belly clams, fried scallops, clam chowdah, lobstah rolls. Miller Brothers delivered the goods. Super fresh fish, simply and perfectly prepared. Winning!"
2035,"I've been coming here for about 5yr while on my way to Bar Harbor. Still the best lobster roll and scallops in town with an upgraded the dining experience. Onion rings are the best I've had. Anywhere. Clam chowder is phenomenal. I could keep going, but its making me hungry again! Don't miss this place on your trip to Portland."
2036,"Awesome food!!! Had a hankering for fried clams and wanted to stay local. So thankfully we gave Miller Brothers a try. We split a pint of clams and a side of onion rings. I have been looking for the perfect onion rings and finally found them!!!!! The seasoning was excellent, they were big rings and the Sriracha dipping sauce finished them off perfectly. Can't wait to go back for more.  The clams were amazing and the house made tartar sauce was delish. We will be back again soon. Totally hit the spot. We want to try the haddock bites next time!"
2037,We came in for my aunt who wanted onion rings and fried scallops for her birthday. She was very satisfied. Absolutely loved her scallops and onion rings were delicious. Different than anything you'll get anywhere else. Reviews on clam chowder were torn but I loved it. Lots of herbs. People who didn't like it don't like herbs in chowder. We were very impressed with the interior. So fresh and clean. Owner was very friendly. Thank you Miller Brothers!
2038,"In town for business. A local friend recommended this place. Turns out they just got excellent review in local paper. I had small lobster roll - heaped with lobster, and cup of best clam chowder I've ever had. I'm from Rhode Island and live near San Francisco so that's saying a lot! 
Picture is halfway through meal - couldn't wait."
2039,"WOW!! This place is sooooo good! Mike was very friendly and helpful.We make a point of stopping here everytime we pass through Maine. I ordered the seared scallops and they were amazing, very large and flavorful. We will surely be back!"
2040,"Small restaurant, like really small, with an amazing variety of seafood. The chowder is by far one of my favorites. I'd say it's up there with Pike Place Chowder in Seattle (although that one has pork). The haddock is fresh and so delicious. 2e had the calamari and clams as well. Both very delicious. The breeding is not too heavy and cooked perfectly."
2041,"Do NOT miss this little seafood diner. I don't normally like a lot of seafood, so when my girlfriend and her family took me here I was a little skeptical. However, the food here is amazing! The lobster roll is not only the freshest and tastiest lobster roll, but it's a really great size. I had the fish sandwich and left super satisfied. Even the onion rings were amazing! They have perfected every dish on their menu to make sure that you're getting the best dish.

Not only was the food good, but the staff was so inviting! They clearly love what they do and are so happy talking and meeting everyone from all over the country.

The restaurant used to have another name, but rest assured the chef is still the same and he's still making fantastic food.

I really can't recommend this place enough, it really is a wonderful little place. I know we'll continue to go back here Everytime we are craving the vest seafood in New England."
2042,"Stopped in for a quick lunch while visiting Portland and I think I found my new favorite restaurant. Everything we tried today was super fresh and cooked to perfection. The star of the show was the seared scallops, which I can safely say were the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned, fresh, juicy and simply amazing. 
The clam chowder is great, not too creamy or thick. All the side dishes had the freshness and quality as the main dishes. Potato salad, onion rings, even the fries and roll were all awesome. 

To top the the whole experience off the owners are super nice. 

Thanks for the awesome lunch."
2043,"Great fried clams- the 1/2 pint was more than I could eat in a single sitting. Real clams, perfect batter and a delicious crunch. Great for take out - not so great for a sit down meal. The outside picnic tables were fine for a quick bite though - will go back!"
2044,"When in Maine you eat a lot of deep fried seafood so I tried a bunch of places. Miller Brothers was by far the best. A little hole on the side of a building, this establishment is easily missed. If you happen to get lucky and find it, try the onion rings. Fresh cut thick and battered with Panko. So much better than that frozen stuff. Also loved the clam chowder, haddock bites and fried clams. All very fresh and deep fried to perfection."
2045,"We came here a couple times last year when they first opened and enjoyed it very much, even got repeat customer perks of free dessert.  We decided to go tonight on a whim and had no idea they had been featured in local paper today.  I believe some changes have been made to batters and for the best.  Fish and chip and scallops were on our menu with onion rings and fries.  The seafood was delicious! Cooked to perfection and batter was very flavorful.  All sauces were fantastic.  Cole slaw was very good, tiny bit acidic for me but that's personal preference.  Macaroni salad was delicious.  Portions are very generous and had to leave a lone onion ring because I was full to capacity.  Atmosphere is nothing special.  Minimal seating.  But best scallops and seafood I have had yet this summer.  Don't miss this place!!"
2046,"We stopped by on a rainy day and were not disappointed. We got 2 lobster rolls and added a cup clam chowder for $4, and the clam dinner which came with fries. The lobster rolls had a very generous amount of lobster, and the clam chowder was creamy, full of clams and delicious. The fried clams were piled high and crispy without being over battered, as were the fries. Glad we came here."
2047,"My only regret is not getting the large lobster roll. Small-town ambiance, amazing food, 15 min from east Portland. I love this place, i love the amazingly fresh and flavorful food, I love that the employee (owner?) walked me to my car with my 3 year old because we parked on the street (they have a lot people!). I also love I was here years ago and forgot completely until I was walking up to the door- then I had a moment of holy crap, this is going to be amazing!!! It was. Thanks y'all."
2048,"This place continues the legacy of the Fisherman's Grill: same amazing food prepared by the same dedicated chef. 

The seafood they serve here is the best I've ever had, period, no qualifiers, no categories, just the best and that's it. Its freshness is what jumps out, and it's prepared in such a way that the pure flavor of the meat is all that's necessary, no extras are needed.

My go-to dish is the fish and chips, definitely enough for a very hungry person or two casually-eating people. The haddock is unbelievably good, fried just right, and insanely tender, falls apart on your fork tender. Like I said, it can be eaten just as it is, it's just that tasty. Even something as simple as a dash of lemon boosts it from great to amazing. 

Since this is my review, I'm giving this a paragraph on its own because with the revamp they got the fries perfect, something the previous iteration could have done better. They absolutely nailed it this time, crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside with just enough salt to be the ultimate partner to your fish. Really shows how they're focused on everything. Okay, fry detour over. 

The overall experience is like a tuned-up version of what came before. If there were a couple of rough edges on TFG, they've been sanded smooth without compromising what worked fine already. 

Basically, if you're a newcomer, this is the place to go. If you've been before, this is the place to return to. It is pure local Portland. Long live Miller Bros. Seafood!"
2049,"All around superb Maine food. With the sampler platter we tried a bit of everything on the menu and could call each item an instant favorite. Best seafood we've enjoyed all week in the State. 

Many side items lightly seasoned perfectly --onion rings, slaw and chowda are to die for great.   

Great owners and engaging clientele.  A definite return trip!"
2050,"First time in Maine. I'm a foodie and seafood lover. Used Yelp to locate a nice lunch spot in Portland area. came across this place. you would pass it if your not looking for it specifically. I loved it. it was quaint, very clean and met one of the Miller brothers. food cooked to order. i had the Haddock sandwich. excellent. a friend had the clam chowder awesome. another friend had the shrimp roll. all excellent!! highly recommend to not pass this great spot"
2051,The freshest fried clams I've ever eaten! So delicious and fried to perfection. The place is not fancy and it's a little tough to find but well worth the adventure.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.
2052,"After a slightly underwhelming lobster roll from a very popular, trendy restaurant the day prior, I was on the hunt for a classic lobster roll. I decided to try Miller Brothers since it was near our airbnb, and I'm so happy we did. This was some of the best seafood I've ever had in my life.

I had the exact lobster roll you dream of getting in Maine. Plus delicious clam chowder, some fried shrimp with lots of good dipping sauces and cole slaw. I loved every bite of my entire meal. I thought the prices were reasonable/on par with the quality. If I ever end up in Maine again this place will be my very first stop."
2053,"This lobster roll may be the best thing I have ever eaten. The Haddock was lightly battered and some of the best fish. Those onion rings were crazy good too. The next time I fly into Portland Maine, I am making Miller Brothers my first stop. The service was top notch too, I highly recommend this place."
2054,"My husband and I were visiting from NYC, we are staying at a Airbnb near by Miller Brothers Seafood.  We were only eating seafood while in Maine, cause why not?! Miller Brothers popped up on our yelp, I definitely wanted to try it! My husband for some reason only likes going to places with a ton of reviews. He's a bit of a food snob. I told him to give it a chance since it has 5 stars.  Miller Brothers Seafood definitely deserves 5 stars!!! Chef Mike helped us when we got there, super nice guy! We both got the special they had for the day, lobster roll and seared scallops, I also had a cup of clam chowder.  It was fantastic!!! My husband loved every bite! The small restaurant was very bright and clean which is always a huge plus. I loved the wall where the map is, such a cute idea. Service was great! If we are in Portland again, we will definitely be stopping by! Everyone needs to go eat at Miller Brothers Seafood!!! It's totally worth it!!!"
2055,We stumbled upon Miller Brothers on the way back from Acadia and are so glad we did! It's a hidden gem that serves up some great seafood. The clam chowder is killer and the MB seafood platter was delicious!
2056,"Food was delicious, we had a party of 4 + baby, ordered a ton of food; we had the scallops, fried shrimp, halibut sandwich, lobster stew, chicken tenders, lobster roll, fries and onion rings. Couldn't eat everything but wanted to! Very good food, the place was cute, clean."
2057,"Just needed to do an update and post this picture of haddock sandwich and onion rings. Why you ask, because it has to be the best haddock sandwich and onions I have ever had. This is my 4th trip to Miller Bros. Seafood in the last 2 weeks. Waiting to review because I keep forgetting to take pictures of the food. Finally remembered yesterday but was halfway through my meal again. So decided to review and will post photos next time. Their seared scallops are perfectly cooked with amazing onion rings. The haddock sandwich and clam chowder was perfect. Along with amazing food the place is new and clean. Great customer service and friendly atmosphere. Next up is the lobster roll or fried clams. Added perk is I can watch TV there while I have my lunch."
2058,"Thank you, YELPers for finding this place. We followed the reviews and decided to try it. We were NOT disappointed.
This is a small place, only 4 tops and it was empty when we arrived. The place was so empty, we asked to be sure we were in the right place and discovered this was the place. The gentleman who greeted us was the chef. His name was Chef Mike. He was also the waiter and, I suspect, the chief bottle washer.
There were 2 sizes of lobster rolls on the menu. He said they were the same size roll but different amounts of lobster. The meat of one lobster or two. We ordered the 2 lobster roll with an order of onion rings. We also ordered fried clams and a cup of clam chowder.
The food came in baskets and a paper cup.
It was stunning. The lobster roll was bursting with large succulent chunks of lobster, cooked to perfection. Tender and sweet. The onion ring portion was generous and very crispy. The onions could be cut with the teeth without pulling out or the coating crumbling away, the mark of a good ring.
The clams were full bellied and sweet in their crunchy coating. Light and totally delicious.
The clam chowder was dairy based and so exquisite with the taste of clams and sweet milk and or cream, maybe some leeks. PERIOD. No bacon, no potatoes, no heavy cream taste, no bull.
This was the best we had ever tasted.
Thru our meal we were able to have a great converstaion with Chef Mike.
This was one of our best meals ever.
You gotta go here."
2059,This is the best Clam Chowder we have had after traveling in the New England states for a week. We have had other great chowders but this is the best.  The onion rings are outstanding also. They are lightly battered (homemade) and very flavorful. Loved this place!  We wish we could have tried more.
2060,One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had- and I'm from Maine.  It was overflowing with perfectly plump juicy lobster that was perfectly chilled and lightly dressed. Obsessed. Highly recommend. The owner and the cook were also just incredibly nice. Already looking forward to the next time I get to go back.
2061,"My family had the lobster rolls and the fried haddock nuggets, and it was all delicious and very fresh. The employees were incredibly nice and we had a great conversation with them. Generous portions on the food. Highly recommended!"
2062,In the old fishermans grill location. New owners. New look. Very disappointed. Lobster roll was not even seasoned at all. Just had mayo squirted on top. Clams were decent but I miss the old vibe and their food was better.
2063,"Had the O rings, clam chowda and lobsta roll.  All three where perfectly prepared and cooked!  There is nothing fancy about this place aside from the food. But the food is sooooo good, who cares for fancy deco. The place is small. Neat and clean. This is definitely a repeat place. Good job Miller Brothers."
2064,"The old chef is back with new management. Best seafood spot in Portland again. Excellent haddock sandwich and fried clams. Everything made fresh to order. Skip eventide, reds, two lights etc and come here."
2065,"EXCELLENT. Clam chowder that actually has clams in it. Not like the cheap rip off places that load it with potato and 2 pieces of clam. Onion rings out of this world, Macaroni salad and cole slaw excellent. Lobster roll Delicious. I wanted to get scallops but they were out so I cannot speak of them. Great customer service by the owners. They were attentive, friendly and polite. We wanted to go to a place off the main drag and this was the place. While it is a VERY small place (only 3 tables) it is worth the trip to avoid the tourist traps of downtown."
2066,"It was our first trip to Maine and my daughter found this place on Yelp.  Because of the 5 star rating we decided to try it.  We wanted Lobster, while in Maine, so we order the Lobster Roll, Lobster Stew, Haddock fish and Fried Shrimp!  Chef Mike knew how to season the food to perfection!  I see why they have 5 star reviews!  Their prices are comparable and there is parking on the street and a small parking lot adjacent to the restaurant.  This is a quaint place and they interact with their customers which makes it very welcoming and relaxing.  The Lobster roll was very good...the Lobster Stew was great as well!  If we ever frequent the area again this will be a must!  Loved it all!!!!"
2067,We stopped on our way up to Boothbay and had the lunch combo of seared scallops and a lobster roll. It was delicious and fast and the staff was super friendly. We will surely be back.
2068,"Really friendly owners, good portions and very fresh seafood. I would recommend the seafood chowder, full of scallops and lobster. Also get the seared scallops, you won't regret it!"
2069,"Waiting all week to eat a lobster roll, and the Miller Brothers lobster rolls, and clams, were excellent!  Yum, Yum, YUM!"
2070,"This place is a great addition to Portland!  It's a no-frills hole in the wall that serves some really tasty seafood. There are just a few tables for dining so this feels more like a place for take out.  I came here with some out of town friends and we all enjoyed it.  I had a haddock sandwich that was really tasty and definitely better than those served at a lot of other places in town.  The french fries were great too.  My friends both had the chowder and found it to be delicious. My only complaints are the fried clams were gritty and the lobster roll is quite expensive, clocking in at over $20.  Next time I'm looking for a seafood fix I will definitely come back here!"
2071,Incredible lobster rolls and lobster stew. Very fresh and delicious. Clam chowder was also excellent according to Auntie JoAnna (81). Small place but I would come back again and again and again.
2072,"Simple food prepared extremely well. After a very long day of driving in search of fall foliage, I stumbled across this place on Yelp. It is a bit difficult to locate, tucked back a ways beside another building. It is small but outstanding. Our party of two shared clam chowder, a cold lobster roll and the Miller Bros Platter (a combo platter.) They were sold out of fried clams, so offered to double up on the seared scallops instead.  Wow. Everything was delicious, and there was so much food that we were unable to finish it all. I have never tasted such thick, rich, flavorful clam chowder. The lobster meat was so fresh and delicious. (I have decided I'm a cold roll fan, vs hot buttered.)  The combo platter was fantastic as well. The seared scallops were tasty, but the fried haddock and fried shrimp were out of this world.  Do yourself a favor and search out this hidden gem ASAP."
2073,"Don't be fooled by the modest exterior of this place, their food really exceeded my expectations! Everything was very fresh and they KNOW how to cook clams. I came here with my fiancé and his mother and they agreed that a lot of places have a hard time making sure the fried stuff doesn't end up being soggy. But seems like this place knew the trick to do it right :) They also didn't hold back on the amount of lobster they put in the lobster roll. It was delicious and extremely filling. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Portland."
2074,"Our family of five was driving from Boston to Bar Harbor and stopped here for a quick lunch. It was perfect. We sat outside and loved everything we had. Lobster roll, scallops, and onion rings are so so good. The outside is easy to miss and the inside is small, but totally worth stopping!!!"
2075,Great new spot!  Lobster rolls picked fresh on site!  Great staff and clean environment!  Highly recommend!  Did I mention the Onion Ring???  Get them!
2076,"A small group of us stopped in here for dinner on our way to a wedding in West Forks after a very long drive (we are from New Jersey), and couldn't be more thrilled with the food and service. My fiance and I shared a HUGE platter of fried clams, a lobster roll, and onion rings. Everything was absolutely delicious. We couldn't finish all of our food, so we happily boxed it up and snacked on it upon arrival at our destination. We had plenty to share, and it was met with gusto. I'd recommend Miller Brothers to anyone who loves seafood, and will gladly be back when I'm back in the area."
2077,"We had just visited the Longfellow home and needed a place to eat for a late lunch .  The breaded haddock was outstanding. Lightly breaded, fresh and delicious.  The clam chowder had big pieces of clam and potato and was delightful. The onion rings were also good. We got a lobster roll, which was ok but it was cold lobster and I typically like it hot."
2078,Best lobster roll I've had. Their clam chowder was delicious too. Owner gets the seafood fresh each day.
2079,"This is one of the best restaurants on the east coast
The oysters were the freshest I've ever tasted.
The lobster was the sweetest.
Martina our server was behind a doubt the nicest most professional server I've been lucky enough to experience"
2080,"Not sure how this place has only 3 stars.

Best happy hour deal I've ever stumbled upon. 3-6 everyday.  $0.75 shrimp and oysters. $5 beer and Prosecco. $5 apps.  Can't beat that!   Shrimp were some of the best I've ever had.  Cannot wait to go back"
2081,"Had an awesome happy hour at Boone's a week ago. Wouldn't have even considered them or walked in if it weren't for the sign they put out on the sidewalk that said $0.75 oysters. (I thought it couldn't get better than dollar oysters!) So after the Mailboat Tour, we went to Boone's and had a light and early dinner off of their happy hour menu. We sat at the bar because you have to sit at the bar for happy hour. Shrimp was also $0.75 each. We requested two orders of the mussels, which were $5 each. (All food and drinks were $5 except for the oysters and shrimp.) The mussels were fantastic and we loved the bread they came with. For our second order of the mussels, the bartender brought us extra bread because we had finished the bread so quickly. Also had calamari and a shrimp skewer, which did not stand out as much as the mussels and oysters did. The shrimp skewer was the only thing that was a little expensive because one skewer alone was $5. Still, a great happy hour spot in Portland.

2082,"This restaurant is where it's at! The service was awesome! Our waiter, Dave, was so personable and nice! He gave us some suggestions of places to hit after dinner. (Our of towners) 
The food was unbelievable ! I had a special off menu of stuff shrimp.  And their clam chowder is one of the best we have ever had! The vibe is quaint and cozy and right on the water!  Perfect locale for couples or a big group! We will be back!"
2083,"Boone's turned out to be sort of a disappointment in a city of wonderful restaurants.  We didn't have reservations on a Sunday night so stumbled in here on a recommendation from a tour guide.  The restaurant is situated on the water, but noise from nearby tug boats and motorcycles made our whole dinner quite noisy.  Our waiter was friendly and was working hard, but he seemed a stretched thin.  There was little to no energy in the place - I guess it is good if you are looking for a more quiet place for dinner.  I wouldn't classify it as romantic, but it might be good for business.

We tried a few seafood dishes here and I was pretty unimpressed.  The seafood newburg had a flavorful sauce and nice puff pastry, but very little seafood.  The scallops were well prepared and tasty, but again only 3 tiny pieces.  The kids cheeseburgers were way over cooked and served on soggy buns.  The whole meal just felt like a waste as we were surrounded by so many better seafood places in the area.  That explains why there was no line when we went while other establishments quoted us over an hour.

Nothing was very bad here, but for the price point I was expected a whole lot more in Maine!"
2084,"I am going to start this review by saying that the food QUALITY was amazing (hence the two stars), the QUANTITY not so much.  I was quite shocked when the $26 fried seafood platter, which was one of the less expensive options, arrived.  It contained exactly 2 fried shrimps, 4 fried scallops, 1 small piece of fried haddock, and a small handful of fried clams. The french fries took up the majority of the plate.  I would have liked more shrimp (TWO?? Really?) and scallops and some coleslaw for $26.  The waiter did not bring us dinner rolls, nor did he stop back to check on us (I had to flag him down twice when I needed ketchup and tarter sauce).  Like I said, the food was good, but the value was not...I would not return to this restaurant due to the high prices and scant portions."
2085,"This place has patio seating on both levels. If the bar downstairs is crowded, try heading to the second floor for more seating. I came here 3x in 5 days..that's how much I liked it. 

Day 1: lunch - got a Caesar salad with lobster. Simple and delicious. Also had their shrimp cocktail (came out on ice w/ my friend's oysters).  Be sure to  ask for extra cocktail sauce - one is never enough. 

Day 2 & 3: I couldn't resist their shrimp and had to get more. My friends also liked this spot so no arms were twisted for the making of these meals. We came for happy hour (beers and oysters.. shrimp is not included unfortunately - but I didn't care) and went to the second floor bar which was pretty empty (aka perfect for us). The bartender was so friendly and remembered us the next day (think Kaley Cuoco w/ Drew Barrymore's voice). We loved her!! The doors are open to the patio and you can get a nice breeze in and catch all the music that the Porthole is playing downstairs.  The inside bar kind of forms a weird loop with the outside bar and patio so it makes for an excellent front row seat to people watch. 

I would absolutely come back next time I'm in town. (Oh FYI - our friend is from Portland so this place has his stamp of approval!)"
2086,Very expensive and quality of food is not up to par. Watch out for drinks that you order then bartenders add liquor to up the price of drinks
2087,"People may call this a tourist trap.  But whats better than a view of the water, great service, and excellent lobster rolls.  Not much.  Perfect spot for lunch

Pros:  Scallops n bacon for an app was great.  Lobster rolls were great.  Clam chowder was very good.  Service was excellent.  Titos and soda was excellent.  The view was excellent.  

Cons: Nothing from what I saw.  I was very impressed.  

This is one of the places where you should not read too many of the reviews cause it is what it is.  Great food, great service and great food.  Perfect for lunch"
2088,"Happy hour from 3-6 is amazing.  75 cent chef choice oysters, spicy wings for five bucks and a super helpful Allison behind the bar.  For dinner I went for the lobster and scallop stuff haddock with side of asparagus.  Worth the healthy calories."
2089,"We came in here for a lunch,  this place is all about its location. The diners know it and so does the restaurant. It sits right on the water with a magnificent view of the harbor. 

The food itself is not bad, it's not great either. I ordered the tuna poke which was really poorly executed. The poke resembled a ceviche with a explosion of superfluous accoutrements that served no purpose other than to annoy the diner. The clam chowder was average, nothing to write home about.  Overall, there's better places in Portland to eat."
2090,"A friend that lives in Portland directed us here on our way through and it was fabulous! They are known for their baked stuffed lobster but it is $65! But...they had a 3 course $30 special. That included a half baked stuffed lobster with soup and dessert. My partner took that option. I chose the 12 oz sirloin with horseradish mashed potato and asparagus, a side salad and apple crisp. All that for$30 each. Delicious food, excellent service and a great price! Can't ask for more than that!"
2091,Horrible experience this evening. Ordered drinks took over 30 mins then requested to move tables because they put us in a dark corner. Waitress said she would move us. Gone again. The table that was available given to someone else. Waitress still gone. Food order not taken.... still sitting. Finally 45 mins later since we arrived moved tables and ordered food which at this point was told the kitchen was closing in 5 mins and eventually will get our food. So 30 mins later we got our food. The food was amazing! Manager came by to see how things were going..... explained. They were apologetic. So my rating was for service
2092,Lobster roll was meh and overpriced. 32 bucks to be exact. The tuna poke was on point and only 19. Sat outside which was nice. Beautiful day. Staff was friendly. Not sure if I would be back. Seems a bit like a tourist trap and way too pricey.
2093,"What a bummer on all fronts.  We were in town on vacation, and a local friend recommended Boone's for a nice meal out.  It was also my birthday, so we were excited to eat some great seafood downtown.  First off, the reservation process was a breeze online, and they had also noted and made mention of my birthday, a nice touch.  

After being seated we waited 12 minutes to be greeted.  I had to flag down a hostess to get us water and a server.  It's busy and in season, so I let it go.

We ordered chicken wings and calamari, and some oysters.  I inquired about how the wings  were prepared and was told they were gluten free and had no breading.  They were def coated in some sort of starch, corn starch perhaps or an alternative flour?  They were unremarkable in flavor, but not awful.  However, I didn't get to enjoy them, because of my fear in how they were prepped.  I've worked in enough kitchens to know that wasn't a bare wing.

Calamari was cooked well, portion was large, but the sauce was very sweet, not a great compliment to the dish.  The oysters were great, but $3.45/each is a little absurd.  For a local product, even in a vaca area, that just seemed excessive.  

After we were almost done with apps our server finally took our dinner order.  I was worried this would mean a long wait, but tried to be optimistic.  I'm not a fan of poorly timed meals.  I ordered hanger steak, and my husband got the nor'easter lobster roll.

Our mains took forrrrrrrever.  Again, busy in season night, but dude, easily like 30 minutes for entrees.  My steak looked amazing and was cooked to temp, but tasted so strongly of liver I sent it back.
My husband's lobster roll, to be blunt, was a hot ass mess.  For $32 he received a small portion of seriously over cooked lobster meat.  It didn't taste of butter as described, and the brioche bun was so sweet (like a Hawaiian roll) it imparted it's flavor onto the rubbery seafood.  

Just bad execution, we spent $100 to sit through too long of an experience I didn't even get to eat at.  I'm hungry, I'm crabby, and we will not be back."
2094,"The interior is flat out beautiful. Like an upscale Jameson's (Freeport). The food leaves a lot to be desired and is expensive. 

Their clam chowder isn't as dense and rich as standard NECLAM but the veggies are well prepared and served with a nice portion of seafood.

The haddock and scallops we tried were well prepared and moderately tasty but didn't scream with unique flavors or anything differentiated from a standard fish house.

3 fish entrees with a side, 2 cups of clam and 3 beers ran us nearly $150 for lunch.

Boone's is good, but unfortunately it falls to average when you compare it to all the other amazing seafood options that Portland has to offer."
2095,"Great place. The host was polite and dressed in a shirt and tie.  To the outside covered seating area I go.  Great swordfish best I have ever had.A couple of drinks ""painkillers""help the ease the pain of the impending check. Ashley our server was prompt and fun. Could not have asked for better. Thanks Ashley and company for making my first trip one that has me already wanting to plan my next one!"
2096,"Ive eaten here twice. The service is great. Food is ok. Not the most amazing flavors, but decent, fresh seafood."
2097,"Service: Friendly and Attentive
Food: Fresh 

Boone's was a great relief after having to leave Porthole next door, that had the some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Skip Porthole and come to outdoor patio on the second floor of Boone's.

Boone's had excellent and friendly service from the moment we stepped in. We ordered fresh oysters and had the lobster, which we devoured immediately. Their fresh beers on tap went well with our food and the atmosphere couldn't have been better on a warm sunny day on the patio."
2098,"Kudos to our waiter Nick! Outstanding service. If the seafood was any fresher it would be moving.

I could tell how fresh everything was.

Certainly coming back in my next vacation here."
2099,"Boone's is in a prime location overlooking the water. I would highly recommend making a reservation to get a nice view and sit on the rooftop. I ordered the seafood newburg and crispy brussel sprouts. My two friends also ordered the seafood newburg and our dishes came out on the cooler side which was not ideal for a $33 dish. Our waiter was extremely kind and apologized when he brought us our heated dishes. The dish said sherry cream sauce but there wasn't much acid to cut through the heaviness of the cream. The sauce lacked flavor as did the seafood. Also all threee newburgs has a different amount of sauce. Mine didn't have enough sauce to soak up the popover while my friend's was swimming in cream. The brussel sprouts were standard but not crispy and overly salty. 

A friend got the mac and cheese and for $10 it was a generous portion. Another friend got clams and they looked meaty and fresh. I'd come back for the mac and cheese and the view but not much else."
2100,"I am being generous by giving this place two stars, and it's really for the staff...not the food.

The staff were all really friendly and helpful. I must point this out because New England isn't exactly known for being welcoming to non-white people. 

The food was not as friendly to us at all. My mom had the fried clams. When she had to reach for the salt and pepper, we knew that there was a problem. My mom doesn't usually do this. I ordered the stuffed shrimp. If it had risen to the heights of ""mediocre"", I would have been happier. The shrimp were way overcooked and the ""stuffing"" was dry  and flavorless. The potatoes were severely unseasoned and even salt and pepper couldn't make them more enjoyable. My daughter had the chicken, which she also seasoned. My son ordered the salmon and broccolini. He didn't have to season his fish, but did season the broccolini. 

We all agreed that we should have taken the trip to Maine before we went to Beacon in New York. The Pandorica is so far above Boone's that the level of disappointment is still being felt.

One would think that a seafood restaurant on the ocean would do better. Alas, we'll choose elsewhere the next time we make the drive."
2101,"This place has some iffy reviews but we have been here twice now and loved it! The food is delicious however can be expensive. A lobster roll is over $30?! I got the scallop BLT and my husband got the Newburg. Both delicious and worth it. They have local beer options and a full bar for the non-beer lovers. Both a first and second floor deck. It seems like this is a great place for people watching The Porthole! If there is a wait, don't worry, you can explore the surrounding areas and they will call you when they are ready. You shouldn't plan on parking here. Find a nearby lot. Be ready for loud music if The Porthole has live music and you're on the deck.  They can accommodate larger parties which is also nice! Dogs allowed on the decks? We saw a few but unsure if they were service dogs or not."
2102,"Terrific restaurant.  Wonderful food, great, friendly service.
This is, hands down, the easiest and best place to book for a group.
Our business did our holiday lunch for 15 people there and had a great time-- the food and the service were both excellent.  We liked it so much that we booked a private cocktail party for twice the amount of people.  It was incredibly easy to arrange-- Anna and Darcy were both very helpful.
And the event was lovely, easy, with really good appetizers and cocktails.
Great spot, I highly recommend it."
2103,"This two star review is disappointing because the food was absolutely amazing. We ordered the lobster roll and the lobster Mac and cheese. HOWEVER, the server was insanely overwhelmed and made us feel very uncomfortable. We were almost forced out the door. I am so sad to say this because the food really was amazing but I would never go back because of the server. She was very very unprofessional. I am sure there are plenty other places in Portland to get lobster with a much better atmosphere!"
2104,"Snowy, Monday night and it was close to the hotel so I went back - my last visit over the summer was very disappointing: long wait time, mediocre food, so I was apprehensive. Having come here for over 20 years on and off, and never having a bad experience except last summer, I wasn't ready to write them off. Anybody can have a bad day. So glad I came back!! Field green salad with blackened scallops followed with baked, stuffed haddock- unbelievable!! Best ever and now back on my ""must eat here"" list!"
2105,Boone's has been outstanding every time I've been there!  It's one of the best restaurants in Portland.  Love dining there.  The seafood is always fresh.  I have never had a bad meal at Boone's.   What more can you ask for?  Outstanding!!
2106,"I had high hopes for this place as my brother and sister in law were big fans. We arrived around 4:30 for an early dinner, we were seated on the patio in a great spot. Our waitress Martina was excellent, she was attentive and knowledgeable. I was loving the vibes and our drinks but our food was pretty disappointing.

Everyone in our party who ordered lobster loved their meal, but I'm allergic and hubs doesn't like shellfish. He ordered the Hanger steak medium. It came out charred black with no pink inside. It was beautifully plated with tons of potato wedges. I ordered the pork belly fried rice. It came with TONS of food. Mostly over soy sauced/very salty rice with hardly any over-salted pork belly. I would not recommend. After my husband complained about the cook of his steak the waitress gave him a free beer. With 6 people our check was close to 400 dollars. I was not blown away but I feel like it must be my fault as I can't do shellfish."
2107,"Not great service and sub par food to match. Overpriced but at least there's nice views of the water. Would only recommended to sit on the patio, and grab a drink! 
Go to the upstairs bar, tables are not worth the wait."
2108,"Boone's is a good choice if you're looking for fresh seafood on the Portland docks. Obviously, Maine lobster is their specialty - specifically the stuffed lobster option. The MK value price was a bit high ($65) but when the beast of a meal arrived, the thought of the price went away. As stuffed lobsters go, it was on par with not much meat through except the tail and the claws. 

I ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts on the side and those were delicious. Having the dinner at the bar, the bartender did a great job of keeping my iced tea filled.

I would definitely go again but I may try the fresh fish or scallops options next time around."
2109,Pretty good lobster here at Boone's. The service was fantastic. I ordered the baked stuffed lobster and I had no complaints. Make sure you ask what the market price is before you en up paying $70 for a lobster.
2110,Everyone recommended Boone's and I'm so glad they did. Great happy hour scene and luckily we got to sit on the patio for dinner. My wife got the clam chowda and oysters along with the stuffed Haddock. Me being a non seafooder was a little worried but the pepper crusted steak was amazing. Can't recommend this place enough.
2111,Clam chowder and lobster roll are worst I have ever eaten. Don't wanna go this place again.
2112,Was on work travel and a coworker and I stopped for dinner one night. We had to try the lobster as it was our first time in Maine. It did not disappoint!!! The prices were pretty high though.
2113,We went here for their happy hour between 4-6p at the upstairs bar. The $1.50 oysters and $5 calamari were very good. Definitely worth checking out for a more budget friendly meal in Portland while still being great quality.
2114,"Very bad experience. We had the lobster mac & cheese, overpriced at $32 (in Jul 2018), oily, chewy, greasy, nothing special.
On top, the terrace is raided by the seagulls...

I'd suggest to go elsewhere, the view doesn't really worth that much.

Our sever was nice though, and all the staff is friendly."
2115,"Long story short: Great food, cool waiter, excellent location. 

Short story long: I got the lobster mac and cheese, my wife got the tuna poke bowl, and we shared the crab cakes and a sundae. The lobster Mac was super creamy and the lobster was fresh. My wife loved the poke bowl - the crab cakes were flavorful and crispy. If you're looking for a fun night with delicious food, all in a restaurant right on the water, this is the place to go!"
2116,"Great experience in this place and the service was the best of the best! The bear amazing and the Oysters just as promised.
Staff is very kind since the moment you arrive and the waitress (didn't get her name ) was so nice and took the time to explain the entire Menu and the different kinds of beer they had!  Totally recommend it!!!!"
2117,"$1 DOLLAR OYSTER HAPPY HOUR !!!!!!!!!


I'm a big fan of oysters but after going to an oyster happy hour the week before and spending too much money, we wanted to try Maine's options on a budget. Boone's kept showing up on the top of the list so we decided to check it out.

We arrived 15 minutes before the happy hour began, which btw is at the bar only. We were the first two people so were able to get our choice seat and wait for the happy hour time. We ended up ordering nachos and some drinks while we waited. However, all of these ended up being on the happy hour menu, so I wish we were told that or had been granted the happy hour prices, considering at that point we were only a few minutes to the hour. 

Once it was time, we ordered three trays in total. The oysters were fresh and tasty and came with all the right condiments to complement them. The place filled up quickly and everyone was friendly and chatted with us. It was the kind of environment I could have easily stayed and had a few more, time permitting. I def recommend going to Boone's for oyster happy hour if you are in Maine!"
2118,"Stayed in Old Port last weekend and stumbled upon this place for dinner Saturday night. What a surprise! The food was great, the staff even greater. The young man that attended the fire is a real gentleman. Thank you for the lovely fireside dining and hospitality. Will make this a regular stop."
2119,"What a great evening. The staff was wonderful, helpful and courteous. The food was in incredible. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was perfect. Not too much cheese. 

Our whole table was impressed with their food. Sorry we were too full to try deserts. Maybe next time. 

It was a slow night so we were the loudest table. But had a blast connecting with old friends and sharing stories."
2120,Boone's is the complete package! Awesome atmosphere - deck or inside - two stories with both options. Oysters are great as always with a nice selection. I had a scallop BLT which was delicious. My mother had a lobster roll which looked loaded and amazingly delicious. Nice drink menu and our server was really great!
2121,"The lobster roll was terrible.
Not very much lobster meat & at $32.00 way over priced. My wife ordered the lobster Mac & cheese. It had 2 pieces of lobster meat that was cold & impossible to chew. That was way overpriced too, at $32.00."
2122,"What an over priced rip off, this better categorized as a $$$ or $$$$!  $32 a pound for lobster up-charged from $4 a pound!!!  It's on the water but hardly worth it.  Both the lobster on the mac and cheese and the roll were cold.  If you want to spend this amount of money on seafood but want a great experience go to Eventide. Lastly the pickle wasn't even pickled, it was cucumber.  Send Gordon Ramsey to this nightmare of a restaurant."
2123,Let's start by saying our visit included my buddy getting gum stuck on his pants from under the table. They did not have lobster bisque soup which was surprising and the lobster roll was overpriced. The server was good and no complaints there. Had the Mac and cheese as a side dish with no fork . I am not going back there for sure.
2124,"Tonight dinner was the oddest experience....I arrived there early to take advantage of the $3 house wines at happy hour. My first shock was having to pay $6 an hour to Unified parking in a lot that was free if you were dining at Boones or Gilbert's. Gilbert's still has free spaces, but not Boones. I told the manager I was there and to let my guests know that I'd be on the deck for happy hour. He insisted that had honor happy hour prices if we took our table.  This was only partially true. He'd honor it for one drink and not on the apps. So no happy hour deal and paying to park. Hmmmm. The seafood platter tasted like it had been cooked in very old oil....my friends loved their newburg and  hanger steak though. We were overcharged on the gazpacho, so they comped it when we brought it to their attention, but the manager told us we made the server feel like it was her fault for the overcharge....and we in no way did that..... we were made to feel very uncomfortable.  Just a very odd experience overall. Not sure any of us will be returning. I used to adore this place...not so anymore."
2125,Our waiter ruined the entire dining experience. He came to our table a handful of times and made us feel like a bother to him even when we were just trying to order or ask for recommendations. He brought us 2 incorrect items that we  didn't ordered but we were so hungry and he barely came by that we ate it anyway. Would not recommend this place.
2126,"Highly recommended place on the docks for a good time - but do come here with some time on your hands.

We came in at about 5PM for an early dinner and the place was already packed. We were lucky to grab a spot outside on the patio and it was a beautiful location for a lovely, romantic dinner. 

The place is staffed right but the servers are always busy. The wait times for the food are high. We had to wait for about 15 mins to get the server to come up to us with the menu. They have some freshly baked bread for starters but took about 45 mins for the bread to come in to our table. The basket had an assortment of bread with some butter on the side. 

The drinks were served but we never received any refills for them as the server was never there to take care of the table. 

The food however is why this place gets 4 stars. We ordered Lobster mac and cheese which came in with a rich, creamy sauce, hot pasta, well cooked, buttery lobster pieces and crispy, panko breadcrumbs topping. The lobster was buttery and the recipe was the classic mac and cheese taste. 

They offer a wonderful twist to the traditional poutine - The Lobster Poutine! The Gravy is made with Lobster and we confirmed that does not have any other meat items added to them. The french fries in the dish are crispy. The amount of lobster added to the serving is generous. It is the gravy and the buttery lobster which makes this dish stand out. 

The wait times though too much resulted in some mouth watering food coming out of the kitchen. It is a great place to hang out and have dinner with friends. During summers the patio is a great place for a romantic dinner and a great time."
2127,We had a party of 16 and the service was fantastic!  They accommodated all of our requests and was always available when we needed something. The food was outstanding and we a great time with plenty of space.
2128,"Used to enjoy this place, not so much anymore.  So, it's 4:30pm on a Tuesday, and you can only sit at a table outside if you're having DINNER.  Had drinks (4 of us) and apps, and not one table was ever used...Lame.  The place looks the same, but the atmosphere (it was empty, completely) and the staff just doesn't have the same feel.  It's like nobody is in charge and nobody cares.  Lastly, heard this place was sold on June 1st which explains alot...."
2129,"Waited an hour and forty-five minutes to receive our food and we had a reservation 2 weeks out! Why didn't I leave? Our waitress said there were a couple of big family parties that had orders in ahead of us. I don't guess that mattered. That was one hour in. Didn't realize we were still forty five minutes away! Had to go to the bar, find our waitress, and tell her we were leaving to get food to the table. They comped our first round of drinks. Thanks! Good luck here on a Saturday night!"
2130,"I was pleasantly surprised by Boone's and am glad I tried them without looking at reviews. 

Skylar is awesome! She was super attentive and gave great suggestions. These guys have an awesome Maine beer selection. The stuffed lobster is awesome. I actually love a plain steamed lobster and this was my first time. It was really good. My mom had the fried oyster sandwich. The oysters were juicy and flavorful. 

Definitely stop in and sit on the patio!"
2131,The restaurant was clean and nice atmosphere. Wonderful service. I had the baked stuffed lobster and a cup of clam chowder. The stuffed lobster was not for me. The seasoned stuffing overpowered the lobster and it had a very fishy taste. My guess is because the stuffing is cooked in the empty lobster shell. I was very disappointed with the meal. The clam chowder was very good.
2132,"I'm a wondering why our hotel concierge recommended Boone's for a quick lunch that took 90 minutes and was absolutely nothing memorable.  $32 for a hotdog bun size lobster roll is ridiculous, even in peak tourist season.  It wasn't even that good with a few large pieces of chewy lobster.  The fish sandwich and cold fries were not good also, certainly not worth 1/2 the price.  I should have left after it took so long to be served and our waiter left us for long periods of inattentive service.  With our waiter nowhere to be found, I  had to pay at the hostess station as the final insult."
2133,There wasn't an outdoor table available yet so we had a drink at The Porthole next door. Within 10 minutes we got a call that our table was ready and they promptly brought a bowl of water over for our dog. Service was fast and food and drinks were delicious. Definitely recommend!
2134,"The owner was so so so nice! They had a special event happening upstairs and because of that had some special gluten free menu items that were amazing. Gluten free Mac and cheese balls, gf date and cheese stuffed mushrooms--all also vegan!--Were amazing. I loved their happy hour items as well. Love the oysters!"
2135,I had a cup of chowder with a paper towel in it. A big piece of paper towel. Then my salad had hair in it. Took me awhile to post this. Came up in conversation the other night. Have not been back. Was not handled well by staff.
2136,"This place is cool to stop in to grab a drink but if you are looking for a nice place for dinner I would recommend going elsewhere. While the food was okay, it was underwhelming considering how expensive everything was. If the prices were lower then it is worthwhile. It just felt like a place trying for high end dinner and quality but that they missed the mark.  On top of that, there was lack of cleanliness and/or attention to detail. I was brought a wine glass (with wine poured into it) with clear lipstick smudges all over it from a previous guest."
2137,"2 stars for the location. 0 for the food. 0 for the (lack of) service. 3 of us - we ordered mac and cheese, swordfish entree, chowder, chicken Caesar salad and Kung pao fried oysters. 

First off, we were sitting at a small bar upstairs. Couldn't have been more than 8 people there. Bartender didn't even acknowledge we were there for almost 10 mins. Seemed like he was lost in space or on drugs. Then after we flagged him down, we remarked to each other that we thought he would screw up the order. App came out last. Caesar salad had no chicken. Chowder sucked. Oysters were over the top bad. When chicken came for salad it was burned and dry. 

Just a crappy experience for 125 bucks. We felt like we had to fight to get the oysters taken off the bill. Will never come here again. Way overpriced."
2138,"On recommendation I made reservations here, we were early but they accommodated us. We sat on the upper patio which was nice. I found the food to be good, not great and the stuffed lobster was good,  not great and certainly overpriced at 65.00. Service was friendly but not overly eager to make sure we had everything we needed.  I would probably not recommend this place based on the price and service."
2139,Had dinner here in October.  The lobster was disgusting.  There is a reason it's so dark in there.  The drinks were good as was the service.
2140,"Location is nice, but avoid this place. Waiter was incompetent, took an hour to get our food. Fish tacos were bland, chicken sandwich literally had 1 chicken tender, fries were soggy. You know its terrible when you need to type your review while still at the table."
2141,"If you want to try a different fish, come here they have a variety of local fish and some far away. There is more of a variety in the non dead of winter months, but still have a variety of 6 during these cold winter months.

Good selection of local drafts, fresh ingredients and  great food!!

Definitely one of our favorites to stop by and see what's new!!"
2142,"Over-priced, butter soaked garbage that will make you sick until you kick.  Go there to drink when Portholes has live music, so you can sit and listen.  If you like to pay a 100% premium on food that will make you regret every bite - after an hour wait for food from order - then this is your place."
2143,"Came here Friday night with my fiancee with the hopes of using the giftcard that we had. She got various posters which she was very pleased about.  I don't eat seafood so I ordered the filet mignon, comes with dill and horseradish mashed potatoes, asparagus and carrots, but I was ablento substitute the asparagus and carrots for their brussel sprouts. I got my steak medium well. The presentation was excellent and my steak although more bloody than I'm used to, it was the best steak I'd ever had, that it brought tears to my eyes.  A steak to cry for is what I would call it.  The potatoes were excellent and the brussel sprouts are fried in fish oil, so delicious.  We got cocktails which were rather expensive but delicious and a homemade blueberry pie, which was good, but would have been better warmed up. Our waitress was very attentive and lovely, which added to the experience.  We unfortunately couldn't use the giftcard because they are no longer associated with The Rooms, which was why we went there in the first place was to use the thing, so I was disappointed in that aspect, but the food made up for it."
2144,"My experience here was very favorable. I was able to find last-minute reservations on a Friday night, and the maitre'd was awesome-- he remembered my name from start to finish on the meal. The food was excellent, and slightly less expensive than Street & Co and the other trendy restaurants. I had the Blue-Plate Special and it was great. My only complaint would be the service was not phenomenal. Before we were seated at our table, we sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before our drink order was taken even though we were the only people there, and the service was slow and somewhat neglectful. Still, overall, I'd go back, especially since they seem to be less crowded than the foodie/trendy joints."
2145,The staff are busy with their work that they don't come check with the customers. The clams have sands outside.
2146,"This restaurant has beautiful views and the waitstaff were very friendly.

Otherwise, this place is a tourist trap. We arrived and one hostess looked at me and didn't even acknowledge me. Once I got the attention of the other hostess, we waited 45 minutes for a quoted 30 minute table. Not horrible - but when we arrived back the hostess was too busy socializing to begin seating us.

We ordered our drinks and oysters, both good and take no preparation. For our main dishes, we ordered the hanger steak and seafood newberg. We waited about 30-40 minutes for their arrival. The steak was cooked well rather than medium rare and potatoes fried to a crisp. The seafood was sitting in a soup of overly rich cream sauce. We made the mistake of just eating our meals because we had waited so long. Overall, it was just a terrible experience. 

There are so many great restaurants in Portland and I am just so disappointed I didn't do my research first."
2147,"Very disappointed we have been coming here a lot for a while. Never needed reservations and we have waited with out question. Today reservations only, we watched 10 parties get turned away. Very sad"
2148,"This was the best place we ate on our recent Portland trip. Lovely location on the water (it would be awesome to sit outside here but was way too cold on our trip). They had a nice fireplace as you entered and great art throughout the restaurant. Our waiter was really nice and engaged. He even complimented my friend on his jacket and seemed sincere. The menu is awesome. So much to pick from. We ended up sharing a bowl of fish chowder (soooo good) and some appetizers. You have to try the oyster meatballs. Very unique item. They had a bit of a kick too and were delicious. We also got the mussels. Done just right. For drinks, they had a great beer and cocktail selection. Mine was very strong (forget the name of the cocktail but it had whiskey). The prices were great for the amount and quality of food. I need to go back and try their lobster as I saw another table being served and despite loving my food and feeling full had immediate meal choice envy! Not super crowded nor loud for a Saturday afternoon although I bet in the nice summer weather it could get pretty packed."
2149,"The staff was help full ,but sorry the food is way over priced ( 64 US dollars for 2 lobster rolls in the state of Maine) but if price wasn't bad enough the meat in it except for the tail meat smelled a little old and was sticky like it wasn't very fresh, no sweet flavor no mayo. Go somewhere else and enjoy your dinner"
2150,"I really wanted to like this place but it rides the line between ehhh...and ok..their location by the water is great and finding off street parking was bonus. atmosphere was great and service was pretty good. Food was hit or miss. I had the blackened fish  (hake for that night) and it was too salty for me. With the hash that went with it (which was good), a little citrus would have been perfect balance. One of us got the lobster roll and though I loved that the extra drawn butter came in a little fondue like container, the lobster meat was lacking in the roll, especially for the price. One of us also got steak and their house steak sauce was weird, cold chutney/jelly type of thing. veggie side was flavorless as well. It also did not help that I got locked in their bathroom stall as their doors were not working. not sure if i'll go back as there are so many other options in the area."
2151,"Back to Boone's again but this time it was a whole new experience.  Food, per usual, was very good.  However, this time the staff could not have been more hospitable.  Upon arrival, we were met by a very pleasant host and hostess and quickly brought to our table.  Our server was at our service immediately and continued to be attentive and friendly from beginning to end.  

My wife and I were happy to see the level of service at Boone's lining up with the other ""Rooms"".  Keep up the good work.  Hope to see you again soon."
2152,"First, I worked in restaurants for YEARS. I know how tough it is, and you have to work REALLY hard to upset me. I'm endlessly forgiving. I know even the best restaurants have bad nights. I rarely tip less than 25%. I am a dream customer. In short, I get it. Secondly, our server was outstanding; he was attentive, there when we needed him, not when we didn't. He knew the menu, steered us away from some items and pointed us in a better direction when we chose something that he didn't believe in. The food was...well, it was mediocre for a much less expensive restaurant. It was CERTAINLY not deserving of its price point. I almost laughed when he said a one-pound baked stuffed lobster was $65. I'm a local. There is about $8 in cost in a baked stuff lobster at current dock pricing. But never mind that. My horror came when I used the rest room and discovered NO HOT WATER. I checked underneath the cabinet. The hot water was turned off. I turned it on. And waited. And waited. And waited. Nothing. Zero hot water. When I was walking in, my waiter was walking out. You guessed it. No hot water for my garcon. After walking out of the rest room, I asked the front desk about it. 

""Old building!!!"" she blurted out. 

""I live in a 135 year old house, and I have plenty of hot water!"" I said. 

""Servers have other bathrooms!"" she said. 

""Mine didn't."" I said. 

""Sir, you're making too big a deal if this,"" she said. 

""Miss, I want hot water to wash my hands in, and for everyone else to wash their hands in."" 

At this point, a male host came up and said, ""It seems this is really upsetting to you. Why don't we step outside to talk about it like men."" 

So. Grossly overpriced food. No hot water in men's room. One host who has pre-planned excuses for the lack of hot water, and another host who challenges you to a street fight if you call them on their shortcomings. 

You decide. I'll never go back. There are way too many AMAZING restaurants in Portland. Avoid this one at all costs."
2153,So out and about in the Old Port decide let's hit one of our favorite locations to dine. We are met at the door by an elderly gentleman who asks reservation? We do not have one we are turned away! This is a first at all the times we have ever gone to this establishment! We were not the only ones turned away 9 other groups were turned away! There were many tables open on both the upper and lower outside decks! This was very disappointing to know they were turning so many away
2154,"Our waiter was terrific, and the clam chowder was quite good. The deck is also a great place to sit and watch the boats and Commercial Street. 

And that's all the good news. We had the tuna poke, which was both expensive and terrible. It was vinegary and sour, and it had sat too long in the vinegar and cooked way too much, so the texture was really poor as well. They did take it off the bill when they realized we had only had two bites.

The real piece de resistance, though, was the kung pao oysters. The fried oysters were beyond greasy, and there was so much oversweet kung pao sauce that they were practically floating in it. And then there was an immense amount of spicy mayo glopped on top! I've never been served something so patently inedible at a restaurant that I can remember.

We gamely fished a fried oyster each out of the mess and shook off some of the sauce and mayo and ate them. They were greasy, cloyingly sweet, and fully disgusting. 

Despite the fact that the dish was barely touched, this one was not taken off the bill. 

Maybe they can execute classic seafood well, but I was really blown away that anybody in that kitchen could have looked at that plate of kung pao oysters and thought it was fit to serve to a customer."
2155,Well this is my first review and I'm disappointed to put this one up.  This place was a total bust.  The service was good other than that the lobster roll was way overpriced and nothing special.  The oysters were good but over priced as well.  I wouldn't waste my time or money on this place at all. We didn't even take a picture because it wasn't worthy.
2156,"It's been awhile since we've eaten here. We came on a Thursday early evening and got a table without a reservation.  That was a good start. The biscuits were killer. They were flaky and delicious.  We asked for seconds they were so good.  For apps, we ordered the spicy mussels which was the highlight of the meal. The sauce was excellent; interesting and complex. I totally loved it. My friend had the haddock chowder. It was totally bland even after adding salt. We gave it a D. The main courses were a disappointment. The lobster mac and cheese was not very good. It lacked lobster and the sauce was thin and watery with not much flavor. The stuffed haddock was bland. I had the fresh bluefin tuna with wilted spinach. The tuna was fresh a delicious and cooked to a perfect medium with a yummy sauce. The spinach was a blob of green plant matter on my plate. They delivered what they stated on the menu. There was no salt, garlic , shallots or olive oil. Boring.

On a positive note, our waitress was great. She was attentive and very pleasant. She was a highlight as well.

Overall, this experience was a disappointment. At $30 an entree and a bill of $150 for 3 people, I should have been wowed but I was lulled to sleep. Other than having a cocktail on the deck, I am not coming back. There are too many great restaurants in Portland and Boone's ain't one of them."
2157,"Very surprised by the low star rating. Then again, maybe I'm not. Honkeys you know, they like to complain about slow service with a party of 20 or rude waitresses when they are being a major pain in the a** needing firewood. Anyway, this place is definitely a tourist trap but I suppose that's not always a bad thing. In a state known for lobster we found it a bit odd that the new ""hip"" places don't have it on the menu. This place definitely has lobster and it is definitely delicious. We started with a bowl of ""chowda"" which I thought was good though a little lacking in flavor--plentiful clams though. I had the stuffed lobster and my friend went for a classic steamed. They were both so fresh and so buttery and so yummy. The stuffed lobster was HUGE and the filling was delightful. Very pricey but again, tourist trap--can't say I blame them for wanting to make money. Service was fine, no complaints."
2158,"My first one-star review goes to Boone's. I've never written a one-star review so that tells you just how bad this place has gotten. No, I'm not being hard on them, there was literally nothing redeeming about the experience. 

I was in a large party (20) with a 7:30 reservation. As a former server I know large parties are challenging and would be willing to give them a pass on SOME shortfalls but this was beyond bad. We got seated almost a full hour after our reservation and not until the manager barked at one of our hosts who went to check the status after we'd already been waiting nearly 45 minutes.

Service was horrendous. We never got bread - did they stop doing that? Waitress was knowledgeable of the menu but once our orders were taken she disappeared. That meant no one checked on whether we had everything we'd ordered (we did not) and how everything was (not good). For one, everything took a long time which is somewhat expected due to our party size. I didn't get one of my sides which was disappointing but not a big deal. The worst was that two of our meals weren't delivered and only were sent out about 25 minutes after everyone else's, which meant everyone was done except these two. The server bringing our meals said about 10 minutes into this wait that they were ""just plating it now"". Yeah, right. At no point was there any type of apology for the oversight nor were the meals discounted. 

Some meals weren't cooked appropriately and those that were were just ok. I ordered scallops from the a la carte menu with beurre blanc which was either the thinnest, most bland sauce ever or missing entirely. Scallops had a nice sear but again, very bland. My side of a popover was overcooked and dry. Many in our party didn't finish their food which speaks to how mediocre the food was. 

Waitress reappeared finally to see if we wanted dessert (funny how they remember to check on the things that will increase the bill) and deliver checks. 

As I said, other than the company, there was literally nothing redeeming about this experience. It's time for Boone's to pay attention to some of these reviews and make an attempt to provide a pleasant, customer-focused dining experience. That or stop accommodating large parties if they simply can't handle it."
2159,"Tempted to give Boone's 3 stars for the view, outside bar and multiple decks...

But. 

I just can't marry the ridiculously marked-up prices with the food quality or many cheap details. Such as crappy, grocery store salt + pepper shakers, unfocused menus, or the weird wet spots/puddles I keep noticing (inside)? 

Ultimately, it just feels all over the place; needing focus and attention to detail. Service is decent. They'll probably get away with the prices for a while longer thanks to the location and ample outside dining. It could just be so, so, so much better!"
2160,We stopped here for lunch. It was a great spot with a nice view overlooking the water. We shared the pork belly nachos which were amazing! I just got a burger and he got a scallop blt. All delicious!
2161,Fabulous. We got the bacon and scallops appetizer. We were reserved due to lack of stars ... but you shouldn't be. We very much enjoyed the scallops and the tuna salad app.
2162,"Second visit this summer this time for lunch- Boones does not disappoint! We had the chowder (yum), clams (yum), lobster roll (double yum) and seafood newburgh (amazing). THEN we had ice cream and blueberry pie.  Everything was incredible, and our server Erica made the meal perfect! Can't wait to come back!!!"
2163,"Food was pretty good, over priced though, not a big sea food person, menu is pretty small."
2164,"Boone's fish house is a great place to have some oysters and kick back. I gotta say their cocktails are strrrrooooong! The atmosphere and view is great here. Food is good also. 
The asian salad is my favorite, wings are good too."
2165,"Well, I don't really know where to start with this review, happy hour drinks, are amazing since we don't have happy hour at home, so $3 for a glass of wine or a beer is amazing! We also order the happy hour calamari, which was very disappointing, I think it was because it was served in a very small bowl, but I'm not a chef, so I might be wrong. It did have a nice flavor, but the breading to our calamari just came right off, which was not very appetizing at all, thankfully our cheap drinks made up for our cheap calamari!"
2166,"We were in town for a few hours, found Boone's and had a Fabulous meal. Start to finish was absolutely fantastic. We started with the Scallops and bacon and then Stuffed Baked Haddock and the Stuffed Lobster. Nicole was a Fantastic waitress, Great smile and was very attentive. Highly recommend Boone's."
2167,The food was very good.  The service excellent.  I highly recommend this establishment.  I have the stuffed shrimp and it was wonderful.  Spouse had build your own fish.  The server recommended a sauce that was very good to go on her salmon.  Would go there again!
2168,"I'm not ever in a rush to go back. It's not that anything is bad with this place- just not worth the value. I feel like it's only expensive because it's so close to the bay and that's the only thing you're really paying for. The Downtown commercial st restaurant scene should be the place to be! But, I find myself always closer to Congress st, where the really good food is..."
2169,My husband and I were passing through and decided on this place for steamed lobster. It was my first time having it! So good! It's a little over $30 a pound for it but worth the money. The lobster was perfect and not over cooked. Butter is brought out and everything needed to crush the shell. We ordered fries and some mashed potatoes to try which were also very tasty. The patio seating in the evening was perfect with the hustle and bustle of late night bar hoppers. Live music could be heard as well. The staff was also friendly. Tons of places to grab drinks from in the surrounding area.
2170,"Fun happy hour! $1.50 oysters from 4-6 pm, plus other appetizers and drink specials ($2 beer for hubs, $5 sparkling wine for me, yay!). Party boat pulled up to dock next to restaurant while we were there, so enjoyed fun music too.

Dogs are allowed on the deck (top or bottom level) and a staff member brought pup two(!) containers of ice water - awww! Caveat to happy hour: you have to be able to find a place to sit at the bar, specials don't apply to patio/indoor table seating."
2171,"Wife and I went for late lunch around 2 pm last Friday. Great atmosphere and had a simply fantastic server named Derek who took the time to explain any dish. Wife got salmon with fried brussell  sprouts and an olive type of salsa , great!! I had fried seafood platter, best scallops I've ever had, shrimp and clams delicious as well. Great meal. Thanks again to Derek, we'll be back and recommend to all."
2172,"If you like different kinds of oysters never missed this place in Maine.
I got 8 kinds of fresh oysters."
2173,"Stopped in for drinks and steamers while driving through town. 

Drinks were really good, had the homemade blueberry sangria which was awesome and one of the many local brews they had on tap. 

Service was very good, prompt and attentive. 

Steamers were slightly sandy but still very good. 

Will definitely be back for dinner sometime."
2174,We had a delicious dinner here with a good well priced bottle of wine. Lobster Mac and cheese was fabulous and so was the haddock stuffed with lobster. The fact that we could bring our small puppy was a definite plus. We highly recommend Boone's.
2175,"I think Boone's has two very distinct personalities:
The upstairs
The downstairs

Only it's the reverse of Downton Abbey. It feels like the judgey, rich people are all downstairs; the relaxed, laughing, inviting people are all upstairs. I say this because every.single.time I've come to Boone's (which is more than you might think), I have felt unwelcome by the cold hosts. I've learned to immediately walk up the stairs upon entering without making eye contact with them.

Now, here's what I love about Boone's: the extremely polished wood look - it makes me feel like I'm drinking in a pirate ship or fancy schooner or something, the outdoor space (the view of the ocean and working port is pretty rad), the Fish House Punch (a GREAT bang for your buck), and the bar staff (although sometimes their ""hospitality"" is sooooooo over the top it begins to feel a bit disingenuous).

Here's what I don't love about Boone's: the extreme snottiness of downstairs (as previously alluded to) and the food. This is definitely not a place I think of when I plan an evening out, because as a vegetarian my options don't seem all that plentiful or really all that enticing: housemade chips and guac (historically I've found that The Rooms don't do guacamole well, so I wouldn't get this), Boone's Buffalo Fries (which actually sound DELISH, but I haven't asked if the fries are fried in the same oil as the fish is... I'm guessing yes, which means this is a no go for me), a goat cheese grilled cheese at lunch (YES! Yum! Nom! But... why isn't this offered at dinner, too?!), flatbreads, and salads. 

Of all the ""Rooms"", this one - in my opinion - also offers one of the weaker happy hour options. They do something called ""5-3-5"": from 4 to 6pm and 10pm to 12am, Monday through Saturday, you can get $5 cocktail specials (usually just two, and always including the Fish House Punch), $3 select beers, wines, and prosecco, $5-off the flatbreads which run  $11 (for cheese and sauce) to $21 (for lobster sauce, lobster meat, soffritto). I appreciate that they've got that Reverse Happy Hour at 10pm and that they include Saturday's; I also dig the $3 wine, of course, but the lone food option - again - is uninteresting when you compare it to The Corner and The Grill rooms."
2176,"A group of my girlfriends and I had the most amazing service with 5 star, coastal Maine food! Our server Tim was phenomenal and gave us plenty of time to gab between courses and gave exceptional bottle service. The steaks were cooked appropriately and the local fish was outstanding! I highly suggest the atmosphere on the upstairs deck and the host staff was more than accommodating. Smiles everywhere. This is a place we will be gathering again! Thank you"
2177,"Brisk, cold night that the moment we walked in the fire place aroma and blaze was so comforting and welcoming.

Our service was fantastic and the ambience of the restaurant was beautiful. Perfect location right on the water.

Unfortunately, our food was just not good. It's an interesting day when the side Salad and French fries alone were among the best thing you had. 

The oysters were fresh which was nice and enjoyable as an appetizer. We split the lobster poutine and lobster roll with a side of greens. The poutine had a cashew cheese that looked like a clear butter and was lacking taste and flavor. The lobster roll wasn't anything to write home about, which should be an easy lay up in Portland, Maine.

Overall, we loved our server and the restaurant but will not be back on our next trip unless there is a new chef."
2178,Food was excellent. Clam chowder and scallop blt were very good. Do have to mention that the prices are high. Food taste and quality were very good though.
2179,"This time 12 of us went back to the Old Port Sea Grill.  This was our third time there and I can see changes being made.  Not bad changes but I'm not sure that they really work for our group.

First, the restaurant seems to be getting more expensive than it was.  I felt it and other people commented on it, but I didn't save any receipts from previous visits so I don't know if the prices are really going up more than inflation or not.  A lot of people went for the fish and chips (one of the cheapest things on the menu) and I don't remember that happening before.

Second, it's a loud venue.  The space is acoustically very live, which is sort of inevitable with the attractive, sleek, modern decor.  Large panes of glass for windows, the fish tank, and the separation of the dining area from the bar don't deaden the sound at all.  Talking was difficult and the restaurant wasn't even close to being full at 7:30 on a Friday night.  I thought I read somewhere that sound baffles are coming, but I forgot to ask about it while I was there.

Finally, I think there's an ongoing communication issue in the front of the house.  All three times we've been there I've asked for separate checks and reminded the restaurant every time we've talked.  Two out of three times, the server wasn't told that we needed separate checks.  And two out of three times, the server didn't bother to mention that the gratuity had been included when passing out the checks.  Sure, we were a big group.  And it says on the menu that they don't do separate checks and include the tip for large parties.  But after a few drinks, I get a check for two of us and I don't think of the big party thing.  

I thought the chowder was really good but the fish in the fish and chips was a little disappointing.  I plan on going back because I like the Old Port Sea Grill, but it feels like it's turning into a spot better suited for a date night than for a group of people who like to talk to each other.

I'm giving it 4 stars this time because it didn't feel like it was as good a fit for us as it's been in the past but I'm still a fan and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
2180,"Good looking place, fair prices, good lunch choice. 

Stopped in for lunch and the place was fairly busy.  We had a party of two and were seated in the back.  Would have been nice to have a view out of their window instead of the wait staff service counter and kitchen door, but whatever. 

We were visiting Portland, but we're local, so I didn't need to get a lobster roll or anything ""New England"".  I had a blackened chicken wrap? it was really good, there were a bunch of other things in it for flavor, but I can't remember what. . Came with fries, also good, and the pickle was outstanding. Filling portion, no complaints.   NOTE: I don't ever order wraps, but this was a good choice. 

Service was fine, but then again we're pretty low key.   

I would return for lunch, or maybe happy hour too. 

PS: Going to the men's restroom is an adventure....you'll see what I mean. No biggie,  just don't wait to the last second it's technically not in the restaurant"
2181,"Came here for lunch on a Monday with friends. It was fairly empty save for a few business lunches. The staff were friendly and were unfazed we kept talking and forgetting to focus on selecting what to order. 

I got a shrimp cocktail and a bowl of their New England Clam Chowder. Both were delicious and hit the spot.  My friends also ordered oysters (I didn't have any) and fried calamari. They both liked their food as well.

This is a good spot clearly for people who work locally as well as tourists (us). 

I wouldn't mind coming back and checking out their dinner menu."
2182,"When in Maine you HAVE to have a lobster roll right? So off to Old Port Sea Grill we went. The market price lobster roll was $25 and full of big chunks of lobster. It was the cold kind with a mayo based dressing, but I think it was lacking a pinch of salt to really bring out the flavors. I felt like it was a little on the bland side. The best part of the meal though were the fries - salty, crispy and delicious. Really, they were some of the best fries I've had in a while!

I'm giving Old Port three stars because I felt like the service was lacking. The only word I can think of to describe the service is indifferent. Zero enthusiasm and not particularly friendly. Probably won't be back, but then again, I do live on the other side of the country"
2183,"Another place that was recommended to us by hotel staff for lunch.
We sat at the bar as Happy Hour was about to start. They had a lot of specials but I opted for a dozen oysters. They gave you a nice assortment of three different kinds. They were all delicious. Then a lobster roll. DAMN! The best lobster roll I ever had! Washed it all down with some hard cider.
When in Maine, you can't go wrong ordering lobster anything! They are never stingy with it!"
2184,Great service and the oysters are amazing.  Thank a.m. from Arizona where the fresh fish is few and far between.  The atmosphere is wonderful.
2185,"Old Port Sea Grill

Craving for raw bar...you know how that goes!

NICE...atmosphere was upscale and romantic.  We were looking for trendy seafood digs in the heart of Commercial St - downtown Portland...and we definitely found it!!!   

My bride and I went in for light appetizers and drinks so I cannot comment on the entree's.  

We started with a cup of  chowder which would give and chowder house in Boston a run for the money...should have had the bowl...it was that good!!!

We finished with the fried clam strips and 2 dozen little necks.  I was left speechless...as the little dudes were so fresh, clean and yummy!!

Wait staff (Jacquelyn) and owner (Laura) where soooo friendly and provided excellent service.  Rumor has it that Laura's staff is so loyal that even the clam shucker has been working with her for 17 yrs.  That loyalty presents itself with the quality of the food, staff and atmosphere. 

Experience the best...go to the Old Port Sea Grill today!"
2186,"Great location, fantastic service and awesome food. My son said his steamed lobster was the best he has ever had. My lobster roll was very good as well. The Austin Creek Patina IPA was among the top 5 beers I have ever had."
2187,"The Dream of the 1690s is alive in Portland. Old Port Sea Grill&Raw Bar is perfect for people viewing with its large picture windows, with a view of the port, tourists, locals, artists, you name it. Portland, Maine is so relaxed a woman was stopped in her car in her lane of traffic on a steep grade, doing her make-up, on her phone... and nobody bothered her about it.

The service is friendly, albeit kind of slow even when the restaurant is mostly empty. Their opening bread course with smoked salmon butter is underrated.  I ordered the lobster roll- I found the claws kinda gross. It was OK, but the French fries were addictive, along with their house ketchup.  Unfortunately, I'd say I had a better lobster roll on the side of Sonoma Mountain that was formerly on the Pacific Ocean floor (ancient oceanic fossils have been found at its summit), then on a very active (and current) Atlantic Ocean. The lobster roll wasn't bad, just OK. They have an excellent, underrated dessert course. In downtown Portland where scoop shops are competing with each other (but no Salt&Straw, nor Tillamook), Old Port is a standout.

Old Port is a fun little spot in old downtown Portland."
2188,"We had been in Portland for two days,  honestly at this point I was a bit disappointed with our choices of restaurant, and this place happened. Old Port Sea Grill was a ray of sunshine on a rainy day. Amazing food , great service. The creme brûlée was just superb. The crab cakes ( well ... I had two of those, simply amazing ! The oysters were pretty good as well, fresh and tasty. Highly recommend this place , fantastic food and good service!"
2189,"We are visiting Portland for the weekend.  Found this place via Yelp reviews.   We were seated immediately for our reservation.   Would definitely recommend.  Nice atmosphere, prompt and engaging server, excellent food!   My husband and I shared the delicious clam chowder and a salad, which they split into 2 servings for us.   I had crab stuffed shrimp and my husband had a special swordfish, both excellent."
2190,"The Old Port was a good spot to have dinner with some colleagues after a long day in the office. The service from the time we walked in was top notch & very much appreciated.

We ordered three appetizers including crab cakes, calamari & fried clam strips. All three were very good. You could tell that the seafood was fresh.

When in Maine you must try the lobster roll if you have the chance, right? Ordered up the roll and it was good but not great. Maybe my expectations were too high but I might have actually enjoyed the French fries more than the lobster roll. Again...it was good but not great."
2191,"We met up here early for a quick bite to eat. We were excited that there seemed to be something for everyone. Once we got the food it was tasty, but everything took forever!! The staff seemed more
Interested in each other than actually serving food. Our waitress was a space cadette and only perked up when bringing the check.  It was not a dining experience I wish to repeat.  Too bad because I think their menu is appealing but good grief the slowness of everything was seriously concerning."
2192,We were excited to be near port sea grill and pop in for Sunday all day happy hour for delicious cocktails yours and snacks! We enjoyed their meals. But the highlight for sure is there amazing large full Fishtank and all the stories you hear and see while you were there I highly recommend you get in and check out the tank have some food and get some delicious drinks especially on a Sunday through the all day happy hour! There is also spectacular views outside of the restaurant... Of the sea and the boats and all my livelihood of the old port waterfront right outside their window! Definitely makes for a fun time with adults and you can bring the children along with you too;). Fun time!
2193,"Came here last Thursday for dinner at 7:30. Food was good (pretty pricey, decently sized portions). We started with a dozen oysters and one of the special appetizers. We had the halibut with mustard sauce, fish and chips, and Maine lobster roll. Service was a bit slow (especially since the restaurant was not even full), but overall had a pleasant experience. I think the restaurant should consider changing the decor of the main living room. The menu and decor didn't really seem to go together. The menu is super upscale while the main dining room seems a bit cheap - the tables and chairs, the carpet, the fish tank, etc."
2194,"The old port sea grill is located right in the heart of downtown Portland in a very touristy area. The inside is not elegant or quaint, but for what it lacks in atmosphere it made up for in the quality of the food. 

The drink menu is unique and they have a lot of local beers on tap. We ordered a dozen oysters, which were a dollar off for happy hour. They have a bunch of different types of oysters and a description of the taste of each, so it is easy to choose. They were so fresh and delicious! 

The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We also ordered a scallop appetizer which my boyfriend said was amazing. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious. If I'm ever in Portland again I'll definitely come back!"
2195,"I do not recommend this restaurant. There are so many other delicious places to go in The Old Port that don't cost a fortune. Bottom line for what they charge the meal, staff, ambience lacks."
2196,"Nice spot for seafood on Commercial Street.
We came to Portland to celebrate our anniversary. We came here based on Yelp recommendations and weren't disappointed. Greeted promptly and brought to our table. Nice raw bar selections, and seafood menu. Oysters were fresh and sweet. Broiled scallops were well prepared and tasty. Friendly, efficient waitstaff. Great beer and wine list also. With plenty of dining choices in the area,  this place was as good as any. A pleasant dining experience in Portland."
2197,"UNICORN SIGHTING IN PORTLAND.  Really friendly (10points) and a ""Perfect 10"" for food.

We are visiting from Ft Lauderdale and has just a half a day in Portland. We were hunting down raw bar joints with clams, in the rain, with two kids.

For a place that doesn't carry hi-chairs, they took us in right away, and were so nice. 

Chapter 2: The food was amazing. Get the butter noodles for kids. You could tell they shave the Parmesan right off the block. And, holy oyster shell. This bra bar was amazing. Our waitress recommended her favorite and lo and behold, they were the best. My husband loves fish and chips and said this was the best he's had.

Then I asked about the local beer and if I could buy one of the glasses and the owner brought it to me herself.

Go, just go. Don't stop, pass go, and eat here!"
2198,"We came here on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The atmosphere was bright and I liked the large fish tank/fish decor. Our waiter was awesome and made very good beer recommendations!  Despite this, the service was quite slow, especially given that the restaurant wasn't very busy.  Other people who came in after us received their food before we did. I ordered the Spicy Fried Oyster BLT Salad and asked for dressing on the side. They still put the dressing on the salad, but luckily, the salad was dressed lightly enough to my liking. Overall, the food was good, but pricey for what it was. With all of the other restaurants in the area, I doubt we'd be back."
2199,"I've been to OPT several times for drinks and never had the urge to try their food. I should've listened to myself and grabbed a cheap bite from somewhere else.

Although I couldn't see the plate of mussels clearly because it was so dark, I could smell them from another table. I thought hey, let's give it a try.

I was immediately disappointed.

There were 20-25 mussels on the plate and about a quarter of them were still closed/couldn't pry open, so presumably dead before cooking. Their definition of ""chorizo"" was a couple of paper thin slices of pepperoni and it looked like they dumped half a bottle of dried saffron on the plate. 

The waitress was nice, however.

Although I didn't try any of their other foods, the quality or lack thereof with this simple dish speaks for the rest of the menu.

Save your $14 and go elsewhere."
2200,"Two words: happy hour. At the risk of letting too many people know about a good secret, if you like oysters, this is a hard special to beat. 

They have some decent drafts that are all $3.00 (Peaks Organic, Lone Pine, Moat Mountain, etc.), and I believe a select wine and drink are also $5.00. Almost all the oysters drop from $3.50 to $2.00 and they are excellent oysters, not the throwaway ones you can sometimes get at other ""buck a shuck"" joints. There are usually 4-5 varieties to choose from as well as little neck clams for $1.50 if that's your jam. Plenty of accoutrement like mignonette, hot sauce, cocktail sauce, a little horseradish, and the essential lemons. 

We always tend to sit at the bar, and the service here is friendly, helpful and just fantastic even when they're busy. The atmosphere is dark and a little chic, but not super upscale by any means. At least at the bar, you'll mingle with both people just out of work in suits and locals from the waterfront that know a good deal and fresh oysters. 

Across the street you'll get some places that seem a little more Portland waterfront-y, but sadly at most the food, service and atmosphere has really suffered over the years. I'm not a big lobster fan, but the lobster rolls at the Sea Grill look pretty massive going by, and I would definitely trust them here over other nearby restaurants if it were me."
2201,"Stopped in for lunch in our coastal road trip. Top tier quality facilities over looking across the street from the Portland Bay. Ordered the large seafood sampler plate pictured which had my choice of James River oysters, little neck clams and delicious boiled shrimp. All was delicious although we were a bit disappointed with the 1lb cold lobster...it seemed a bit fridge fatigue not quite as fresh as one would have expected. Ordered another dozen littlenecks and highly recommend!"
2202,"Great seafood!  I had salmon and was also able to try the halibut - amazing!  (And I'm a fish snob). So this says a lot.  The fish tasted fresh and was grilled to perfection.  We were also seated next to the fish tank near the entrance!  Love that!  Overall the restaurant is a nice location, a little pricey (at about $130 for a dinner for 2, plus a couple drinks) but worth it!"
2203,"Very good food! We had to the lobster (of course...) and it was tender and tasted very well. Also the shrimp pasta and the halibut were really tasty. I like the food and the atmosphere. A little pricy, but got good value for the cost."
2204,Our dinner was a welcome respite after traipsing around in 100 degree heat all day. The server and manager helped us select a delicious bottle of wine. The calamari appetizer was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. Our halibut entrees were also delicious. The sugar crust on top of the creme brûlée was a little thick but the fact that it wasn't served cold as many others do made up for that. We had great service and an all-around excellent dinner.
2205,Great restaurant.  Had fish and it was great. Really good service.  Comfortable environment down on the main drag.
2206,"Enjoyed our time with my wife & young daughter. Appetizers were great, muscles & crab cakes were amazing. Salmon is perfectly seasoned & savory. Service was equal if not better than our meal. Our  service member was awesome & very personable, her name was Vasiliki. 

- Joe, Michelle & Rylie"
2207,"Pretty mediocre for the price. Had lobster pasta which was ok but very salty. Burger was fine but nothing special. The crab cake appetizer was good, as was the tomato basil soup."
2208,The food is very good.  I had lobster and little neck clams which were great. My wife had a lobster roll and seafood chowder which was very good. I love oysters however their pricing was double that of what the other restaurants charged for the same if not very similar selection.  Overall it was a very good meal and I would go back.
2209,"Barrington Burns loves fast service about as much as he loves good food and this place had both!  My wife and I stopped here during a long weekend labor day trip in search of appetizers and drinks, and we were not let down.    We were passing by a local chowder house (I won't say to preserve their reputation, everyone has an off night) we had hoped to grab a bowl of soup at before searching for a full dinner, but the place we wanted to go to smelled like a septic tank exploded upon walking in the door.  Not a good sign for a seafood place.  We turned our attention to the sleek looking restuarant down the street - the Old Port Sea Grill & Raw Bar.

There we got a bottle of wine (good selections), 2 bowls of clam chowder (loaded with great stuff), an order of fried calamari (generous portion), a dozen littlenecks (WOW, fresh as can be!) and a barrel of laughs (we brought this from home...lol!!!!)!  My wife and I were seated right behind the fishtank, giving us privacy and something cool to look at. We even spotted a sea urchin!!! In Japan they call those ""Uni"" I believe, at least once it's on your plate!  

The waitress was very nice (hope our tip was too!) and we had a great time.  Thank god we kept on walking!"
2210,"Meh.  This place is practically empty for lunch, even when other local places are jam-packed.  It's clean, modern, and quiet from a decor perspective.  We each had a clam chowder, which was lukewarm, and flavor-wise was acceptable to fair.  They don't serve bread during lunch service, which is a bit lazy and cheap.  Service was pretty darn slow, despite the fact that the menu has very few dishes (and no kids menu even though it's in the tourist center).  I came here when it first opened, years ago, and it was terrific.  Now, not so much.  Burger was a bit burned on the outside (over/charred), making it a bit dry.  Fish tacos (blackened) just didn't hit the right notes; perhaps the fish quality wasn't up to my standards.  Lobster roll (off menu, made with butter and not mayo) came with HUGE chunks that you couldn't eat without deconstructing it and cutting it smaller, then remaking your sandwich.  Again, lazy kitchen staff.

High points included crispy, hot French fries (kudos), and tasty raw oysters.  Still, any chefs have long left this place, and I'm guessing it's a couple of line cooks sending out food for a salary.  With all the great places to eat in Maine, this is one place you can skip.  Too bad, since it's a cute modern place near Old Port."
2211,"Dinner for eight. I had the grilled trout which was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with a hint of smoke bathed in a light and flavorful citrus based sauce with tender, thinly sliced mushrooms. Both well balanced to enhance the delicate flavor of the fish without overwhelming it. Rissoto side was also excellent. Others had shrimp, lobster and fried chicken. Shrimp and lobster were also very good. The chicken, however, was a bit dry.
Appetizers and entrees were timed perfectly and waitress was friendly and very attentive. We were thirsty from walking the day in 85 degree heat and sun, but our water glasses were readily replenished. Excellent dinner overall. Best meal we had during our two day stay in Portland. Highly recommend."
2212,This was a great dining experience! I started off with the wedge salad and it did not disappoint. A large wedge with plenty of blue cheese. My entrée was the halibut which was a perfect ten! A generous piece  of halibut complimented by veggies and a large square of Augratin potatoes. The fish was cooked to perfection and the meal was flawless. Because I had not stuffed myself enough I decided to go for the cheese cake which again was fresh and tasty. The bartender was attentive and knew her trade. This was a great dining experience. Be  prepared to pay but you get what you pay for.
2213,Great food and great service.  The clam chowder is top notch. I also enjoyed the fish and chips and the Lunch IPA.  Great combination.
2214,COMPLETELY shocked by the low star average. This was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. Yeah service was a little slow and I had to ask for the chowder we ordered but it was Friday night and the place was packed so the little things get a pass. Plus the food was DELICIOUS!!!!! The martini I had was vodka and earl grey tea which was too good to not have two. We started with some raw bar items which were all fresh and delicious and the aforementioned clam chowder which was creamy and full of clams. We got the steamed lobster and lobster pasta as entrees. The steamed lobster was cooked to perfection and was served with steamed littlenecks (yum!!!). The lobster pasta was the shining star of this show. My friend and I agree that the pasta could have been $200 and it would be worth every penny. So much flavor in the sauce and a wonderful and simple combination of veggies and lobster meat. The place itself has a bit of a stuffy rich person vibe but the food is totally next level. 10/10 would recommend.
2215,"Dined here on a Saturday evening 
Reservations were easy. 
Service was attentive   
Clam chowder soup was ok. Just as good as Legal Seafoods  
Halibut was great. Stepped it up with a wild mushroom risotto 
If you took this restaurant and put it any where else other than Portland you would have a line out the door. But Portland is a hot town for restaurants. Going to have to step it up a bit to keep up"
2216,Five star service and food. Nikki the hostess helped me set up a group dinner for 15. She was amazing and made everything perfect. The food was out of this world and the local microbrew selections were fantastic!  Will definitely return!!!
2217,"This is one of my favorite places in Portland. I held off going in here for years because it looked high brow, and that's not me. I was pleasantly surprised when I went in, there is a diverse crowd, anyone from a fisherman to a business person. I particularly like the bar. The food is excellent, well thought out menu and reasonable prices for the quality. The staff is always courteous and super attentive. You wouldn't expect it from a ""seafood"" place but they definitely have the best burger in town. I enjoy my time Everytime I stop in. The beer selection is limited but they have a nice wine selection."
2218,"I like the sea grill. It's been a player in the old port restaurant scene for about 15 years, so something is working. I enjoy the bar scene here....easy to people watch outside and seating is always available. 

I'm not giving a lengthy menu review...primarily because I use the Sea Grill as a great happy hour raw bar spot. I find better competition for the general seafood they offer. Eating from the raw bar menu, and sitting at the bar....is what this place has going in my eyes. 

6 to 8 local varieties of oysters, clean and nicely shucked. It's 85-90% of Eventide, without the hellacious waiting times. Cherrystones, shrimp, cold lobster, and other seasonal raw shellfish, all at great happy hour prices on Mon-Friday....If you like raw bar.....this is your spot.

4 stars...I recommend"
2219,"This is my happy hour spot. $5 wine, beer, and manhattans. Or cosmos. I'm a gentleman so I stick with the manhattans. Oysters are also on HH special. Well worth the pop-in to get your night started or post-work relaxation session. 

Service staff is some of the best. Always a smile and quick with a drink. Leaha and Bailey, but go with whomever is there. Because they are the ones serving you. So there's that."
2220,Cute little restaurant. Nice for a nice and appetizer. Atmosphere was okay. Mussels were excellent as well as the drinks. Service was okay.
2221,"Wow , I can hardly say enough about the amazing experiences my wife and I had in this restaurant. This place really knows how to take care of their guests.  The raw bar is the best in Portland!  We had entrees too and both were the best Ive eaten in Maine.  I recommend coming here more than once!"
2222,"We had dinner here before a concert out on the Maine State Pier, and will definitely be back. 

Very nice cocktails, and bread with a smoked salmon spread, began the meal. I had the simple grill salmon (which came with fingerling potatoes and green beans). While the salmon was a touch over cooked, the flavor and texture was excellent. 

The spouse's grilled steak frites was also a touch overlooked at the edges, but perfectly cooked at the center. The fries were crispy and good. 

It looks like they have a good happy hour - drink specials, deals on the raw bar - so we will come back for that. The dessert also looks very interesting!"
2223,"Horrible service. I gave a lot of places 4 and 5 stars around the area but the service was too bad not to write a review. Cannot stress enough how much I wanted to give a 1 start but the food was ""decent"". Would highly reccommend Davids Restaurant!!"
2224,"I've been here twice and it was unbelievable both times. I went two years ago and thought maybe it was a fluke but I was proved wrong. I got the NY strip and it was amazing. It was cooked a perfect medium rare and melted in my mouth, I barely had to chew. The mash potatoes were heavenly and the asparagus and sauce was amazing. The raw bar was also unbelievable. Everything was impeccable. I'll go there every time I'm up there."
2225,"Just great! Greeted by a very friendly staff. Shown right to our table. (Even though we were a bit early for our reservation.) Our waitress, Jacqueline, was wonderful! ( We left a 40% tip!) The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was pleasant. My wife and I both had the whole Maine lobster, they shelled mine for me, my wife wanted to do it herself."
2226,"We had a very tasty meal here.  Its a bargain place in a great location. You walk down a few steps.  It feels like a basement.  We were very happy with the quality/value/service.  Its dated you so have to those expectations before you come.  The $23 lobster dinner was really great.  We were seated by the large fish tank. It was a weekend night. The restaurant was half empty.  The service was warm, friendly and helpful.   The lobster was perfectly cooked and well presented.  The french fries and cole slaw were surprisingly good.  One of us had fish and chips - huge portion of very lighted crispy coated fish also perfectly cooked, moist and yummy. We felt taken care of by the wait staff.  Wine was fine, salad just OK but not overpriced.  We wanted to try the mile high peanut butter pie but did not have room.  Having had a far worse meal at twice the price the previous night we would go here again."
2227,This place is awesome! The food is delicious and a great amount. They are also gluten free friendly and dairy free friendly! Their customer service is awesome and always smiling! I also love the fish tank at the front of it that can be seen on multiple sides. Definitely a good place to go for lunch or dinner!
2228,"We came as a large party (14) with kids, and both the food and service was fantastic.

I had the grilled salmon, which was excellently cooked, and the mussels which were in a fantastic red sauce."
2229,"I came here for dinner. They have pretty good French style dishes and nice beer. In addition, the raw oysters are fresh and I like the cheese they provide for the bread.
The cheese is made from salmon and original cheese. This gives a special taste for the bread.
The appetizer I ordered is crab cake, it is well fried and comes with roe sauce."
2230,Happy hour was very quiet.  Enjoyed 2.00 oysters.  They had 5 different varieties and they were EXCELLENT!  Shrimp taco's with FF's was huge and very good.  The calamari was good but for 10.00 on the small side.  The Bloody Mary was made perfectly!!  Would go back to try the regular menu.
2231,Three of us had dinner here on a Saturday night and ordered seafood and were very disappointed. The mussels were extremely large and a bit chewy which leads me to believe they were Not native and the sea scallops were tasteless and previously frozen. I know seafood!
2232,"We had a great dinner last night my lobster roll one of the best i every had with perfectly seasoned fries. My wife had the pasta with lobster in a light sauce very delicious.
And the dozen oysters were perfect also had lunch by Maine beer company yummy yummy beer.And by the way the waitress service was perfect. Looking forward to our next visit"
2233,"Very, very good experience! Firstly, we got a table immediately on a Saturday night -a small miracle. Wanted to be in the bar area but we happily took what we were offered. Bread & smoked salmon cream cheese spread was excellent. Had mussels for an app and they were superb. The briny-savory broth contained sausage (andouille?) which was inventive & delicioso with crostini. The mussels themselves were fat, I've never seen them that plump & extra tasty. Simple swordfish with red pepper sauce was great -green beans & new potatoes were savo-riffic.  The only slight negative is the I would have liked to taste the vino b4 ordering a bottle-asked 2x but no go.  The sommelier was knowledgeable and nice-but no amount of description can convince my tastebuds what to think. Wine was just a so-so pairing so be sure to just order by the glass if you like your Chardonnay a certain way!!  Overall a 4-star nite & will not hesitate to return!!"
2234,The food was amazing.  I had the scallops and they were cooked perfectly.  Service was great as well.  I will definitely eat here again on my next visit.
2235,"Love the restaurant, and love the staff here. Justin, the dining manager, is the consummate host, always ready with a smile and a nice table. Go here, you won't be disappointed!"
2236,"Prices are reasonable for a restaurant in a hip part of town. We ordered the lobster appetizer that they served warm with drawn butter for us and it was fantastic! And it was only $20. Shrimp cocktail, big one, was $3/piece which I thought was a steal. We also ordered the grilled broccoli - yum! They also all day happy hour on Sunday so the oysters were $2/each. Service was friendly and attentive. Would come again."
2237,"Three stars only because of the oysters. Food was mediocre, not for the price you pay. Oysters were very good, swordfish was cool when severed, Caesar salad was ordinary/bland, and the batter on the fish and chips was soft not crisp. Service was ok, our server wasn't very attentive, but other servers were hustling and attentive to their customers."
2238,I expected a different ambiance. It is a bit more on the casual side. The bread came with delicious a salmon spread. The oysters phenomenal! The clam chowder had bacon and a tad spicy. Crab cakes were amazing! Lobster pasta was nice and light but extremely little lobster. Fish and chips excellent and ordered a side of mashed that had not flavor. Not sure we would come here again for the price and the ambience and food and quality was not truly a fan. Customer service was good and everyone was friendly just not my cup of tea.
2239,"Went for lunch on a Saturday. Service was great.  Food was timed perfectly. We had oysters and mussels. They were delicious. I also had the special panzanella salad. It was good, except for the pesto dressing. That gave it an odd, bitter, flavor. I've had panzanella salad many times, and have never had it with pesto.  (Unfortunately, the bathrooms needed a good scrubbing).  However, all in all it was enjoyable. I'd visit again."
2240,"Visited at lunch during the week. The menu said Cobb Salad, and I ordered Cobb Salad, but what I received was a sparse, soggy, glob of greens with long stems (so that when I took a bite I had big stems sticking out of my mouth), with minute bits of bacon, egg and munster cheese (at at least that is what they claimed was in it). The grape tomatoes were fine, and the green goddess dressing added the sogginess. I have had uneven results when ordering here (it's convenient to downtown work and meetings), but I would rate this Cobb Salad as the absolute worst salad ever. The wait staff and service are very good though."
2241,Good meal and solace with atmosphere.  Very simple menu with a multitude of fresh fish with many sauces. I had the mustard balsamic and it was not overpowering with my swordfish
2242,"I thought I'd be in and out within 2 hours, but I was WAY off. Like others have mentioned, Old Port Sea Grill definitely looks classy, so don't stroll on in with only a tshirt and shorts. I mean, I guess you could, but you might look a little out of place.

A couple Fridays ago, I stopped by for a get together with a large group, and we were easily there for nearly 3 hours. The thing is, 3 hours isn't really too bad, unless more than half of that time is spent waiting for 1) the menu, 2) the food, and 3) the check. 

I did enjoy my single highly priced oyster, it was absolutely delicious. After that, my hunger must have come and gone at least twice before my food showed up. I ordered a salmon dish, it was rolled up into a spiral with fancy mushrooms and served with a pesto sauce. It looked like a log and was tasty, but then again, I was so hungry that I would've eaten just about anything. Once our food arrived, my table cleared off our plates within ~10 minutes. I NEVER finish off my plate, so that was a huge deal for me. 

I'm pretty sure we were in the restaurant for an additional 40 minutes after that just waiting to get our plates cleared, getting our checks, and then getting our cards back. It was kind of ridiculous. 

While the food wasn't bad, the service was incredibly slow and I don't have 3 hours to spend on a single plate of food (it wasn't even fully covered in food)! The waiters WERE incredibly nice in the brief moments of interaction though."
2243,"//SPACE\\
Very spacious layout. Plenty of spaces between tables. Seemed even emptier since it was a weekend during lunch time and most people were waiting in lines across the street. Clean, professionally attired staff. Surrounding glass walls allowed every table to have a view outside.

//STAFF\\
From the host to the waiter, not only courteous but good at their jobs. Got the impression that this place takes the time to train the staff well. Waitress was able to comment on our food selections as well as make sure our drinks were not empty without intrusive effort. It made for a very pleasant dining experience.

//FOOD\\
I had the scallops appetizer, which was 3 large scallops (cut into portions) served with a baby pumpkin, cilantro, some kind of sprout, and I think chanterelle mushrooms? The mushrooms were cooked in a kind of wine reduction. The scallops were nice and smoky from the grill, just cooked. Garnished with a heavy sprinkle of toasted pumpkin seeds, which were my favorite added nice texture and flavor. Coupled with the pumpkin, was definitely enough for lunch size.

My friends had the po' boy sandwich and the fish and chips. Good portions. The clam chowder consistency was between thick and thin. Definitely more creamy than milky, but light with a sweet profile.

One thing I didn't like was the taste of the iced tea. I don't know if it was just that day, but the tea tasted over brewed. Like I got the ashy sediment at the bottom of the tea brewer. Made me actually wonder if cigarette ash had gotten into my drink."
2244,"On the way back to Jersey, we stopped here for a late lunch,even despite the mediocre Yelp reviews.I am very happy that hunger and convenience led me here.
     They have an awesome selection of fresh oysters, and I enjoyed 4 different varieties, and they were all excellent. 
     I had a bowl of clam chowder,which was uniquely prepared in that it had an almost sweet quality to it Very tasty.
     I had the best Lobster Roll of my Maine vacation here.The chef prepares it with whole lobster pieces.Very different presentation than the usual chopped and diced lobster roll,but ultimately was my favorite. 
     They have a decent beer selection and our server was quite efficient and friendly.
     Will definitely eat here again,if chance finds me again in Portland, Maine."
2245,"Excellent lobster pasta, shrimp entree, and New York strip..,all of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes. Would definitely return."
2246,"Had lunch here on a Saturday.  Great location, nice decor and atmosphere.  Lots of windows looking out onto Commercial Street.  Like a million other restuarants.  Nothing particularly distinctive.  Pricey for what was offered - not $$, more like $$$.  Moderate sized menu.  Food mediocre-to-good.  Pass on the lobster roll.  Service was unattentive and unhelpful.  It may have been that the server was new.  However, management did nothing to help her (or us) in what was a pretty modest lunch crowd.  They looked understaffed.

Nothing to recommend it.  Nothing so bad as to warn against it.  With so many resaurants in Portland, my guess is that it is the location that keeps them in business."
2247,Oysters were on point - the mussels were the best I ever had. Service was friendly but painfully slow. It wasn't super busy so not sure if kitchen is just slow or they just run at different pace.
2248,"So happy we just happened to walk into this place. Great service, good drinks, amazing seafood. Manager told us to try the Lambrusco and I am so happy we did. Delicious and my new favorite drink. Best oysters I have EVER had"
2249,"Loved this place! They only had one rose on the list but it was perfect. The sidewalk patio was super sweet, and the manager was the best! I was running on a tight turnaround for a couple light snacks, and their kitchen fell behind. She comped my whole ticket and brought my food in boxes as I was loading into my cab! They even sent me off with a cloth napkin and the silverware off the table!  Now that's a good service save! Will definitely come back."
2250,"Eventide had a long wait and I was in a hurry, so I came here. The oysters were fresh and well-shucked (no grit, still lots of liquid). They were on happy hour special on a Saturday too. The servers were nice and attentive. Honestly, the food was fine, but it was too dark in there and it seems like the decor could use some updating. I'd go back, but maybe try somewhere else first for a more unique experience."
2251,"Good place, solid food, average atmosphere but a huge bar and a lackluster bathroom situation (one shooter).  Help was good, I'd say 3 1/2 stars is right."
2252,"I was very disappointed by the service and underwhelmed by the food. The person I ate with agreed. She even emailed the restaurant about her concerns and to date, received no response. The chowder was first served ice cold and with my meal which makes no sense. I sent the soup back which you can even tell by looking at it that it was cold because it was congealed. The soup, when hot, was just a bowl of chopped potatoes. If there were clams, I couldn't find any. My mussels were good. The service....wow....slow and hard to get a hold of....water, bread, anything ... It was a task finding the waitress."
2253,"A nice happy hour spot!! They have $2 oysters, $3 beer and $5 cosmos and wine for happy hour......pretty decent. I had a dozen oysters (2 of each kind) and a glass of wine and the crab cake appetizer. Definitely better than my lunch experience earlier in the day. I know I'm a foodie.

The oysters were super fresh. They shucked it well. No fishy smell or no raw smell. The oysters were so tasty. And they had variety so I was able to try them all. Gosh that was good!!

I also had the crab cake appetizer. It was good. I've definitely had better crab cake but it was still good none the less. I like extra lumpy crab cake with large chunks of crab meat. This one wasn't lumpy, smaller crab meat pieces but it was still tasty and more crab meat than filler. It came with smoked salmon which was nice pairing.

The atmosphere was nice......an after work, professional vibe.

I sat at the bar. I was solo so the bar is my thing. The bartender was very nice and pleasant. 

I would definitely come back if I'm in the area."
2254,Terrible service. If you order a lobster you need to wait an hour and half. I will never go back.
2255,"Stopped in for lunch while visiting Portland. Located in the heart of the old port area, this is a wonderful place. 

Very nice interior with friendly staff. The food is fantastic as well. The raw bar is as fresh as it gets and you can't go wrong there. The chowder, fish tacos and tuna poke were all wonderful as well. The drink menu is quite nice as well. My fiancé got the blueberry mojito and high recommends it. The tap menu is small,  but true to Maine craft beer. 

Absolutely would recommend going if you're in the area."
2256,"We came during lunch and were a bit surprised that it wasn't crowded.  We actually enjoyed the spaciousness and quietness instead of the hustle and bustle of some of the nearby pubs.  We had Lobster, clam chowder, Fish and chips, and a couple of Bloody Mary's ($5 on Sunday).  Service was attentive and good.  I would come again, maybe for dinner and try the raw oysters and clams."
2257,"I'm honestly surprised at all the great reviews. The only thing good about my dining experience here was the service. The waiter and host were very friendly. 

The food was just not up to par, particularly when you begin comparing to other nearby establishments. The calamari had a weird taste. I ordered salmon with creamed kale, mushrooms and a butternut squash purée. The veggies were all cold and under seasoned. I have never salted my food at a restaurant before but it was the only way I could eat it. The salmon was fine, but a little over cooked. Nothing special, just very disappointing. 

My boyfriend had a simple grilled entree that came with potatoes and brussels sprouts.  Again, everything was super under seasoned. The portions were very tiny too. 

At the end of the night, I would rather spend $100 anywhere else in Portland. The price just doesn't justify the underwhelming food and decor."
2258,"Having found no space in all the restaurants in the sea front we decided to cross the street and try this restaurant

One annoying fact is that the lobster rolls price wasn't advertised, so it came as a surprise with the bill.

Kids menu was disappointing instead of Mac n cheese they had pasta with butter, a bit pricey at 7$ with no drink or dessert.

Now, we had a delicious clam soup for starters followed by lobster rolls, those are amazing and worth the price.

Also had with it a local seasonal beer, pumpkin flavoured which was amazing.

Overall a very good discovery in an area that seems filled with tourists traps. Just make sure about what you order if you bring kids"
2259,"Living in Portland all this time I'm not sure why I've never been to Old Port Sea Grill before last weekend. My husband and I love seafood. We have tried nearly everywhere. We were hunting for something new, but when I Googled this spot and came here to Yelp I kind of wrote this place off based on the photos. A seafood restaurant with tacky fish decals on the walls? No thanks. We planned to head to our usual go-to when we can't think of anywhere new - -Boone's. Luckily for us, Old Port Sea Grill was across the street and when we looked through the window, it appeared to be a lot nicer than the photos of the restaurant we saw on Yelp! As it turned out, we learned they recently had a remodel and they have a new chef -- all good things in my opinion!! We sat at the bar so my husband good catch the game. We were greeted right away by the most friendly bartender/waitress I think we have ever had. I didn't catch her name, sadly, but she has worked at Old Port Sea Grill for 13 years. She seemed to love her job and was so excited about the food. My husband asked if they had mussels even though they weren't on the menu (usually seafood restaurants/raw bars have a mussel dish and we were surprised this one didn't). We were in such luck! It turned out the mussel dish was a special that night! It was a tester the chef was trying out and we could not have been happier that we got it!! Hands-down, the best mussels we have had in Portland. They were topped with sausage the chef makes himself. I would never think to put sausage with mussels, but boy was it yummy! The sauce had endless flavor and we just wanted to drink it like soup. The waitress told the chef how pleased we were and she said he will be adding it to the regular rotation, which is great. We will be back for sure and found our new ""go-to"" seafood spot. The restaurant was large which is a plus in the Old Port, the staff was incredibly friendly and we just left feeling happy and full! We had the crab cakes too which were delicious, melt in your mouth texture, and served with some kind of a beet sauce that was surprising and gave a wonderful flavor combo! I highly recommend and wish I had taken photos of our food. I have one of the interior, and it does not do the space justice as the photo is a bit blurry."
2260,"A
very
fishy
place

The Old Port Sea Grill is a is an attractive restaurant located right on Commercial Street.  We have only been here for lunch so it was casual and laid back and relatively inexpensive but I suspect it gets a bit more crowded and pricey later in the day.

The menu was rather small but then it was lunch.  The usual fishy type of stuff and a few salads, nothing really exotic or exciting looking but pretty standard fare with the portions on the small side.

The decor of the restaurant is pleasant and they really exploit the fishy theme.  A nice painting of some fish on the wall and a huge salt water tank.  They leave no doubt that this is a seafood restaurant.

The food was fine and the service was prompt and attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our orders but then it wasn't very crowded.  One little quirk is that the bathrooms are out in the hall.  Takes a while to even find them and make sure you look where you're going or you just might end up in another restaurant on the way back.

There are lots of good restaurants in Portland, especially seafood restaurants, and the convenient location and the nice fishy decor of The Old Port Grill is perhaps it's strongest advantage.  A pleasant restaurant for anybody in a fishy mood."
2261,"Better than the local high end restaurants without the wait. Excellent service, friendly staff, high-quality dinning with respectable prices.  Great selection of oysters from all over Maine. Personally, I'm very pleased with this dining experience and without a doubt will return."
2262,Probably my favorite happy hour spot in Portland! Cheap of local oysters and cheap Manhattans what else do you need? The crab cake was also delicious and they have the Moat Mountain beers on tap which i love. I haven't been for dinner but intend to soon.
2263,"Had an excellent lunch here with a friend who has a lot of food sensitivities. The server  accommodated us with such professionalism. She was so pleasant, running to the kitchen a couple of times with questions. My fish and chips was perfect. The atmosphere was just right  for chatting when all of Old Port was celebrating their annual festival on a very hot afternoon. It was just right for us weary travelers. But what impressed me the most was their efforts to find and return my Spire. I wasn't sure when it left my clothing but I called all over Portland for days. I never expected to see it again and I wear it for a medical issue. The Old Port Sea Grill took my information and WOW called me a day later-they found it! This restaurant shipped it back to me at no cost and they seemed more than happy to get it back to me. Huge shout out to Justin and Nicole. You guys rock. And again, great restaurant. I'll be back again."
2264,"Prices seem to be typical for Portland, ME; however, because this was our first meal here, I was surprised by the $$$. The clam chowder was lacking -- thin cream with few clams. The atmosphere had a cold, corporate feel. The lobster roll was good -- good portion, fair market price ($24), and delicious. The service was good. If you could give half stars, I would give it a 3.5."
2265,"This place is one of those places you might just walk by as another ""corporate"" restaurant. The atmosphere is a bit conservative but the happy hour sure isn't. Great deals on oysters! Great oysters. By far some of the best in Portland and with out a doubt one of more reasonably priced."
2266,Our favorite restaurant in Portland. Returning for 3rd dinner tonight.  Imaginative menu of well prepared food.  Attentive service.  Attractive decor.  Highly recommend!
2267,"Very classy restaurant where meals are ~$30 and drinks are ~$10. 

Strawberry cheesecake martini is soooooo good... Must try those. We make better White Russians at home though.

The Arctic char was cooked perfectly with a crispy crispy skin. Came with peas and scallions in a rich but balanced butter sauce. My coworkers swordfish was good, came topped with some tomato sauce. Corn and asparagus were delicious also. 

The only annoying thing is they were out of 2 kinds of mussels, one was one we were interested in ordering. Out of scallops & calamari. I was going to order the lobster dumplings but oh guess what, they ran out too. Annoying but I guess it shows you how popular they are."
2268,Feels new though it's a Portland seafood stalwart. We liked the newly added crab cake starters and fresh scallops with velvety potatoes oddly paired with pickled cauliflower and something sweet and crunchy.
2269,"Wow. My best friend and I were there on July 16 for dinner. Our server was great (Ambassador Blair!) and the food was excellent. For once, the crab crakes were not overwhelmed with spices. The blueberry cheesecake was worth every calorie."
2270,"This was my first dining experience in Portland, ME fresh from Portland, OR. It was kind of late on a Thursday night, so there weren't very many people in the place, so I enjoyed a fairly quiet meal. The waitress was friendly and has good suggestions. 

I ended up with the lobster roll, there was a lot of lobster meat in there and the bun was really good! The fries were pretty good too! My favorite part was that I was served bread with butter and salmon pate that was also very delicious. 

I would come back here again and try some of the other things on the menu."
2271,"One of my favorite restaurants of all-time. The best oysters.  Ever.  The raw bar is outstanding,  super-fresh.  Food is always on-point. Gary always provides wonderful service and great conversation. He makes great suggestions and is attentive.  The caramel pot de creme cannot be beat."
2272,"Convenient to the Hilton, excellent service and a superb lunch special of Red Snapper Ceviche. It did not disappoint!"
2273,"One of our honeymoon spots while vacationing in Maine. We were walking around Portland and chanced upon this place, so we looked it up and it sounded decent.

The restaurant has a vibe that is hard to pinpoint, but in a good way. It feels like a cross between a local seafood mid-upscale joint and a family restaurant. The right side has a full bar and the dining area is sprawling over the rest of the room. Lots of aquatic decor adorn the walls and there are aquariums as part of the dividers throughout, which is awesome. We were seated right away by the waitress, who was very attentive and very friendly. 

The prices of the food is what I noticed first, which seemed slightly higher than expected. We decided to order a few different appetizers so as to sample a variety of foods. We got mussels, a tuna plate, clam chowder, and a kale salad. I have absolutely no regrets. Everything was delicious. Fresh, flavorful, but not too salty. The chowder had ample clams and other ingredients in it. 

My only gripe is that the table was sticky. I don't think anything was actually on the table, like spilled soda or oil or anything, but it was very odd, like a glossy table that is old and have been exposed to too much humidity. I simply placed my napkin where I would rest my arms and that took care of it, but I did knock half a star off for that. Solid 4 stars, I would come back for more!"
2274,"I've been in twice for lunch in the last month. I have had 2 really wonderful experiences. The service was impeccable. The waitstaff was friendly, polite, and attentive. The food was great! I got lobster rolls. They were fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was lovely. Beautiful aquarium. Best of all the price was not bad. Would highly recommend."
2275,"Service was great and it's in a great location near the water. Good selection of raw bar to order from. Ordered the lobster and it was super tasty. The salmon spread that came with the bread was delicious. I did not, however, enjoy the clam chowder. The potatoes were hard and the soup was just bland in general. Cocktails were good and they have a nice happy hour."
2276,"I don't know why people are hating on this place with its average 3.5 stars, but I'm a fan. I asked a local whose friend is an oyster fisher which are the best places for oysters in Portland. This place and Street and Co. were the first two named. I came here first, and I wasn't disappointed. 

When I did arrive at around 7:30 on a Thursday evening in early April, the place was nearly dead. Granted, it wasn't yet tourist season, but I had the pick of tables, which was great. I had each of the five oysters they served, and each one was phenomenal, even the kinds I don't especially prefer, like the sweeter, meatier, butterier oysters. The saltier, smaller and brinier ones were freaking awesome.

The clam chowder here tasted most excellent, although I wanted the bits of clam, bacon and potato to be bigger. De gustibus non est disputandem. The lobster roll was okay. I think maybe I don't love lobster roll, and it certainly wasn't the worst lobster roll in Portland. The lobster chunks were maybe too large. The bread it was served on was perfection, however, as were the other toppings inside the sammich.

The free bread that was served was ok, but the butter was not my favorite. It was some sort of herbed butter probably made in-house. Overall, everything was pretty good, including the service. The beer selection was ok. Apparently they didn't have the beer I wanted because they had received the wrong keg. I had a good canned IPA.

Don't hate on Old Port. Give it a whirl."
2277,"I constantly over look this obvious but very hidden gem in the old port, I guess I had the wrong impression! The old port sea grill is friendly and laid back ...Sunday's are a hidden treat, the service is prompt the bar is comfortable and the management is attentive, I highly recommend the burger and beer special or the oysters."
2278,"I have to say everything I had here was top notch.
And I had a lot:
Raw Maine oysters
Caesar salad
Mussels
Lobster with clams
2 glasses of cab
It was all dreamy.
Would go again in a cinch."
2279,The Food here is outstanding! Awesome recipe and crispy fries! Delicious and great value! Wonderful staff! Highly recommend
2280,"This place is amazing for halal foods and their fried chicken isn't too shabby either. 
I could literally eat the chicken and lamb kebab over rice with salad EVERYDAY (and a price of friend chicken or a Jamaican beef patty while I am waiting for my delights to come off the grill)
The staff is super friendly and always happy to see you. 
Best part, they're open until 2AM !"
2281,"Yeeeeeert, this some real hood shit dawg! If you ever been to the BX it's the same shit, you feel me? It's like a taste of the hood even though Portland not the hood, you feel me? Plus the Middle East movies they got on the TV always be lit if you jus smoke a wood in the p-lot before you pulled up. Issa must grab if you trap on St John"
2282,"While the food here is on the basic size in comparison to other restaurants in Portland, the quality and care they take for the food is excellent. One of my favorite options for late night food as they are open until 2am. Most places open that that will give you an aditude, but these guys are genuinely happy to see you at 1am! Love the lamb over rice."
2283,"gyros and chicken are surprisingly tasty

still thinking about the gyro I had last night this morning 

also open late"
2284,We had a great dinner here!  Service was wonderful.  We had the Lobstah Dinnah and chicken dinner. Recommend giving this place a try. We also had a wonderful drink called Peak's Island Punch with fresh fruit.
2285,"So, this is the restaurant that has opened inside the Portland Harbor Hotel. I believe it used to be Eve's at the Garden, and has recently reopened with a new menu as BlueFin.

I came here yesterday for a department lunch with some of my coworkers. I had checked out their menu online before going. Let me just say, it's pretty pricey, and the vegetarian options are extremely limited. Had it been up to me, we'd have gone to another restaurant! But, as it wasn't my expense to pay, I happily went along.

We arrived and were seated immediately. This is a small, but welcoming place. It's sea-themed, with mini ship replicas and books filling the bar area, along with a grand piano and fireplace. The bar is beautiful, and the room itself is light thanks to numerous windows.

Our server was fabulous. He was very friendly and happy to explain menu items.
I went with the daily ""soup of the land"": butternut squash with almonds ($10).
We got the roasted chickpea hummus appetizer for the table ($15).
I additionally ordered the ONLY vegetarian thing besides the hummus (and soup special): the Stonehart Farms Bucatini, which the menu said included sundried tomatoes, Tuscan kale, hazelnuts, in a sherry butter sauce ($18).
My colleagues ordered the lobster roll (market price at $21), fish and chips ($19), and the tuna tacos (I think $18).

Food took a while to come out.
The soup, while somewhat generous in serving size, was so creamy and milky that it was difficult for me to eat. The crushed almonds on top were nice, but so scarce that it was almost like ingesting a soupy, squashy eggnog. $10 was a bit steep.
The hummus plate was underwhelming. I was very glad I hadn't ordered that as my main meal.
The hummus itself was bland and didn't offer much flavor. The pita included tasted as though it had been warmed after being frozen.
I will say, the cheese included on this plate, marinated queso blanco, was 10/10. My coworkers weren't fans, but I LOVED it. Not worth $15, though. It was a scoop of bland hummus and a couple pieces of meh pita.

Our main courses came out. The presentation was beautiful on everything.
The lobster rolls were placed in small-ish rolls, but appeared to be packed with meat. Homemade salt and vinegar chips, coleslaw, and a pickle accompanied the roll.
My coworkers mentioned that the coleslaw was bland, and the pieces of lobster were so large the roll was almost impossible to eat. The flavor was pretty good though. Chips were great (I snagged one).

My bucatini was just okay. The sherry dressing sauce was so dominant that I could not taste anything else in the dish. There also appeared to be mushrooms in the pasta - which is great, I love mushrooms! But as this wasn't included on the menu, I was confused. People who hate mushrooms would probably not be pleased. 
The accompanying piece of bread had the same ""out of the freezer"" taste, and was covered in a very questionably tasting sauce. 
Coworker with the fish and chips said the ""chips,"" which were three big, overly marinated pieces of potato, were not appetizing.
The tuna tacos were dressed in a sauce that didn't go along with the flavor of the tuna.

I can't lie, I ended up having a pretty upset stomach after this meal, and I didn't even come close to finishing the bucatini. The dressing was just too much.
The presentation here is beautiful, the service is good, the location is prime, it's clean, airy, and seems to be okay.
The food, however, for the price, doesn't add up for me. Super expensive for subpar.
I'd come again for cocktails. But that's it."
2286,"One of the prettiest places in Portland is the garden of the Portland Harbor Hotel, located on the second floor. The garden is accessed through the restaurant, and you can enjoy this area with meals, or just hang out.
So generous and green-minded that the Hotel designed this space with tall trees, a grape arbor, and a fountain rather than income producing rooms. 
Portland needs more spaces like this.
If I lived in Portland, I would visit this special hide- away 365 days a year!
5 stars and a big thank you to the Hotel proprietor for designing this unique and pleasurable urban setting! More people should know about this place.

(This is what the garden looks like in the winter and in the spring!)"
2287,"We came here for breakfast during our weekend stay at the hotel the restaurant's inside (the Portland Harbor Hotel). I'll start by saying that the service was pretty good, and the restaurant was nicely decorated and felt very comfortable. All of the tables had a view of the courtyard, which was nice.  But the food was really just mediocre, which is unfortunate because I had high expectations (and because it took a pretty long time to come out, though the dining room was mostly empty).

I ordered the omelette, which came out extremely oily and very tasteless. The accompanying potatoes were pretty good. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon bagel, which he said was pretty good, though for some reason he wasn't given any cream cheese until he was over halfway done (though I guess neither of us noticed, so it wasn't that bad). Anyway, it just wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. There are plenty of other delicious restaurants in Portland to choose from."
2288,Had their breakfast in bed at Portland Harbor Hotel and it was amazing. Homemade English muffins were to die for. Reasonably priced for the amount and quality of the food.
2289,"This may be a hotel restaurant, but the chef has made it an adventure.  Unique twists on old favorites make for an amazing meal--especially the B&B salad with pickled butternut squash and pepitas!"
2290,If the service was as good as the food this would be a great restaurant. Some of the worst service I've ever had it's now at this restaurant in Maine. The food was very good but it was less than desirable I will never eat here again OK
2291,"Had brunch here on Christmas Day! Not a lot of places serving on this day so was glad to see friendly service on a family holiday. The brunch was not your typical or what one would think of. It was a special holiday menu, in addition to there regular menu. It was very modern cuisine, that fit the ambiance of the restaurant. Definitely one of the best meals I've had since being in Portland."
2292,We're staying at PHH - stopped in for breakfast- expectations were low--- we were very pleasantly surprised! Service was exceptional and the food was amazing. Oatmeal was delicious and served with yummy honey and figs. Potatoes were smashed and fried - light and crispy! Whole grain toast was soft and delicious. The prices.... incredibly reasonable - I won't be leaving the premises for breakfast this week!
2293,"This was a birthday dinner and being a hotel restaurant we realized it would be expensive, but being new in town we need to try most things at least once - twice if we like it :-)

The birthday boy had the awesome looking Pork Chop and I had the Wild Boar Fettuccine.  The wild boar was a tasty bolognese but this was the first time in a restaurant (EVER) that I've been served more meat than pasta.  The $8 chocolate torte was definitely hotel restaurant sized (tiny) and I didn't find it very nice - which was a shame because the rest was great.

The service was attentive - until the very end when we felt a little invisible once we needed the bill."
2294,"The amazing happy hour mentioned in my earlier review is long gone.  CS still has a happy hour but it is greatly pared down.  It now runs from 2-6 and (at last check) requires sitting at the bar, and is not available at the tables.  While I know this is a non issue for some, I personally prefer to sit at a table so that I can face the people I am sitting with.  I have a hard time maintaining a conversation when sitting side by side.  
There are beer, wine and martini specials with no craft cocktail and a few more snack specials which look better than when they originally pulled it all back to two or three food options.
To be fair though, the food has definitely gotten elevated with a new chef and a reimagined menu.  The overall price point has increased with these changes as well.
So...I would recommend if you are out on the town, looking for a quality meal and don't care about the cost, but I would suggest treading carefully otherwise."
2295,"We  stayed at the Westin  Hotel and ate at Congress squared

lDINNER- My husband ordered the Pork Chops with polenta and squash. It was good, but was served in a HUGE platter. The dish kind  of looked awkward on the platter. I should have taken a picture :(

I ordered the scallops with risotto. The price was outrageous for 3 scallops... It was very good, but needless to say, we left the restaurant hungry.

The Wine -Big Fire was decent for its price and tasted very good.  

They were busy and understaff, but the customer service was great! The Manager kept coming to our table to ensure we were taken cared for.

BREAKFAST- the restaurant redeemed itself, as the breakfast portion was huge! We ordered The Lobster Sliders and  Irish Boiler Breakfast. 
Service was great!"
2296,"Yeah, ""meh"" pretty much defined it.  Our friends ordered poutine and it came with an apology and no cheese curds because they were out.  Dude, if you're out of cheese curds, just say you're out of poutine.  I ordered a burger, which I almost never do at a restaurant, but did this time because I didn't really feel like anything else on the menu.  It was meh, but it's hard for any burger ever to be worth $16.  I also ordered the special beet and nut salad that was just a smidgen above meh, so we'll give it a meh+.  For dessert I got the cranberry cheesecake (in a glass)  and it was downright bad.

The server was friendly, but ridiculously confused about simple things and continuously had to go back and forth to get the answers or missing utensils.  It would've been slightly more understandable had it not been for the fact that it was us and one other table that needed service (and it was a Friday!).

Bottom line is that I would not go back nor would I recommend it."
2297,"This review is for breakfast only.  As an SPG Platinum member staying at the Westin Portland Harborview, I was given vouchers to apply to breakfast at Congress Squared.  I have to say that the food was totally fine.  Nothing really exciting, but typical, filling hotel breakfast food.

The problem with Congress Squared was the service.  On the morning we were there one server was being trained and someone in the restaurant (not sure if cook or server) called in sick.  The result was extremely slow service - from taking our order to the inordinate wait time for food despite trying to check in with our server and the apparent manager.  Given how long all this took we could've walked down to the Holy Donut,  waited in a long line, got some donuts, and possibly even walked back.  That's just not acceptable anywhere that touts itself as anything more than a Denny's style coffee shop."
2298,"This had long been on my list of happy hours to try, and I finally decided to go check it out with a friend after work. When I arrived, my friends was already at the bar and the only others there were a family of 4 sitting at the bar who I believe were hotel guests. Not only did the bar tender take a full 10 minutes to look my way, he only did so after I made a comment loud enough for him to hear. I am normally overly gracious to people in the service industry, since it can be a challenging job, and only write negative reviews when I have truly negative experiences. The reason I made any comment was because he walked back and forth past my friend and I (who was also waiting for a drink as well) multiple times to get samples of different drinks for the parents of the family sitting at the bar, blatantly avoiding eye contact and acting as if they were the only party there. After finally being served our drinks (old fashioned that was nothing to rave about), we watched him continue to fawn over the family and serve their clearly underage teenage daughter. He didn't card any of us when we ordered, and he certainly didn't card the girl who looked MUCH to young to be legal to drink. We had to physically flag him down again for our check since he continued avoiding all eye contact with our half of the bar. For a place that was so slow on a Friday evening, you would expect better service and attentiveness... But maybe that's precisely why it was so dead when the rest of the restaurants and bars in the area are bustling."
2299,"My bad--I didn't look close enough at details when I booked this place for Mother's Day lunch.  At $55/person not counting alcohol we spent more on lunch for 8 than we have at many a fancy place in Boston.  And when we arrived and I realized this it was of course too late to change.

If only the food was delicious enough to warrant $55/person.  A buffet with 2 carved meats, a couple salads, omelet station and pasta, sausages, etc in warming trays, there just wasn't anything special or particularly delicious.

Even worse, they put us in the junior ballroom rather than the restaurant itself.  There were small flowers on other tables in the ballroom, but none on our table.  A dark, boring, institutional room, the only saving grace was we could hear each other.  But we had to go out to find our server for the ""bottomless"" mimosa refill.

So disappointing for Mother's Day."
2300,"Decent restaurant with so-so food and a happy hour that ends at 6pm. They aren't terrible but I wouldn't recommend checking them out unless you are staying at the hotel and are way too tired to venture out for your meal.  

Congress Squared is located within the Westin Portland Harborview Hotel in Portland's Arts District. If you arrive for dinner and love a having a multitude of choices, you're SOL as the menu is rather limited with only a few appetizers, salads, plates, entrees, grilled items, and sides. 

OUR ORDER:
-Bread and Herb Butter: Bread is from Standard Baking Company which is allegedly the best bakery in town (according to a number of sources). Was it good? You bet! The tradeoff is that the baguette arrived cold since it was not baked in-house. The herb butter could've used more herbs.  
- Hummus Plate ($11): Topped with black garlic and accompanied by raw carrots/radishes, marinated olives, and charred pita. Hummus had a nice consistency and I love that bit of char on the pita, however, I found the black garlic topping to be too salty and not really garlicy. That was a bummer. 
-Grilled Salmon ($21): Topped with a pat of herb butter and accompanied by broccolini, tomatoes, and a lemon wedge. The salmon was cooked rather nicely as the exterior was crispy and the inside was almost perfectly medium rare. I appreciate that it wasn't excessively salty, however, I feel like that salmon could've used more seasoning. Additionally, the butter did not melt so that mouthfeel was a bit gross. I ended up scrapping that off. As for the broccolini, they ended up giving us grilled asparagus instead. Not sure what happened but they also needed seasoning. 
-Grilled Pork Chop ($19): Same preparation as the salmon but apparently better. They rendered the fat nicely. My mother really liked it and would order again!

Quick Hits:
-We missed the happy hour which ends at 6pm. I was so down for some wine specials! 
-Restrooms are a trek away. Took me a while to follow the signs and walk through the hallways. My father even asked me if I fell in when I returned to the restaurant."
2301,"My friends and I came to this restaurant liking the look of the menu. When we sat down, I asked the waitress how much the market price was of the lobster, which she said was 40$. When i asked the size of it , she just told me it was a ' whole guy '. So i assumed it'd be at least a pound and a quarter. When it came to the table, it was pre shelled with 3 pieces of meat. I just want to know how this is a ' whole guy ' and why wouldn't the waitress say that it's pre shelled? We also saw other people eating lobster that had an entire lobster. Was honestly confused and not happy at all."
2302,I grabbed dinner and breakfast here while staying at the Westin. The bartender was really nice and attentive. The scallops were perfectly seasoned and seared. The hummus platter we're tasty. For breakfast the egg white omelette hit the spot...the caramelized onions in it took it to the next level!
2303,"This place is misunderstood. Attentive service. Inventive ceviche, classic burgers, great cocktails. While the location screams hotel, give c squared a chance."
2304,"Worst service for breakfast ever.  This is a ""high end"" hotel.  Waited 20 minutes for coffee and had to beg for it.  No cream or sugar.  We're told we had to wait for server. Finally we left.  It was obvious that the staff were far more interested in re setting tables than eating on hotel guests."
2305,"I am sad to write this, as my updated review goes from a 5 star to a 3. Why, you may ask? Two words. Happy hour. What happened C2? Where did that amazing HH menu go? Where are the little sayings at the tables and the local beef burger? I labeled you as the ""Best Happy Hour in Portland"" and now all that's gone. That label goes to someone else and I won't be bringing droves of friends here anymore.  

On my most recent visit, the HH, which only can be obtained by sitting at the bar, not the whole restaurant, consisted of a 3$ slider (which was good) and a 6$ cocktail (I think it was 6$). What a lame menu. Two things? That's no Happy Hour.

So my recommendation, venture out of the hotel and find another locale for all your happy hour needs. Sorry C2, not impressed."
2306,"The food here is very good. I had scallops and they were cooked to perfection. However, the service is very slow so be prepared to wait. Wait-staff were very friendly. Atmosphere is also very good."
2307,"DISCLAIMER: Review of happy hour only! Congress squared is now one of my favorite happy hour deals in Portland. They have happy hour EVERY DAY! Even on the weekends! It is from 4-7pm and the food is more than just bites. We're talking full size meals! During happy hour the bar menu is half price! So far I've had the grilled flat bread which is a perfect size meal for one person. I've also had the grilled sirloin burger which comes with hand made fries (two servers at C2 have recommended this to me). They weren't wrong it was huge and very tasty!

Now to the real reason I come, the cocktails! The atmosphere has a very classy minimalist vibe, I would expect to have to pay very high prices here. But no! Very reasonable prices! We're talking $4 beers (some local brews like Allagash and Sebago), $5 wine of the day, and $6 cocktail of the day. I always go for the cocktail of the day, which both times I've come has been a kiwi mint deliciousness where you watch the bartender cut up fresh kiwi and mash it up to make your drink. Yummy. I hope next time I come I get to try something else though. Mix it up a bit! 

I've noticed that both times I've come the place has been virtually empty. I don't think Portland has really embraced the hotel lounge scene yet. Not sure if this is a plus or minus for me, because I do love to people watch. However, the service has always been spot on and I love all the attention my friends and I get from the staff!"
2308,Did takeout for breakfast only because it was raining and I was staying in the hotel. Mediocre food that was severely overpriced. The Eggs Benedict has no holindase sauce and should be on a piece of bread that's larger than the meat that going on top of it. Service did not feel friendly and I had to ask about whether the coffee was free. It would have been nice to have been told while I sat there waiting for the food that I could enjoy complimentary coffee while I waited.
2309,"This is the restaurant attached to the Westin but, at least for breakfast, it didn't stand out.   The service was poor - not crowded but over 5 mins to get a cup of tepid coffee, no silverware, no salt and pepper until I grabbed them from an empty table.  The food was ok - eggs, smoked salmon, potatoes, and rye bread toast.  The potatoes were delicious as was the thick rye toast.   The salmon was actually lousy tasting for some reason and the over easy eggs were over cooked."
2310,"Happy hour review only...but happy hour runs from 4-7 every day of the week, so I don't know who wouldn't take advantage of this. It's one of the best (if not the best) deal in the city.

The restaurant is in the Westin, which in any big city would be a big plus, but Portland hasn't embraced hotel restaurants yet. It's a minimalist but upscale atmosphere with a horseshoe bar and many traditional tables. 

The happy hour deals are simply incredible. 3/4 of the bottle beer selection (not the best ever, but think Allagash White/Black, Frye's Leap, etc) are all $4, there's a $5 wine selection, and a $6 cocktail of the day. Today it was 1800 tequila with maple sage syrup and soda. Unbelievable drink and very strong. Of course you can order off the extensive and great cocktail list, but the prices are high at $12-$15. On Wednesdays all of the wine bottles are half off. Combined with the food deals this would be an amazing date night.

And the happy hour food! The whole bar menu is half off and the portions are enormous. The fancy mac and cheese sounded sublime, tasted even better and surprisingly came with a full salad that was just as good. The burger was also delicious with a heaping portion of bacon and jam. The fries were homemade but a little disappointing. Still, for the happy hour price of $7 it's a steal. Flatbread pizza, lobster sliders, pork sliders, mussels, scallops, etc are a great reason to come back. And basically everything is $5-$8 with the happy hour deal.

For an upscale happy hour with huge portions, great food and classy atmosphere, I can't think of anywhere better. Plus it seems to be unknown to locals, so you don't have to fight the crowds. At least for now..."
2311,"I'm not entirely sure why I'm so into this place... but I am.

I was recently in the area with time on my hand between meetings and thought I'd check out their happy hour which happens from 4 to 7 pm: there are $5 select glasses of wine, $4 select bottled beer, and half price apps. So for $12 I got:

- a verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry large pour of some red wine ($5)
- a cheese plate that had three good sized pieces of different kinds of fromage (a harder cheddar, a softer blue, and one other I can't remember), rosemary roasted nuts (which were crunchy, meaty, and divine), toasted baguette, and a drizzle of honey ($14, but only $7 because of half price apps... for the price, I was VERY pleased; too many places in town are charging $7 to $10 for what's really just a suggestion of cheese; I would come back here again for this without a question). 
- some of the funnest bartenders I've ever met in my life

The two fellas working that night - one as host, I believe, and the other behind the bar stole the show. The host was intrigued that I was there - apparently they don't get a lot of Portlanders, and would love to have more of us come in. Both he and the bartender talked to me about the cocktail list - many of them are chosen by corporate, but each Westin gets to add a couple of their own options to bring a little local flare.

I had a bit of a falling out with the girl bartender who took over for a spell - I wanted a bloody Mary, but it had anchovy-based Worcestershire sauce in it. When I asked if she could make me one from scratch sans the Worcestshire, she flat out refused saying she had to use the premade house mix. When the male bartender came back (I think his name was Dana or Jamie... something like that) he told me that she had mis-spoken; they'd be more than happy to make me a fresh one. I never followed through with this request, so I'd like to go back and see if they really will!

If you're looking for a new cocktail or happy hour place in town, don't pass this one by (my reason for the four star instead of five is because I can't vouch for the cocktails/bloody mary quite yet... just the happy hour and the cheese plate; but, I will ABSOLUTELY be back for drinks and real food, and will bring along friends with me because locals really are missing out on this one)! There's a lot more than meets the eye at Congress Squared (and if you're feeling brave enough [and the bartenders like you enough] ask what their REAL passions are... they might just divulge)."
2312,"Avoid this place for Sunday breakfast. It would ruin your weekend. 
Waited for sooooo long (30 mins) for nothing. No one came to our seat and gave us water or ask anything. 

Leave right away after 30 mins"
2313,"I had an awesome visit today. I only wish I could recall the lady's name who was working behind the bar when I came in a 1pm. She was dressed more like a supervisor and I believe the very attentive young man was actually my bartender. But the service between the two was awesome, the conversation pleasant and warm. Probably the nicest meal I've had out this holiday season. My Mimosa was perfect and OMG I LOVED the clam chowder.. For those of you who eat bread it comes with fresh baked French bread as well as oyster crackers.

Also on their lunch menu were items like fish and chips, gouda Mac and cheese, a turkey but, an asparagus wrap, ceasar with a choice of salmon, grilled shrimp, chicken, or bacon, a bib Cobb salad, and a heavenly looking burger.

Saw a sign for a 3pm happy hour with tacos, sliders, and 5$ cocktails to name a few things. Lunch prices seemed perfectly reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. I'm glad I decided to come back in.  T9day was a total 5 star experience. I hope the bar staff today receives the acknowledgement they deserve for such great service."
2314,"This is the restaurant in the Portland Westin Harborview, and  we had breakfast there during a stay.  It's a clean minimal space, maybe a little ""hotel restaurant""-ish, but still quite nice.

I had the excellent ""Rustic Hash"". Being a corned beef hash aficionado, i have to say this is among the better versions I've had as far as ingredients - the corned beef was big chunks of corned beef, along with potato and some onion, with a couple over easy eggs, and i asked for English muffin on the side. Everything was cooked well, though  the hash could have been crispier and more charred (but that's a personal taste thing) and overall it needed seasoning, but better under- than over-seasoned.
My partner had blueberry Yogurt pancakes and said they were delicious
We loved the awesome china and flatware. and for a hotel restaurant, the prices were reasonable. 

The service was friendly and prompt."
2315,"Came here late night for some dessert and wine.  I ordered a pumpkin cheesecake for dessert.  When it came I had no idea they put the chew cake itself in a small cup.  I understand they are trying to be fancy, stylish, and invent a new concept,  but man the cheesecake was hard to eat in a small cup with the big spoon they gave me.  I had to apply a lot of pressure with my spoon to drill through the bottom layer crust of the cheesecake in the small cup.  The taste and flavor was good though which is why I'm giving this review a three star instead of two stars."
2316,"I had breakfast here, and it was pretty good. The prices were too high, and the food was a little bland. I ordered corned beef hash with two eggs over-hard and gluten-free bread. The hash was attractive with red peppers, onion, and home-fried potatoes mixed in with a generous portion of fresh corned beef, but it lacked flavor. The eggs were perfect, though, and I appreciated the gluten-free bread. 

The atmosphere is a bit pretentious, though I liked sitting by the window, looking out at the busy sidewalk. 

I don't plan to go back, but it's not a bad place overall."
2317,"My group came here one night for dinner during my bachelorette party and had a great experience. Highly recommend the private room for a larger group (we had 8). Our server was very attentive and polite, and I was impressed by both the service and food after reading some of the more negative reviews."
2318,Wonderful Mother's Day brunch! The food was fresh & flavorful with a nice variety of items to satisfy my family of 6. Dessert table that had more than we could ever want and from a local bakery:) Everything was so beautifully prepared and delicious and the staff were happy and accommodating. My whole family really enjoyed themselves. Thank you C2
2319,"A Mother's Day letdown. We had a reservation for 8:15. Several people were standing at the door, waiting to be seated. This took more than 5 minutes. One waitress was working the entire room, which was filling quickly. It took a long time to get our order in and even longer for the food to arrive. A family with small children waited one hour for their food. It wasn't until 8:55 until we were finally eating. The food was OK. What a serious disappointment: a Mother's Day much anticipated breakfast ruined by terrible service . Never coming back."
2320,"I'm not sure where to start. The service was absolutely atrocious and I'm being kind. The food was greasy, tasteless bar food. The view is the only redeeming factor it never fails. Have a glass of wine and mosey on for food!"
2321,"They do not have a happy hour any longer, despite half the reviews on here being about happy hour. Upon arriving it was incredibly empty and even with that two people behind the bar ignored us until we talked to them. Then, when I asked about happy hour they told me they never had one  um excuse me don't lie. I never ever give bad reviews so you can take it to heart when I say, just don't eat here. The staff was not polite, made me go find the menu to just see that it was overpriced basic food. They never even talked to me again so I left. The food those at the bar had out didn't look like anything special and there are a huge amount of places in the area where people are friendly and the food is more affordable where you would be supporting local business. Do not go here unless you don't have another option."
2322,"I have to give a five star to the service, people there were amazing. We went with a 2 year extremely active kid and we had a hard time everywhere we went, except this one.
The beer was in the perfect temperature and the bread with the herbs spread delightful! 
I ordered steamed Maine mussels with herbs fries and they were to die for! 
Don't waste your time going to the commercial Street places where you will have to wait for at least 30 minutes to be seated and 40 more to get the food! 
If I come back in town definitively I will come back here!"
2323,"Went here with my family. Took a look at the menu and didn't see any vegan options. However, the staff was extremely accommodating and checked with the chef about what they could do. Ended up with a delicious vegan dinner of quinoa and lots of vegetables just for me! Great meal and experience!"
2324,"This is a great place for a night out.  I really love this restaurant.  True, it's in a hotel and the room is large, but it really does feel like a high end place.  It was not crowded this last time, but we have gone (for Thanksgiving last year) and it was full.  Basically with so many options in Portland, you have to stand out and this place does so by being convenient in location but also with their service and food.  And wine selection.  Some really great bottles can be had here and their wine rack/display is worth a trip in itself.  

We all got the prix fixe menu that night, where you got 4 courses plus dessert.  Standouts were the mac n cheese, the brie, the burger, and the desserts.  Our server was attentive and had some good suggestions.  For us, this place is only a few blocks from home, so it is a great place for dinner or drinks.  We've gone for happy hour drinks and food and the value is definitely worth it."
2325,"Bright, clean, beautiful space. Excellent service and food.

Tonight for dinner we enjoyed:
Fresh baguette with herb ricotta cheese
Heirloom tomato with Burrata -Amazing
Burger with bacon jam - so good
Vegetarian risotto - creamy and hearty
Side of smoked Gouda Mac and cheese

Yum."
2326,"With exceptional service and attention to detail, C Squared kicked off my day perfectly with a delicious brunch. After staying at the Westin the night before, it was convenient to have breakfast right in the hotel the next morning. 

I had a cappuccino and bagel with lox and cream cheese. I was also able to try the yummy strawberry smoothie. Everything was delicious. There was no shortage of coffee or water the entire time, and the wait staff constantly checked up on us. 

Would love to come back here for HH if ever in Portland again!"
2327,"First time I have eaten inside as the weather has gotten colder, absolutely beautiful setting!  The atmosphere was quiet and and relaxed, even with several events going on in at the hotel.  The food was fantastic, I had the ancho-crusted yellowfin tuna and it was cooked perfectly!  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  She had recommendations for pairings and was very attentive.  My dining companion and I were thrilled with the food, atmosphere, and service!  Thank you Congress Squared!"
2328,"Ok, I loved our waitress. What a great gal. Loves her job, super friendly not phony. Great Customer service from CHLOE!!
We had the price fixed dinner for Christmas. We had marvelous soup. Mushroom for hubby and acorn squash for me. Then I had scallops, he had Cornish Game Hen. The bread was super yummy with salted maple butter.
OK, the cornish game hen. ....on the menu it states
WHOLE ROASTED CORNISH GAME HEN. 
What does that mean? It means A WHOLE CORNISH GAME HEN. What did hubby get A HALF OF A CORNISH GAME HEN? What was explained? 
IT MEANS THE CORNISH GAME HEN IS ROASTED WHOLE. Chloe said when she spoke with the chef. He said he was wondering when someone would figure that out. We did. 
What did we get....we got a whole meal, to go. So we got to eat it the next day. 
We even got more veggies to go with it. PLUS, we got cookies and a nice smile from Chloe. 
OH yes and I had a cocktail. A Nelson Mule. Quite Tasty. Thanks!"
2329,"Had dinner here last night . Monkfish was delicious! Spenser was the barman and my server. 
Excellent food. Exceptional service. Here again today for a late lunch. Aaron is my server. He is attentive but not overbearing.
The chef should be commended! Excellent cuisine! A bit pricey but with every penny. Love this Westin hotel too! Watch for my Yelp review after checking out tomorrow."
2330,"Writing this from the Great Happy Hour bandwagon. First awesome thing about it: there's a menu online. Seriously. You can go look at it on their website right now, it even has hours!! I'm not sure why happy hours are supposed to be so secretive, but of all the great happy hours in town that involve food, it seems like none really publish a menu. Go check it out, Maine Mussels - $7 and they're pretty huge, Sirloin Steak Burger w/fries - $9. We had those exact two things and both were fantastic. Had the burger medium, and lo and behold it was actually what I consider medium, which is probably closer to medium rare for most. Two ladies came in that seemed to be happy hour regulars and also split the burger and had the Gouda Mac, which also sounds great. They even gave us bread and butter even though we were clearly not there breaking the bank.

One thing that's kind of annoying, but probably too late to fix, is that there is no draft beer (probably is at the Top of the East though), so all beer is bottled. $4.00 for almost all of them and they are locals like Baxter IPA, Sebago Frye's Leap, Atlantic Coal Porter, etc. Not an amazing deal, not terrible either, $5.00 wine was okay. The tea though, $5.00!! For Tazo! It allowed me to make fun of my date for having a more expensive tea than my beer, but still, that's a bit crazy.

We sat at the bar (maybe you have to?), and the girls working back there were super nice, fun to talk to and made us feel right at home. We were here at about 5:30 on a Monday so totally dead, but take advantage of this while you can before the touristas descend on Portland for the spring, summer and fall. $13.00 for a beer and a sirloin steak burger with fries is just insane and worth every penny."
2331,"Another vote for the happy hour. It really is as good as it can get. I have been there twice and it seems like the happy hour menu did not change at all (Well, why would they? The menu is so good to start with already). I would recommend to come here with a big group of friends, order everything on the happy hour menu and figure out which one is the best to order next. Don't dress too casual though because you will feel out of place. There are a lot of business people in town and dine here."
2332,"The food was tasty but it was served barely lukewarm. I sent my plate back and the server brought back a new dinner and was equally lukewarm. It appeared the kitchen was across a hallway and a couple of doors away from the dining area and plates were carried uncovered. We won't be back, too expensive for lukewarm meals."
2333,"I expect new restaurant to have a few bugs to work out and aside from their side door opening to the street and letting all the frigid air in, the food and service was really good.
Try scallops and salmon, crab cakes and charcuterie board, nice selection of wine by the glass or beers."
2334,"tl;dr: I don't like to complain, BUT overpriced, underwhelming & cold food, crappy service, invisible staff and management. Toast was ok, though. 

I need to preface this review by saying that I rarely complain at or about restaurants - even when things aren't the best, or service is spotty, I chalk it up to someone having a bad day and just shrug it off. 

We read a few negative reviews about this place before we went - and we really should have listened. We were attracted to this restaurant because they offer a breakfast buffet every day, and as it was our last morning in Portland, we wanted to have a long leisurely breakfast. Unfortunately, the only reason our breakfast turned out to be long was because, despite an almost empty dining room, we didn't see much of our server or other staff. Every time we returned back to our table from the buffet, nobody on the staff had come by to remove our used plates, and as a result we experienced a small pile up of plates (on a two-top table, this presents a spatial problem). Our water glasses were filled once when we were seated, and then not again for a very long time. Normally, I would dismiss this inattentiveness and accept that the restaurant was busy, but with only three other parties in the dining room, I don't understand it. 

Considering the small size of the buffet and the quality of the options provided, the buffet was quite pricey - $22pp for assorted pastries, toast, scrambled eggs & mini quiches, potatoes, oatmeal, boxed cereals, sausage and bacon (no pancake/French toast option). The eggs were bland, the bacon tasted slightly off, and the quiches were ice cold (cold eggs..eek). The only things I wound up eating were danishes and toast. When I expressed to our server that the quiches were cold, she apologized and returned with four new quiches ""from the warmer"" (also cold, and as they were from the ""warmer,"" they likely had been sitting around a bit). Note, our reservation was for 8:15 and breakfast runs at this restaurant until the early afternoon, so I'm not sure how often they refresh their buffet stations, but it probably should be more frequently. 

Once we finally settled our bill, we attempted to find the manger of the restaurant to discuss our experience, but the front of the restaurant was completely empty. As the restaurant is in the Westin Hotel, we walked over to the front desk to see if someone there could help us find the restaurant manager. The clerk, who was very apologetic, tried to call the restaurant (no answer) and page the manager on the walkie-talkie (also no answer). Finally, she was able to reach someone, who informed her that the restaurant manager (along with all of the other managers) was in a meeting and would be back in ten minutes, if we wouldn't mind waiting. We waited for ten minutes, as we were asked to do. However, as we had to be down at the wharf for a boat tour shortly thereafter, we could not wait any longer, so we left. And we will never be back."
2335,"This is a review for their fantastic happy hour. I believe this may be one of the best happy hours in portland! Not only is it half off the entire bar food menu, $4 beers, $5 wine of the day, $6 cocktail of the day, but it's also from 4p-7p EVERYDAY. For those of us that work late, getting to a happy hour in P-town is a bit of an ordeal. For this happy hour, you'll make it. It might be a Sunday, but you made it, right? The bar food menu is not your typical wings, tapas, small plates either. It's full-sized burgers, pizzas, lobster sliders, mac and cheese and other deliciousness that I have yet to try. Yes, it's at the Westin. Yes, there are cooler places to hangout during happy hour. But, like I said, It's good food and drinks at a steal and at a reasonable time."
2336,"After 30 or 4 calls for a reservation for ten (at 7 on a Saturday night during the holidays) we gave up.  We accepted the inevitable choices of an impromptu takeaway in a friends kitchen or our hotel restaurant. 
Shocker. 
The food and service were excellent. The atmosphere was quiet. We had the place to our selves for four hours. 
I am a fan of c2."
2337,"The service here is horrible. We came for Happy Hour and were only one of two parties at the bar. It took so long for the bartender to take our order I changed my original order of a Manhattan to a glass of wine because I was worried it would take 20 min to get the drink back. After 10 minutes I got my wine, but my boyfriend's beer never came. Our happy hour food came out 45 minutes later --- clearly having been left under the heat lamp for a little too long. Our lobster slider was warm in all the wrong ways. We had to request drinks by flagging down a server as they walked by, no one ever initiated. The wait staff was also complaining about being busy and other servers in the hotel right in front of us. It's a beautiful place, too bad they can't get their service together."
2338,"C2 now has shorter HH times and a very limited HH menu. The happy hour is now from 3-6pm. There are only three items offered on the HH food menu for $6: Gouda mac and cheese, scorched brie plate, and burger (fries extra $4). Maine beers increased from $4 to $5. On the plus side, they have several wines available at $5 a glass."
2339,We decided to check out this place before a show at the State.  The outside seating area was great especially with the live music at the square.  The service was friendly and efficient. We had burgers with some amazing fries.  I recommend people to check it out especially on a concert night.
2340,"Stayed at the Westin Hotel and got breakfast from C2 two days in a row and it was horrible. Burnt toast, dry hasbrowns, over cooked eggs, and a pathetic excuse of corn beef hash. Avoid this place for breakfast at all cost."
2341,"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to.  The best Eggs Benedict, topped with lobster, for breakfast.  We came back for dinner for dinner knowing we would not be disappointed.  And we were right!  Everything was amazing, including the service.  And, they're open late. Bravo!"
2342,"I began the evening with Maine Clam Chowder, which was decadent with clams, applewood bacon and red potatoes in every bite.  My main course was the Pan Seared Duck Breast with a gratin of celeriac, parsnips & sweet potato so thinly sliced you could almost see through them.  The gratin was delicious and set of by a warm kale salad.  The plate was perfectly plated with three drops of a fig balsamic which was a perfect sauce for the duck.  Finished with a Brown Butter Pear Crisp, which is homemade in house with vanilla bean gelato. How more perfect could the dinner experience be?  Attentive and friendly staff to boot!"
2343,"We just had a poor experience with this restaurant.  It was a rainy Saturday night and the place was empty.  We had a waitress that started out ok.  We made it to the point where we ordered  espresso and my dessert that was part of the tasting menu.  She gave my husband his espresso and never came back.  Ever.  A big party had come in and she preceded to walk by us ignoring us completely for about 25 minutes. She never brought dessert or the check.  My husband had to walk through the restaurant to get the attention of another waitress who gave us my dessert about 10 minutes after that.  Thanks, but No thanks.  I left my food and untouched dessert on the table.  Meanwhile our waitress kept walking by still ignoring us.  Never before have I done this, but zero tip for you."
2344,"I forgot that the Westin is quite a nice hotel chain, so I should have expected this restaurant be of a high quality. It is set up as a long rectangle, starting with the bar area as you enter that overflows into the dining room. All fixtures seem new and are very clean. The staff is friendly. The happy hour is wonderful, save for the short list of options (perhaps they rotate the selection?). The steak burger is great but the accompanying truffle fries could have used a little more seasoning. The drinks were a little watery, but creative. The gratis bread and dip to start brings this place back up to 5 stars."
2345,"We are Portland locals and had dinner here for our anniversary earlier this month. While it is pricy to eat and drink here, everything is excellent quality and worth the splurge for a special occasion. The staff at C2 have been lovely both times we have been there - kind, attentive but not overbearing, and knowledgeable. The restaurant was good about accommodating about menu adjustments (letting me me switch out greens for asparagus, respecting requests about food allergies, etc). I look forward to having an excuse to go back for a treat!"
2346,"I never give bad reviews, but my experience at happy hour was truly disappointing. First, the bar tender did not even offer happy hour menus. We were not aware of the happy hour drink specials -- that we certainly would have taken advantage of -- until we asked another employee for a menu to look at food options (note that the bar tender was not around for us to ask her). This felt like a sneaky move by the bartender. It didn't benefit her in the end because the terrible service led to a small tip. Overall, the atmosphere was pretentious. There was some sort of event going on in the restaurant and it was clear that the ""regular"" customers were a much lower priority. The appetizers were fine -- but not good enough to give me any reason to return in light of the terrible service and overall rudeness we experienced."
2347,"Average, underwhelming lunch. Very limited options. Also not particularly good value. Great ambiance and service. Food was OK. Would not go back again. Many better options elsewhere."
2348,"Ate right at the bar and it was perfect. The atmosphere is really nice, drinks are great, and the food was so tasty. They also gave us pretty large portions so an app and the burger was enough for my boyfriend and I to split!"
2349,"Had 20th anniversary dinner celebration here. Was told by lady taking reservation that ""special window table"" would be reserved and that they would make the occasion ""one to remember."" Arrived and hostess confirmed reservation, then told server to seat us ""anywhere."" When I reminded her of reservation plans, she said the ""special window table"" had been reserved for someone else, so we ended up sitting in bar area.  Nothing else acknowledging occasion for the rest of the night. So much for promises and service. Food was okay, but overpriced for what we got. At least the wine was good.... Overall, very disappointing."
2350,Went there for the first time for our 17th wedding anniversary.  What a pleasant surprise.  My wife had the Poutine and I had the burger...DELICIOUS!  Our waitresses Jessica was great too.  We ate around 5pm and had the place all to ourselves which was nice.  This has gotta be one o' Portland's best kept secrets!
2351,"We went for happy hour one evening.  It's so clean and chic.  The staff were all courteous and friendly.  They have half priced food and select drinks from 4-7p.  It was well worth it.  I loved the lobster sliders!  My husband had the mac-n-cheese, which was very good as well.  I would definitely go back."
2352,We arrived late at the Westin and really didn't want to venture out for dinner and thought we would try the restaurant in the hotel.  The food was fantastic and the presentation was stunning. Highly recommend!
2353,This place ROCKS! I went with a friend and we enjoyed a nice bottle of white for half price! We tried several of the small plates including the serrano ham and everything was delicious! I especially loved the crispy cheese croquettes and the heirloom carrots. YUM! the service was good as well. I will DEF be going back!
2354,"Fantastic food and service at the bar last night.  The two bartenders working really know how to take care of people, they were very pleasant, attentive and went way out of their way to make a kitchen error right.  The burger tasted great, had very high quality ingredients and was easy to eat.  I will be back for the happy hour for sure.  Thank you for converting us into (god willing) regular customers!"
2355,We enjoyed 50% off the bar menu during happy hour until 7 PM.  The sirloin burger was delicious.   However my son did not like the whole wheat pasta.  Really good bread.  A nice selection of wines by the glass.
2356,"I have been here several times during the Holiday season and I have to say that this restaurant hits every nail on the head. The atmosphere and ambiance are inviting and casual whilst maintaining a clean and classy vibe. The wait staff are all very knowledgeable, professional, and genuinely friendly with no feeling of a pretentious facade. And then there is the food; I have eaten almost every item on the menu and I have to say that I am truly impressed by the quality of ingredients, the skill of cooking every item just perfectly to reflect the maximum potential of each dish, and the creativity of pairing ingredients and the way that they are to be cooked is quite sophisticated yet comfortable and easy to appreciate for any palate. Try the caramelized heirloom carrots- they are AMAZING and to prove it, I went with my friend who doesn't like carrots and she tried them reluctantly and LOVED them."
2357,"Had a really good dinner here. The field greens salad is amazing, main courses are small portions but very filling. The vanilla creme brûlée is outstanding!"
2358,"Tonight's dinner with (my) Chris, Sue, Sara, & (Sara's) Chris was great fun! The food was fantastic and the conversation was even better! Sara & (her) Chris enjoyed the beer selection from the Maine Beer Company. For dinner, I chose Orecchiette Mac n' cheese w/ pancetta...& it was amazing! Sara, Sue, & (Sara's) Chris all ordered the mile-high sirloin steak burger with crispy onions. They were all made perfectly. Sue was super happy our server remembered to bring her ""side of mayo"". (My) Chris was pleased with His lobster sliders, homemade chips, & clam chowder. We all shared grilled flatbread, and a cheese platter with figs and drizzled honey.  We definitely recommend this restaurant. :D"
2359,"Had breakfast here when the line was too long at the diner around the corner. And it was really good! Service was excellent, prices were high but consistent with the level of service and quality of the food."
2360,"Ate breakfast while guests in the hotel.  Ordered the eggs and ham for one and an omelet for the other.  Everything was definitely fresh, prepared to our liking and served with a smile!  Wish we had time to try it out for other meals...but glad to have tried it for breakfast."
2361,"Inedible. Food was too salty that my wife spit it out. My 4 year old son said the chicken tasted off (his fav food). The experience was so bad, they sent us with new entrees home for free and even those were not well prepared."
2362,"Just got in from a flight, decided to eat in at the restaurant at the hotel. Glad I did.
I started with a local IPA beer on draught, perfect start. For dinner I had the surf & turf, which was steak and shrimp, mashed potatoes and broccoli, served on a platter style plate. It was a lot of food, I came close to finishing it. The large steak was cooked perfectly, very filling and delicious.
Overall, great dinner. And the waitress, with her continual friendly smile, was an added bonus to the experience."
2363,"Has been our ""out of the fray"" favorite spot for almost 2 years.  They have some evening live entertainment that is good but the food and mixed drinks specials keep us coming back.   Oh and the Sunday brunch is amazing.  The have the best bacon I have ever had.  Pricing is perfect   Great views of the harbor from the deck.   It's definitely a local secret."
2364,"I've been to the Snow Squall *many* times over the last few decades. Generally, it's been good, but frankly the last several visits have been less than great, for a couple reasons. 
Oddly enough, I visited twice in two days, (neither my choice) with other visits a year or more ago. 
On Thursday, November 1st, my companion and I went for lunch, chosing the location due to proximal convenience. From what either of us could tell, the menu is the same for lunch as it is for dinner. I opted for the salmon salad, which was tasty ... the salmon was perfectly done! However, service was slow and then we had a change in staff was the first was leaving for the shift/day. Overall, a decent experience. 
The next occasion, Saturday, November 3rd (my companions choice) was for dinner to hear live music and one of my companions had never been there. 
The experience was disappointing overall. Service was okay, yet I had to ask the wait person twice about a couple of items and if they were gluten free or not. (She forgot to ask the first time.) She asked us if we would like rolls and my friends said yes, she asked me ""would you like a roll? gf of course."" We were brought the rolls and appetizers in close order...I had to ask three staff for extra butter four times (1,1,2).  Then dinner came. I ordered a bowl of jambalaya and was very disappointed with it. It was nothing special and actually reminded me of spaghetti o's with vegetable soup thrown in. Having ordered the bowl (which is shallow) it seemed to be about the same quantity or just a bit more, as the (huge!) cups of soup that are offered (my friends ordered cups as an app). For twice the price, that was disappointing. For a bowl of jambalaya, there were 3 dime/penny sized, 1/5"" pieces of sausage ... and the same amount of chicken, celery, onion, and bits of red peppers or tomato (?), bits of sweet potato and something kind of hard (carrots?) TONS of rice, very dense. It needed salt and was very bland...no spiciness whatsoever. 
NOTE: When the bill arrived, I'd been charged $3 for a gf roll. It was offered as though it was complimentary, like the others are. When brought to the servers attention, I felt guilty for asking for it to be taken off my bill. ""I'll have to pay for that."" After she asked management (?) it was brought down to $2. NO...if you offer a roll to me as complimentary and don't tell me there's a significant upcharge, so I can opt out of the purchase, that is not my responsibility. It's the restaurants responsibility, as not all  establishments charge extra for gf substitutions. I still tipped fairly, although it wasn't as much as I would normally leave.

The glass of wine was very good. The music was good. The ambiance was fair. The food was disappointing. The service was disappointing. Will I return? With the amazing dining options in greater Portland, probably not. At least not anytime soon."
2365,"Decent happy hour/pub menu! This is a great little hole in the wall tucked in the Knightville neighborhood, down by where the million dollar bridge used to be. They offer up a creative cocktail list, local brews and tasty apps. It used to be my favorite neighborhood haunt when I lived in the neighborhood. My husband loves the jambalaya and I am a huge fan of their wings and salad. Overall, I have never had a bad meal or cocktail here. The atmosphere is comfy cozy in the bar with overstuffed chairs and couches, along with a few high tops and a traditional bar. It is a low key casual first date spot or quiet place to catch up with your friends in the afternoon. All the bartenders are extremely friendly, helpful and will take time to explain the different local beers on tap and the ingredients in their cocktails. Well worth the stop in if you are passing by."
2366,"We're bar people. It's just more fun for some reason when you're jammed next to strangers, well, at least when alcohol is involved. Plus you get to usually banter a bit with the staff, and there's typically the added bonus of not being next to screaming children. We're apparently not alone in this because when we drive around SoPo looking for drinks and sustenance, places get packed at the bar. 

So, one fateful evening, Elsmere bar packed, Foulmouthed bar packed, even the damn Bridgeway, yes, the Bridgeway bar packed. Then by some random occurrence, we remember the Snow Squall. I had been here once in the past 5 years, and had weird memories of it when I was in high school. It was busy, but there was room at the bar, we made some friends, ate some great food. Fast forward to present day and we've been here probably close to a dozen times in the past year.

The food is always great, and listen to me when I say if you're searching for a good turkey burger, look no farther. There's crack in it. I've thought about working here for a day to steal the recipe, I don't know how they do it. The wings are very good, salads maybe a little hit or miss, we had one with rubber chicken. Brunch is pretty great though I had a similar experience where the bacon was clearly cooked a while back and barely reheated. I would love a just slightly upgraded beer selection with a local like Austin Street Patina, the Bissell Substance, a Rising Tide of some kind, but I understand those are likely more expensive than say the All-Day IPA from Founders. Good happy hour specials, though the well for well drinks is WELL. 

The staff here is wonderful and have a good sense of humor even in the most chaotic of days, and there are two bars, so that just doubles your chances if you're bar people like us and are looking for a different option."
2367,"Last time we went they were closed unfortunately (they are not open on Monday and Tuesday). But other times we have been and had a great time and enjoyed some delicious food.

We're really fond of the housemade chips and dip appetizer, of all things. Also recommend the salmon wrap and sweet potato fries, but honestly the entire menu looks mouthwatering and we look forward to our next visit!"
2368,"Overall impression: meh. Our meals were pretty close to an average home cooked meal and the service was slow on a slow night. Maybe we just got unlucky, it is 4 star rated after all, but my guess is that this place has a loyal local following and gets high stars just for being a little more normal than your tastier Portland options. Also, an almost non-existent selection of local beers so if your want to try local brews, steer your ship away from here. We'd like to give it another try but in a town with so many restaurant options it's just to hard to justify it."
2369,"Snow Squall has redeemed itself, I'm happy to say.  We went yesterday in between lunch & dinner around 3:30.  We had the place to ourselves, which was odd, but the food was delicious.  I got the Warm Apple & Pear Salad it was sautéed apples and pears with baked sweet potato wedges, dried cranberries and candied walnuts over baby spinach with an asian vinaigrette, I added salmon and it was cooked perfectly & very tasty.  The whole salad was full of fresh flavor & the walnuts added a nice crunch.  I recommend this salad."
2370,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 11.  The food was well prepared and very tasty.  I had the Angus burger with cheddar and bacon.  The onion rings were crispy and not at all greasy.

The waitress split the checks for us even though the policy stated no splits over 6 people."
2371,"Excellent food! Scratch made everything! The Buttermilk Fried Chicken is so good.... Monkfish with lobster gnocchi was out of this world as was the chicken wrap and huge steak! Medium rare as ordered (which barely ever happens) the calamari was perfectly cooked, light and crispy and the crab cakes were the best I've ever had. All in all... 10/10."
2372,"We discovered the Snow Squall last spring. We've been back at least a dozen times, or more....
The food here is consistently good, as is the service.  The wait staff really seem to support each other.
We LOVE the fact that there are many, many different choices on the menu.  The Bistro menu is our favorite.  
There is always a big selection of specials on the board to choose from.
We've been here for brunch a few times as well.  The superb Bloody s make Sundays easier to face Mondays.
We've brought our grandkids here several times as they too love coming here and are always welcomed."
2373,I wish I could give this less than 1 star. This is probably the worst meal I have ever had. There were 8 people in our group with similar results. I figured ordering the mussels with Caesar salad was a safe bet but boy was I wrong. The Caesar salad had no dressing. It tasted like they just mixed it with corn oil. I couldn't eat it. The mussels were not much better. Half of them were unopened so I didn't eat them and the rest were over cooked. I would have sent them back but the service was worse than the food. I eat out a lot and how this place could be rated an average of 4 stars is beyond me. If you want good food go to someplace in Portland instead
2374,"Food was fantastic. Live entertainment was actually very good, the duo was loud enough to be heard, but did not rattle the windows. Very pleasant place and our waitress was the best ever. Highly recommend to everyone."
2375,Excellent food and great atmosphere. Had the shrimp and scallops over succatash which was delicious.
2376,"How can you not appreciate a place that has a Cheap Eats menu where not only is the food $10 and under... there's a lot of it and it's darn good, too?

To begin with, I came here with a large group, and making the reservation couldn't have been easier. They were abundantly accommodating from the moment I called to make the reso to the moment we paid our bills and left the restaurant. There was an abundance of parking and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive - probably some of the best service I've had.  I can't believe we had one server for twelve people... and she never missed a beat (even making sure to let the chefs know each of our dietary restrictions)!

Drink:
+/- Rosemary Grapefruit Mule, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with vodka, ginger beer, and rosemary, $9: This was a really solid mule and I would order it again, however I don't think it tasted anything like grapefruit (and that was the ingredient that inspired me to order this). 

Food:
+ Nachos with roasted veggies, $12: I wasn't expecting these nachos to be good, but... damn. They were. And I'm annoyed that I had to share with people. Fried flour nachos topped with red peppers, tomatoes, cheese, and scallions with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.  
+ Eggplant Napoleon, panko encrusted eggplant stacked with fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes, $10: This was everything I was hoping it was going to be. Thick layers of perfectly fried eggplant, creamy mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes. It tumbled to it's side when it arrived at our table, but that didn't make it any less yummy. Stick to your ribs vegetarian fare that's good for winter days? Yes, please! I will think about this dish in the cold months to come.
+/- ""Yummy Dumplings"", veggie potstickers with wasabi mustard dipping sauce, $10: I can't believe how many there were in this serving! They were good... definitely stuffed full of beautiful green vegetables... but a little greasy.
- Warm Pretzels, $5: This was a mistake. Flavorless, cold pretzel sticks. Just get a second order of the eggplant napoleon and thank me later.

The only thing I wasn't sold on here was the atmosphere. It was a little underwhelming, though I dug the fireplace we got to sit next to. I also dug the elderly woman who let us know she was so happy to hear our table laughing so much - that it brought life to her evening. Warm fuzzies! Full bellies! And my budget isn't busted!"
2377,"This was a fabulous new find and I wish it was closer to home because everything is sooo good. They not only have a spectacular menu filled with filling savory entrees, a board of delectable desserts, a list of specialty cocktails but an everchanging specials board of spectular delights. The staff were attentive, smiling, fun, engaging and a wealth of information about the menu. No cup was empty for more than a moment and no belly left without being stuffed. The prices are perfect for the large portions and high quality eats. The setting was a lovely harbor, right next to a yacht club. There were patrons of all sorts and all friendly and smiling. This place was quite busy for a weelday evening and they kept up with the flow. 

The nachos were some of the best I have ever had, fluffy crisp flour crisps with cubes of buffalo chicken and loads of melty cheese served with fresh salsa, creamy guac and smmoth sour cream. The carnivore in me hesitated to order veggie potsticker but my taste buds couldn't deny the down right awesome taste of these fried morsels with a wonderful soy dipping sauce. By the time all the apps were devoured I could hardly fit another bite. Then my sausage cavappati dish arrived with tender italian sausage, sundried tomatoes, shaved parmesan, portabella mushroom slices all coated in a delicous creamy marsala sauce that was amazingly divine. I had to take most home with me. but it was still good on day 2. Them came the tollhouse cookie pie. A sweet and slightly salty treat that satified my sweet tooth. It was soft and not too rich but was such a wonderful treat.

I cannot wait to come back and try even more of their mouth watering food. I may have even had some cheesy dreams after all this goodness"
2378,"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night in the middle of a winter storm (a snow squall, if you will) and what a warm and inviting atmosphere it was. We started with some of the signature cocktails from the bar--very impressive--and the Maine mussels, which were delicious. I don't even like mussels that much, but I ate the crap out of these ones. The dish came with these really yummy breadsticks to dip in the broth, which was an added flavor bonus. For my entree, I had the pasta special that evening, which was a seafood pappardelle that was off-tha-chain: wide homemade noodles with big chunks of seafood in a flavorful sauce. My husband had the lamb with potatoes and he said it was pretty good. But those mussels... Would definitely recommend this place."
2379,"The Snow Squall is the Toyota Camry of local restaurants. Everything about it is really good and reliable, but it will never ""Wow"" you with flashiness.

Twelve of us arrived on a winter Wednesday with few expectations. The restaurant is attractive but maybe a little plain. It's so close to the ocean in South Portland but (from what I could tell) has no water views. Our server was incredible. All night she displayed impeccable timing with drink refills and orders. I can't think of better service anywhere in recent memory.

The cocktail menu is creative and the $9-$10 price point yields value. I was excited for the Rosemary-Grapefruit Mule but left mildly disappointed. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't exceptional. The Gunpowder Old Fashioned with local Whiskey, blood orange bitters and simple syrup was much better.

The nachos were surprisingly maybe my favorite in Portland. The secret was flour tortillas instead of corn, and they were housemade. With buffalo chicken and cheese generously slathered, I literally could not stop eating them. The ""Yummy"" dumplings were veggie potstickers with a wasabi mustard sauce. They were decent, and the portion of eight was huge, but I would have preferred a pork version. The 7 ounce burger, a steal at $9, was a really solid burger. 

The menu is extensive with cheap eats, bistro fare, entrees, salads/soups and apps in a variety of price points. Everything that appeared from the kitchen looked delicious, and I'm eager to return."
2380,"Arrived and our table was a set and ready. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. We had nachos for an app which were very good.Just the right amount of  topping and were served with sour cream and guacamole. I ordered the seafood risotto which was very nice , but a little too cheesy. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Service was good as I know its not easy with a large group, but the timing of everything was great. Great selection of wine. I had the sauvignon  blanc which was crisp and with hints of citrus. I'd recommend to friends and go back myself!"
2381,"Cool cozy down to earth neighborhood place to get your grub on. Can't believe it took me this long to enjoy this place. Chicken BLT wrap is amazing and so are the sweet potatoes fries. 

Service is outstandingly and the seating areas are differently cool. They have traditional 2 and 4 tops, bar seating and a super cozy lounge area. Big chairs with a warm fire and a cocktails, yes please! 

If you are in South Portland check you need to check it out. If you are in Portland you should make the trip over the bridge. While your here soak in the amazing view of Portland."
2382,"I Went here with some friends to celebrate the holidays.  The service was excellent.  The fire was warm and toasty.  I shared the lobster sliders - so yummy!!  The roll was toaster and worked perfectly with the lobster.
Nice place to get to see friends from the area!"
2383,"The service was friendly and the deck was quite full, so we sat inside in a booth.

We started with the house made chips appetizer. This bowl was so big, it could have been a meal! Honestly, my husband and I would have been AOK with that. They were crunchy, not over salted, almost airy, and a perfect thickness for the accompanying dips. We had to bring half home to my dad to insure room for the actual meal.

My husband said how much he enjoyed the salmon wrap and I tried the sweet potato fries where were quite yummy.

I had the seafood special of the day. I was told it's ""chef's whim"" as to what goes in and that day was lobster, haddock, and shrimp over penne. I have to confess, I lived in Maine 22 years and never had lobster.

I know, I know....I KNOW!!

I confess my shame at waiting so long. This was delicious. Rich, but not heavy. Filling, because of the generous portion. There was trully an equal amount of quality fresh seafood as there was pasta. I once again gave dad my leftovers. He had them a day or so after we left and could not stop raving over how awesome it was! (That's two days in the fridge later, mind you!) 

The prices were a tad higher on first blush, but having now enjoyed the quality, it is well justified. Next visit, if it's warm enough, we will sit outside on the patio."
2384,"Made a reservation for 7:45 on a Thursday night. We were told that our table wasn't ready which was perfectly okay, we had a drink at the lounge area. What we expected to be a fun night out turned into a nightmare; we ended up having to wait over an hour for the table we had a reservation for. Not once did the staff or management come over to check up or give us a status on our table. Once we were finally seated an hour and a half later, when we mentioned to our waiter the wait we had, she blamed us for not being willing to sit at a 4 person table as a 6 person group. This restaurant had the ambiance and menu we were looking forward to. Unfortunately their management and ownership forced us to walk out and grab food at a local brewery. I have never encountered a restaurant with such bad customer service. I never review or criticize restaurant, but felt obligated to make a yelp review after this experience."
2385,"Solid 4 star restaurant near the marina in S. Portland.

Our table had crab encrusted haddock and the 1/2 chicken. Both were very good

Another +1 is that although we arrived during the lunch/bistro menu they gladly offered up the dinner menu so we ordered from it.

Will return next time we're nearby."
2386,"I've eaten here off and  on for years (off was some company function an on was friends throwing a party for some reason, but never showed up just for a meal. I'm kicking myself after having dinner the other night. It was a wretchedly hot day and the shrimp scampi salad with veggie potstickers was terrific. My daughter ordered the steak and it was as good as steak gets. Live music was good. Another menu to work through."
2387,"Excellent food and open ambiance.  The salad with steak was on point, but the chowder was my favorite. Very kind people."
2388,"What can I say about a really great place with a excellent staff & proprietor... Heather runs a amazing bar & restaurant,hangout.. It's So nice not to travel far without having to go across the bridge... Calamari is by far the best in Cumberland county.. Music is good & simplistic , Antony f should have went to taco trio maybe.. But the staff are doing a top class job , so thank you keep up the great amazing work you's do... Noel"
2389,"Came here with a large group tonight and could not be happier. The food, the service and atmosphere was all awesome. We ordered nachos and dumplings to start. The buffalo chicken nachos were probably in my top ten nachos. The dumplings were served very hot and very tasty.  

For dinner I wanted to order the special, bbq pork sliders. The issue was they were out of the buns. The waitress who was very helpful gave me the idea of turning it into a quesadilla. This idea was the best of the night. Very very good. All the food that came out of the kitchen looked amazing and I wish I could have tried more items. 

I was so full I couldn't even fathom eating dessert but I could fathom ordering the toll house cookie pie to go.  I'm actually excited to come back to this place to try some more items off the menu."
2390,Great food and the wine was delicious! We went to the bar after dinner and had more wine and sat on the sofas and played cards that were available. Had a fantastic time. The best neighborhood bar in this area!!! The staff is very friendly too!
2391,This was the worst experience I've ever had as a diner. We had 7:45 reservations for 6. There was a party sitting at the only 6 person table in the restaurant. They offered us a 4 person table as we waited at the bar area. We waited 30 minutes without a single person acknowledging us. Finally I asked about the situation and we were told it shouldn't be long. After another 20 minutes we were given menus to look over. We were finally seated after 1 hour of waiting with no sorry or offering of an appetizer or drink comp. When we asked for a manager she was completely unapologetic and blamed our party for not cramming into the 4 person table. I have worked in the restaurant industry for numerous years and if any of my bosses heard me talk that way to a patron I would of been reprimanded on the spot. This is a terrible excuse for hospitality. Our first restaurant experience in Maine was completely ruined.
2392,"Reasonable prices and great food. Not sure what happened to all the bad reviews. We had three people and order two dishes to share, lobster omelette and lobster Benedict. I also ordered a blood orange mimosa. The bill turned out to be $48 dollars. Will definitely come back if I ever visit Portland again! 8/7/16"
2393,I recently moved up to Portland from wmass and the weekend I did my parents drove up to help me get settled.  We were having a hard time picking a place to go for dinner on a Saturday night in August that would appeal to my mothers picky eating. There are so many places within a 15 minute drive around Portland and being new to the area I was relying heavily on the Yelp app. We ended up deciding on the The Snow Squall. This place was absolutely perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone willing to listen. It's on the smaller side and we didn't have reservations but we're seated immediately in the bar area on a high top table. There was a woman playing acoustic covers which I would have scoffed at previously but she played so many classic hits that I found myself singing along all dinner. The eggplant Neapolitan appetizer  is TO DIE FOR.  I'm not joking I have dreams about this dish. So good. For the main course I had a pork special that was a little over cooked but still delicious. My mom had the fried chicken and my father had fish. Overall it was an awesome experience. Highly recommend. And I'm going back for that eggplant.
2394,"Review is for drinks only: went in on a rainy Friday night and had such a lovely time.  Sat at the bar and the service was friendly, approachable, and made damn good beverages.  I went for their twist on a moscow mule which had some grapefruit juice in there...hubs got rogue dead guy beer.  Live music that was very pleasant.  Lots of happy people inside, great vibes."
2395,"A neighborhood favorite- consistently good , very friendly servers- you can get apps, sandwiches or a full dinner-  sat at the bar tonight to watch a football game- lot of regulars (you could tell)- server Colleen Foley was fabulous- very comfortable spot- highly recommend"
2396,"Excellent place for lunch or dinner even just apps. They have a great dinning room and bar and nice outdoor seating. I had fried haddock fish chowder and onion rings. The fish was fresh and delicious, the Onion rings crisp and the chowder to die for. I highly recommend the snow squall"
2397,"Dined here on vacation with our toddler late in the evening. Was pleased to sit in the comfortable patio setting, perfect for a messy child learning to use a fork. Strong cocktails, delicious food made with local ingredients and an exceptionally friendly staff make this a gem!"
2398,"I adore the Chowder Plate always - wonderful haddock chowder and good fresh fish but today we tried the veggie nachos app at lunch, and have to add  to our list of Do Not Miss. They are not your average corn chips and cheese- wow. I've never had the likes and try them! Light and crisp and you can't stop!"
2399,"We love the happy hour here and what a perfect place right by the marina that is quiet, yet lively. Get the mussels and beer!"
2400,"No deck for us, middle of winter when we stopped in at Snow Squall. Nice, quiet ambiance, small bar, soft lighting. Good service, decent prices (little pricey), good food, smallish beer list, but good options for what they offered.
I had the fish n chips, very good, nice light fish with tasty batter and fries that made you keep wanting to eat them. My girl had the steak tip salad and enjoyed it. Solid place, would go back at some point, many other options in area though"
2401,"I went here for dinner and to grab a drink or two.  

I'm a little tougher on this place because the ambiance wasn't what i was truthfully expecting.  It's a bit of a small restaurant and it wasn't too packed on a Saturday at 5PM.  For some reason they had the lights as low as possible, almost to the point that we were about to request them to turn it up so we could see our food.

The menu is decent with a good portion focused on fresh seafood.

I had the fish sandwich and it came out great.  Cooked how you'd want fish and chips to be cooked, and the tartar was ok.

Their fries are GREAT!  I'm not sure if they cook them with onions or if they cook them in balsamic dressing, but these might be some of the tastiest fries I've had.

Friendly wait staff, food came out slow, dark lighting, good drink selection.  Solid 3/5."
2402,"The food was really delicious.  The service was excellent and we enjoyed the live music by Jimmy Jenkins and his very talented partner.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.
KK"
2403,"Worst experience I've ever had anywhere!  Not only were the bartenders extremely rude but I waited 20 minutes to be able to order my food and 10 minutes for a to go box(it wasn't busy at all either).  I've never felt so disrespected when in an establishment.  I wouldn't recommend anyone coming here and I won't be coming back to this place again either.  I would strongly recommend going elsewhere, especially if you're looking for a warm welcoming experience."
2404,"I'm going to give the Snow Squall a 3 here. It is more like a ""conditional""
3.5 because a second visit is really in order to be accurate, but I have to say, my first experience here was rather positive, so here's to hoping. 

Tonight I was craving a rare burger and David's 388 is always my ""go to."" However, we had a party of three and they were booked until 7:30 (on a Wednesday!). We took a shot at the Snow Squall. As a local, I am a bit surprised at myself for passing over this restaurant in the past, but it's definitely on my radar now. 

The homemade tortilla chips are a must. They arrived hot with guacamole and salsa. Awesomeness on a platter.

I did indeed order an Angus burger with caramelized onion and blue cheese, rare. It was cooked absolutely perfect (this doesn't happen often; when I say ""rare,"" I mean it). 
The sweet potato fries were good (really, is there anything better than David's 388 white truffle & garlic fries? I think not). Also, Snow Squall can definitely do better on their choice of hamburger bun. Really. I challenge them to kick it up a notch. 

Being a gin gal, I ordered the gin/elderberry/cucumber drink. Elderberry can be overpowering, and our server was great in recognizing that I may send it back for a different balance (yes, it was, and more gin balanced it out nicely. It was served in a ball jar (I expected a martini glass) and was quite strong in the end (this is not a negative, just an observation). I was really impressed with their mixed drink selection; it was inventive for the venue. Nice selection of beer on draught as well.

The service was great. Our waitress is buddies with our favorite chef at David's, Dylan, so I think she met our approval early on! She was just fantastic. 

Overall, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed my experience at Snow Squall. The atmosphere is a tad stale for my taste, but the experience and food will definitely bring me back in; I could even be a regular."
2405,"We wandered into the Snow Squall on a warm Sunday morning. The porch seating was shaded and cool, perfect! Meghan was our wonderful server, she was so personalble and friendly. She took the time to learn our names and invited us back. The brunch food was delicious and the plates so bog we couldn't finish. I ordered a Mimosa and it wasn't one of those dinky cups filled with ice. It was large and worth the price. 

This place is worth a visit. We will def be back once we move to the area!!"
2406,Great Friday happy hour. Lot of cheap eats if you do not want to be a big spender. There is a great menu and specials to have I you want a full meal. Great waitstaff the checks in often.
2407,"This is our go to place for our Friday night date! Great live music, never a bad meal, and the staff and decor is very inviting! Drop in and sit at one of the two hand built bars and order the nachos! Best ever! Make reservation if you don't want to wait- busy and full of happy customers!"
2408,"Stopped by The Snow Squall for brunch - first time. Corned beef hash and poached eggs, with potatoes and focaccia bread toast. Italian toast and a side of bacon. Great coffee and a Bloody Mary.......how could you go wrong? The service is first rate as well."
2409,"Great mix of traditional coastal Maine restaurant + slightly progressive food/drinks. Bar / lounge is the only place to sit. The 'dining room' area feels too brightly lit and old-school - but then again we're typically the youngest in the place, and we're both 32. 
Surprisingly great cocktails, terrific bartenders, and nice little touches like the homemade tortilla 'chips' used in the nachos (so so good). Not everything on the menu is exciting or out of this world, but it seems they're catering to a range of palates."
2410,Still delicious- had the salmon wrap today served by Garth. Great food and great service!!
2411,My husband and I love this place especially in the off season when it's less busy. Great tasty good quality food. We eat here all the time and haven't found a dish we don't like. There soup bowls are huge so bring your apatite if you are going to have one.  It's a great friendly atmosphere and the staff is very welcoming. We only usually sit in the bar area and it's nice because we will stay there for a bit and have never felt rushed. It's a nice hidden gem in South Portland.
2412,"What a disappointment. Food was mediocre but high priced. The mussels were under cooked, many didn't even open. When I asked the waiter to replace the bad ones he said he couldn't that since the kitchen was too busy. If a kitchen is too busy to cook food thoroughly, maybe soon hey won't be busy at all. After I complained, then the waiter treated us very rudely. The rest of our food wasn't very good either. You can get much better food for that kind of money somewhere else."
2413,"Great party atmosphere on a Friday night, many customers seemed to know each other. Spontaneous dancing to the live music by a couple who had just sold their business that day.
Drinks so so. Large and inexpensive. Food however not so good. Had salmon on quinoa with side of spinach. Everything soaked in oil. Would have preferred drier meal with citrus instead of oil. Gastrointestinal distress shortly after meal.
The mussels we had as an appetizer were good but broth too salty.
Would return for drinks, or much lighter fare."
2414,"Would it kill the chef to use some seasoning? Bland food in a nice pubby atmosphere. I found it expensive for what it is. I'm not in love, but might try it for lunch in the future."
2415,"Not the same as it once was. To be fair, we left and food not eat there this time. No towels in restroom, worn menus. Our last time there several years ago it was a fancier place but also more expensive. You should know if you haven't been in several years that it now has a smaller menu (at least for lunch, dinner might still be elegant). Nice setting but more of a cafe feel. Since we were celebrating graduation we left to find something a bit nicer."
2416,Excellent all around restaurant!  The service is great and the food can't be beat!  We've been there several times and are never disappointed!
2417,"The Snow Squall had been on my list to try for sometime. I always imagined it to be a fancier restaurant and I think that delayed my visit. After checking out their website and noticing their nice happy hour specials (1/2 price apps and good drink prices) we decided to give it a try.

The main dining room is fairly large and there were several groups having dinner. We decided to sit at the bar for a more casual atmosphere. There was a good crowd around the bar and the restaurant had excellent live music going ( I think they do that every Friday).  One of the patrons actually joined in on vocals at one point and was spot on. We split three appetizers and left stuffed - the portions were large and the food was very good.

The woman behind the bar, who I believe was the owner, was very friendly. They have outdoor seating and she said during warm weather they have the live music outside. It seemed like the Snow Squall can cater to those looking for a more intimate setting or those just looking for a casual bite. We'll definitely be back."
2418,"I love this place!  Their breakfast on Sunday mornings competes nicely with any other breakfast place in town.  Their staff is amazing!  Those gals strive to remember my name, and greet my guests warmly each time I stop by.  I am partial to the Shedd brown ale they serve, icy cold!  I have tried most things on the menu, and have been very pleased with the quality and quantity.
This has been my go-to place this past winter, as I frequently take advantage of the overstuffed leather sofa and club chairs in front of the fireplace.  We enjoy dining right there, in front of the fire.  This is a place where they remember what you drink, and how you like your steak and eggs.
Their specials are quite pleasing, with a nod to fresh ingredients.
One of my favorite things about the Snow Squall is that there is ample parking!  The restaurant nuzzles right up to the wharf, so the clanging and visuals of large boats is fun, not to mention the squawk of sea gulls and the smell of the sea."
2419,"Went here on a Sunday evening July 3rd with my girlfriend and we sat ourselves on the spacious outdoor patio. I had a Monkfish and lobster entree which was very good. My girlfriend had Scallop and Shrimp risotto which was good except for the overwhelming taste of lemon. I'm a person who loves lemon with my seafood, so I tried a taste of her dish and even I thought it had too much lemon. We didn't have any problem with the service, but the 2 ladies at the next table did. Coincidentally I knew one of them and she wasn't happy because they asked for bread and didn't get it. There was a party of 22 that was dining and that threw things off a bit for the waitstaff. Perhaps management should have staffed up better since it was a holiday weekend. I'd like to mention that the cocktail menu and beer menu are fairly extensive and there were some good and interesting choices on there. Overall I was happy and wouldn't hesitate to come back, especially to sit on the nice patio again."
2420,"A local hangout that is very popular on weekends.  Solid food, nothing spectacular but reasonable for the price.  However, tonight I had a terrible experience.  Simply, it was crowded, told that the wait for a table would be 30 minutes.  No problem.  At 1 hour 10 minutes I asked the hostess if the wait would be much longer.  She told me that they had told their diners, who were lingering, that they had 10 minutes to vacate their tables.  That I thought was surprising.  However, we were indeed seated in just a few minutes. Service was good, food slightly better than adequate, however, we spent one hour at dinner (which seems long for the food/atmosphere) and I could not get a second drink.  I asked a new waiter who started to serve my table for a drink and several minutes later reminded him that I was waiting for my drink.  Alas, no drink and the meal was over.  For some reason, asking our original waitress to split the bill for two people seemed over the top and a definite attitude set in.  Huffy, short, sarcastic.

When we left I mentioned it to the hostess I did not appreciate the short attitude from the waitress and that in 3 hours and 15 minutes we could only be served two drinks.  I was told if I didn't like it I should consider never coming back.  Also, my attitude about asking the status of how quickly we could be seated was ""confrontational"" in her opinion (sorry, being told 30 min and it turned out to be 1 hour 15 minutes is reasonable, don't you think!!!!).  Anyway, very very unprofessional and quite disappointing.  I was told I could speak to the manager which I did immediately after leaving the restaurant (by phone).  Her name is Heather, quite professional and apologetic.  Granted, I was not pleased that our service was inadequate but to be told if I didn't like I could take my patronage elsewhere speaks volumes.

Bottom line - I would not give them my business again.  Chronically understaffed and the snotty attitude of the hostess is a complete unprofessional example of not being well suited for the position.  I spent years working in the food industry.  As much as you don't like it, the customer deserves respect.  

The irony - 1 good review and a few take notice.  One bad review and everyone will pick up on it. 

Too bad."
2421,Waiting for a reservation at expensive Old Port restaurants? Don't bother! You will find a great new eatery just over the bridge in South Portland called The Snow Squall. It has a mix of casual bar atmosphere and a white linen dining area. Menu is healthy and tasty! Their fish chowder is the best in Portland IMHO. Large glass windows give you a view of the marina and Portland harbor. Outdoor seating seasonally. We fell in love with the place and will be back with family and friends.
2422,"I came home from Boston for Mother's Day and took my Grandma and Mum to Snow Squall for brunch.  We had a 1pm reservation and got seated right away. There was a lovely band playing, which my Grandma just loved, and all seemed like it was going to be a perfect brunch... Disappointingly the band would be the only good part of our brunch.

20min after being seated we still had not been greeted by a server.  When she did appear to take our drink order, it took another 20min to bring two Bellini's and an iced tea to the table. We placed our order....50min later the waitress appeared again to apologies for the long wait (although the restaurant had half a dozen empty tables) and to tell us the kitchen had run out of homefries, green peppers and onions.  For a restaurant serving brunch to run out of essential brunch menu items is just ridiculous.  Once our order did come out of the kitchen, my Grandma was severed cold French toast, my mum an omelet (less green peppers and onions) that looked hastily slapped together and my own meal of short ribs was very fatty and over cooked. Finally to get our bill I had to ask another server to find our waitress, as she was no were to be found. And even after our long wait and the kitchen not having enough items for our meals...nothing was taken off of our bill.  

I was extremely disappointed with Snow Squall and would not recommend or bring my family to this restaurant again."
2423,"I was pretty hesitant to make reservations here, since the overall reviews weren't great. I am glad I did! The service was great-not too slow, but didn't feel rushed. They have a casual yet upscale atmosphere, with some nice live music on Friday/Saturday nights. Water is served at the table without having to ask and nice cloth napkins are provided. A great beer and wine selection. We order bruschetta and crispy chicken wings to share between 4 people. Chicken wings were to die for-not deep fried but so crispy and tossed with house made buffalo sauce and served with house made ranch and blue cheese. Bruschetta was made on locally made focaccia and was delicious! Our entrees and appetizers were nicely spread apart. We enjoyed a special of pancetta Mac n cheese with seared scallops, a hanger steak entree, a chicken, artichoke and Smoked bacon entree, and a haddock sandwich. Everything was superb. The desserts are house made too and are also wonderful. I also appreciate that anything that is not made from scratch in house is purchased from local businesses, right in Portland! We will be back to try brunch!"
2424,"This is a great space with a nice atmosphere right near the harbor at a marina. The staff is very nice and attentive. There is a nice long full bar where you can eat snacks or diner. There is a couch and stuffed chair area to have a drink and snack and a bar area high table section. The full service area is spacious and relaxing. My best experience is the brunch- homemade hash, poached eggs cooked just right. The hollandaise is much better than some other area restaurants.
We love brunch there. The dinner menu is good to look at but the reality is a little disappointing. Not awful and really nice as a neighborhood destination. We are very spoiled in Portland because of the great food that is available.  We Portlanders get very picky. I have been around the country and eat at lots of 'good' restaurants and oh well, not so good. So to sum it up this is a very convenient restaurant with great brunch and decent dinner. I have never tried the lunch offerings. 
Their prices are  varied which is nice. You can spend some or just a little.  It is a nice ""just down the road"" meeting, eating place for people who live nearby."
2425,"The wife and I came here but were a little apprehensive because of the previous reviews on Yelp about the food and service here but we took the plunge anyway and were pleasantly surprised.

The service was top notch even with the packed house that they had filling the dining room.  The parking was plentiful for us to get in, again even with a packed house.  The view is stunning looking out across the water at the city of Portland.  The windows all around the entire restaurant gives great views from all angles and the outside patio will be a sight for sore eyes during the warmer months.

Our food was fantastic as we had the calamari for an appetizer and it was tender and flavorful and perfect (the wife can be picky when it comes to calamari but she loved it as well) and the main courses were Short ribs for me over the top of potatoes and a side of asparagus and the wife got the gnocchi with some feta cheese that was refreshing and tasty and super flavorful.

Our flourless chocolate torte cake was nothing short of awesome.

The only flaw here was the beer selection when I asked for a hoppy IPA the bartender recommended a beer (must have wanted to get rid of it) and when I didn't like the taste, the server agreed that he never recommends the one I got and came back with another one that was top notch.

After all was said and done, the server brought our check on a little tablet where we ran our card and tipped him and was on our way.

I have to say the Yelp 3 stars and less reviews were tough to overcome but I am so glad that we did."
2426,"Went for dinner. View of Portland is amazing. Located right on the water. I imagine this place gets pretty packed in the summer. There's a cute little patio to sit on. Also large parking lot in the front.

We started with the pimento bruschetta which was so good. Comes with four pieces. The calamari was okay. It wasn't chewy or anything but it was still just okay. I got the haddock which had a massive piece of fish sitting on top of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. I normally absolutely love haddock. I thought it was decent, but the fish I get at the fish market in Portland is a lot fresher. My husband got the special which was a lamb shank over sweet potatoes and he loved it. The other couple got short ribs and sword fish which they both really liked.

They have the check splitting down. When it came time to pay your check is on a little computer. It allows you to split the bill. You can choose either completely in half, or by item. Then you add the tip. You put in your card and it's done. No more waiting for the waiter or waitress to come get your card and run it and come back. It was honestly pretty sweet."
2427,"The view at sunset is THE reason to go. The food on the menu consists of slightly overpriced, somewhat generic seafood dishes. 

The lobster bruschetta is decadent. Creamy, heavy, and would be great with a light wine as a light dinner on its own. Definitely share it!

If you like intense flavors, get the asparagus gnocchi dish. I hated it, but it's not my flavor profile.  

The seafood pappardelle is fine. That wilted spinach doesn't add to the flavor, it made my dish a bit bitter. But the seafood was cooked perfectly. I suspect all the seafood is cooked well here, though I only have these dishes to judge from. 

Service was pleasant and a late evening dinner means no waiting during tourist season."
2428,"Because it's summer & it's on the water I decided to give Saltwater Grille another try even though I was underwhelmed on my last visit.  I'm happy to say the food was much better this time.  I got the Fig & Goat Cheese Salad.  If you like goat cheese, this is for you.  It's loaded with goat cheese, perhaps a bit too much but I happen to love it so it was fine for me.  The honey balsamic vinaigrette dressing was also a lovely element of the dish as were the candied pecans.  Our server was attentive & friendly.  It was a great night to be on the deck sipping cocktails & eating dinner.  I'd definitely go back."
2429,"I'm giving two stars for the dock side views in the day time. However, I have never been impressed with the food or the drinks. I've learned not to order the cocktails because they taste watery and weak, so now I usually just order the prosecco because it comes in a small bottle that is opened right at the table and you pour it yourself into a glass. 

On last visit about a week ago, my friend and I both ordered the NY strip steak that comes with squash, fingerling potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. Both of our steaks we ordered medium. Hers actually came out medium and she finished it. Mine was so well done that I only ate a couple bites and didn't finish it. It was gross. There was about a tablespoon of squash, a couple tablespoons worth of Brussels sprouts, and probably a whole potato of fingerling potatoes. Not a good balance. The big disappointment was that my steak was pretty much inedible but I was with a large party and didn't want to make everyone wait while I sent it back to have another one cooked."
2430,"We arrived just before lunch ended. They said they needed to 'clear a table' only to find out that they were many empty tables when we got out there. 
The woman who went to clear a table walked out 10 mins later while we were still waiting, the girl at the desk had to ask if it was okay to seat us as she was walking out. I asked if their Bar menu was all they had and said I needed more time with the menu to choose but the waitress never asked us again about food! She did stop by once and asked if we wanted another drink and to drop the check.  It was pretty clear customer service is not required to work there."
2431,"The view from the outdoor patio is enough to make any patron want to stop and visit for hours on end. Unfortunately, the time for that isn't always there.  I stopped into the Saltwater Grille yesterday for a casual elegant lunch where we could sit outside and enjoy the lovely spring day.  We were greatly quickly and given menus and ask for our drink order.  My friend got a snow day, she loved it and I ordered lemonade.  We ordered the pimento bruschetta to start, followed by the club sandwich and a veggie burger. The food came out quickly and was excellent the veggie burger was one of the best I've had out at a restaurant in a very long time. It was very awkward to eat though because it was extremely large requiring a fork and a knife instead of being able to just pick up it. The reason for four stars is that the waitress simply didn't cut it. I never got a refill she was missing for the majority of the mail, it was very busy in there so it's quite possible she was just super busy but it was very hot out and I would have loved a refill. I also thought it was very odd that I had to tip the waitress before she ran my card. I have never encountered that at a nice place before.  Felt uncomfortable. I would certainly go back just hope for a different waitress."
2432,"Highly recommend. Great spot with quality food that provides awesome views of the Portland ""skyline"". Their Mango Habanero wings are also so tasty!"
2433,"Great service, yummy food and beautiful view outside while eating. We had lobster bruschetta to start and had delicious dinners (I had Haddock with purees garlic potatoes and green beans)."
2434,Expensive for the quality and options. Server was extremely nice and the redeeming factor here. Lobster bisque is LEGIT. Tables were sticky and something that we couldn't identify came out of the water bottle when we were refilling our glasses.
2435,"Hard to believe after over a decade of reliable dinners I have had such a dreadful experience that warrants one star. My family is visiting from out of town, and we bring them here for dinner twice a year.

Today the sun was shining very brightly and it's when I noticed for the first time that there are no pull-down shades maybe because it's usually cool enough inside. That would have been manageable with sunglasses except that it was very hot in the dining area. I mentioned this to the hostess who seated us. She replied that the kitchen ""door"" (?! it's an open kitchen and we weren't right next to it) is open so it gets hot in there. I asked if they could put on the air conditioning and she mumbled something and walked away. Meanwhile there was plenty of air conditioning blowing where she and some other staff congregate near the front entrance which also happens to be dark and cool without it.

The water was lukewarm with no ice.

I ordered the 8 oz ""Bistro Filet"" medium rare and silly me, I figured I was getting a tender filet of beef, if not a filet mignon. Price is $30. What I was served instead were two small pieces of medium well meat that were like black leather on the outside and was tough and dry on the inside. I had trouble cutting my first piece that was inedible. It was terrible in texture and taste: burned, dry, chewy. I complained (politely) to the server who explained it's a teres major steak. In other words a shoulder cut. The ""filet"" came with some kind of ""kale slaw"" which was uncooked kale with a white drizzle over it. I sent my meal back and did not order anything in its place other than a plate of mashed potatoes for which our server did not charge us. He was apologetic.

By the end of dinner we were all sweltering and couldn't leave quickly enough. We did tip our server more than 20% because he handled it well, but we will not be back after the experience today. I think it's crazy to charge $30 for an 8 oz cheap cut of meat. Most people, myself included, will feel duped thinking they are getting a filet mignon, especially at that price. I feel like the management no longer cares about their customers. If they did they would turn on the air conditioning, get some see-through shades that could be partially drawn as to not obscure the view, and not charge $30 for a cheap poorly cooked piece of meat."
2436,"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is the view. Other than that,  these people should be ashamed for so openly gouging diners on mediocre food. Tonight I paid $32 for a pasta dish with 4 scallops. That's not a typo.
the scallops were good, but advertised as seared. They were not seared. No caramelization. Pasta was ok but not worth $22 (you add $12 for the 4 non-seared scallops). Those are steak prices.
$36 for the steak and scallop special. Those are NYC prices.
And...
How can a seafood place not sell oysters? I was shocked. The place sits right on the water and no one thought, ""we should serve oysters""?
Olive oil for dipping was bitter and unpalatable.
Fries were good.
Never will waste my hard-earned money there again, sorry."
2437,"I come here at least once a year because of the view patio. That I will give 5 stars. The food seems to change a lot. My most recent trip had friendly staff, but the sandwich, man what a disappointment. A perfect day, with perfect weather, ruined by a lack luster over cooked chicken sandwich. I should have got the haddock, but I wasn't in the mood for a mess. $16 for a small piece of chicken, LTO, and ""salt n vinegar"" chips, where the vinegar was absent."
2438,"Fireworks on 4th of July from the deck overlooking Sunset Marina=gorgeous! Phenomenal staff (as always) and spectacular food and drinks. Great summer cocktail selections. Meals are beautiful, delicious, hearty. Seafood. Fish. Steak. Salads. Desserts. Everything was amazing. Couldn't have been any better!"
2439,"We had a phenomenal meal here last week.  I was a little hesitant due to the iffy reviews.  I had the most perfect martini, extra dry with the lovely ice skim across the surface.  My companion requested a margarita which came out pretty as a picture and equally delicious.  We started with the lobster bruschetta.  Outstanding with generous portion of lobster on a grilled bruschetta and a tasty Boursin bechamel. More than enough for two people.  I then ordered the pasta seafood dish.  Rich house made pasta with generous portions of jumbo shrimp, huge scallops, mussels and a smattering of crabmeat. My companion had the baked haddock. Wow!  An entire filet of haddock atop a bed of mashed potato and fresh green beans. I was so pleased with the meal and of course the views.  Our server (Kayli?) was right on with timing and attentiveness.  Def recommend."
2440,Beautiful restaurant and amazing view. That's about it. Food is mediocre there was essentially no seasoning on the salmon. Gnocchi was bland and same for the lobster linguine. Could have made better food at home for 1/3 the cost. Way overpriced. Beer list was okay at best. Essentially paying for a beautiful view of the water. Really good service too.
2441,"Just got back from eating there with a group of 12. I ordered a Moscow Mule and there was no vodka in it. Told the server and he literally LAUGHED in my face, saying ""I saw him pour it!!!"" Really???!!! 
Then, I ordered an appetizer size salad ... and was brought (and charged for ) a full size salad. Which I ended up taking home since I was too full (hence why I ordered an appetizer). ... Food itself was OK but nothing to justify the insane price tag! Another person at our table got the Asparagus Salad... came without the asparagus!!!
The view is beautiful! 
But I am all set... not going back there!"
2442,"Stopped into this restaurant for lunch while in south portland for the day. It was a beautiful day so we sat on the patio. It was very peaceful, overlooking the harbor.   The service was excellent. We had a waitress named Brooke and she was very friendly and efficient.  They have great drink specials. We ordered the clam
Chowder, lobster bisque, salads, and the burger. We were very happy with our meals.  I will definitely be coming back here when I return to south Portland."
2443,"Gorgeous atmosphere. I have been dozens of times, and always recommend it to people who visit Portland. The view on the deck is perfect and the service is excellent. The food is great, but I do find it to be a bit overpriced for what you get."
2444,"Go for the view. Take a picture. Leave.

I want to like this place. Every time I come out of my way here (for the view, mostly), I want to like this place. 

The problem is, the waitstaff always seem to wish they were somewhere else. We showed up the other day and the place was less than half full. At the hostess stand, two waitresses were wrapping napkins and basically ignored us. (It's an odd and unfortunate place to do ""behind the scenes"" work, but if you are going to have people there, have them greet guests.)

One guy barked at us that he'd be right with us, and then disappeared for five minutes. Sat the couple in front of us, and disappeared for another five minutes. We were just about to go when he came and said our table was ready. 

We ended up having one drink and left. I'd say I'll never come back, but I'll probably be in the area another day when the sun is setting only to be disappointed again."
2445,"Some* gluten free options and dockside dining!

I've been to Saltwater Grille many times over the years. We were dining late and wanted to see what was left of the sunset, so we chose this location. We figured that after dark, we could still enjoy the lights of the city across the Fore River. When we arrived, the entrance was so dark, we weren't sure they were even open! (Are there some bulbs out???)
We got there just as they were stopping the seating of guests...just made it with only minutes to spare!
We were seated by a window (easy, since it was late and a quiet Tuesday.) 
I went in with mussels and lobster bisque on my mind! As I looked at the cocktail menu, I couldn't help but notice the Spring/Summer drink menu was not there...that was confirmed by the waiter. With just days before Memorial Weekend, it was still their Fall/Winter drink menu. Disappointing! 
I ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and it was as DELICIOUS as I remembered! My companion ordered the fish/clam chowder and it was okay...waaay too many potatoes! (I tried it, and neither of us will order that again).
The menu had four different preparations for mussels. I ordered what I was told was the way they had been for years (marinara) ... and when it arrived, I knew it wasn't what I'd ordered many times in the past. Even after great discussion with the waiter. I didn't care for the marinara prep, but WORSE, about five of the mussels weren't open and about four/five of the mussels were so stuck to the shell I couldn't eat them. THEN, one mussel tasted WRONG (bad), so I spit it out. I couldn't eat the rest of my mussels after that. The fries were good, but are cooked in shared oil, so not really* gluten free. At $20 for a bowl, that was very disappointing. 
Because it was the end of the night, we didn't see anyone but the waiter, so couldn't say anything to management. The waiter was very courteous and prompt. 
The other dish, at $30 was pricey for a HUGE amount of pasta and not so much seafood...but it was very tasty (I was told.)
We've decided to just come for the lobster bisque and call it good...
I'm sad, I love the environment here!"
2446,"The 4th of July, not as busy as we expected so that was good. Sat right down, the waitress took our drink and app order and everything was great then we asked for a suggestion, it's pretty easy to tell when the waitress is trying to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu as ""the most popular"" but we went for it anyways. The lobster fettuccine, HORRIBLE!!!! It had no taste and the lobster had shells in both dishes and it was just bad. Only good thing was the wings and the time it took for food to come out."
2447,"I'm rounding up to three stars only because of the view. We had a great table right on the water with a wonderful view of Portland during sunset. Magical. 

We ordered two gin basil gimlets -- what we got was two glasses full of gin, water, agave,
ice, and cut up basil. Not a hint of lime. It was not a well crafted cocktail. We also ordered the crab and avocado appetizer. While it was a good portion, the guacamole was not very good. Some salt and lime would have made it much better!

I might be back just to sit and have a beer. That's it."
2448,"Amazing view! Sat outside on balcony. Waiter was great, only complaint was we had to ask for bread after he said that he would bring it to us. Pirate punch was a delish adult beverage. Spicy Thai wings on special were so good, some of the best I've had. Also avocado crab tower was great. Penne carbonara for $22 wasn't really a $22 meal, nothing comes with it and portion wasn't huge. No clue why pasta, sauce, pea pods and bacon costs $22 to make. I'd probably get the haddock sandwich next time which looked good and was $15 and came with chips. Dessert was a brownie sundae and that was also good."
2449,"Had a great experience. Good food, a wonderful view and a great Aussi waiter! I would highly recommend it."
2450,"The view is beautiful, right off the docks so the smell of salt air is right there and I think it's so peaceful. The group of us shared apps, the fried calamari and the jerk chicken wings. Both were great. I had the chipotle short ribs and the mashed potato and corn. It was very tasty but lacking salt. The group of us tried almost all the desserts- panna cotta, donuts with caramel sauce, s'mores parfait and brownie sundae. The donuts were AMAZING. The s'mores where awesome. The panna cotta had a nice flavor but had to much gelatin and I didn't try the brownie but heard it was good."
2451,I was in town for a family reunion and had the opportunity to have lunch at this lovely grille. We sat on the deck and enjoyed the harbor view and lovely weather. The food was delicious - I had the biggest shrimp cocktail ever! - and the service was terrific. Janet took great care of our family. I recommend stopping in!
2452,"Nice service and staff and view. . Very poor quality of food. 
Big portions ,bad quality of food. Would not reccomend at all"
2453,"If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Portland - this is the place. Set on the opposite shore, you face the city skyline and what a great view! Fabulous waterfront seating in season as well.  Plenty of free parking and nice decor, casual, trendy with an upscale vibe.

They have a great bar area and a nice cocktail, wine & beer and bar menu. Glad we made reservations in advance as it was a busy dinner time.  We were seated right away. So many nice appetizer plates to share - we loved the cracklin calamari.

The dinner entrees ordered were: Grilled Salmon, Broiled Haddock, Lemon & Thyme Mussels with Fries, Crispy Half Chicken, Short Rib Pot Roast and Front St Rib Eye Filet.  All beautifully plated and enjoyed.  I thought my Mussels were the best I've ever had!

We would definitely suggest this lovely restaurant to anyone and would go next time we are in the area."
2454,"Had a birthday party dinner with a close to a dozen people. Initially there was a hiccup with our reservation,  but this was quickly rectified and we were seated promptly. Our waitress, despite dealing with a loud, boisterous group, maintained professionalism and took our orders in stride. Food wise, I ordered the chipotle short rib entree. The meat was tender and delicious with a sauce that was slightly overpowering, but still tasty. The meat was served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of crushed avocado. The mashed and avocado were tasty, but didn't really fit with the theme of the short rib, I'd have preferred more creative sides. After speaking with friends, their reviews of the food were also quite good.

Overall the service and the food were tasty, and the view of Portland is almost unparalleled. Recommended for a bite for a larger group and a great view!"
2455,"Amazing fried haddock! The French fries were probably the best, I have ever had. Very crispy and seasoned with what tasted like Cajun seasoning. I would highly recommend the old captain mule, if you want to get a drink."
2456,"Took my sister and daughters for dinner.  Joe's service was excellent;and, the food,  delicious.  Lobster pizza, haddock dinner were excellent.  Great view of Portland."
2457,On our way to Booth Bay Maine and stopped to try the restaurant. This was the best seafood me and my wife have eaten so far. I had the Haddock sandwich and my wife had the Lobster roll. A must stop while in Portland ME.
2458,"Waterfront location off the beaten path with a comfortable casual ambiance.  My grilled salmon was nice and hot but nearly overdone; veggies were only lukewarm - nevertheless tasty food.

Server was pleasant but oh....so....slow.....  Took far too long to take our drink, entree, dessert orders and deliver them; checks too.  Will give server benefit of doubt; perhaps they were short staffed that Saturday night in February."
2459,"Just had lunch here on a Wednesday afternoon around 2:30. 

Absolutely fabulous. Beautiful building with a deck over the water butting up to a marina with the Portland skyline in full view beyond. 

Food is top notch, great pricing for the quality. 

Service was great, other reviewers must have visited during a busy time without considering things happen at every restaurant when it's busy. 

Will come again as soon as we are back in town. 

Thank you for the outstanding lunch in between sight seeing all the lighthouses."
2460,"Beautiful view and really cute interior.  The food was good, not amazing, but I really enjoyed the carbonara and the mussels. It was a little pricier than I expected."
2461,"If the food and drinks were good, they could justify their pricing. But they don't understand food or drink. The cocktails are watered-down and inconsistent. The desserts are cloyingly sweet. Everything they serve is unbalanced in taste and texture. The ocean view doesn't save them--plenty of Portland is on the waterfront."
2462,"We just celebrated my brother's 60th birthday party here! The food, service, bartender - every thing was top notch.  We will definitely be back to the Saltwater Grille.  One small caveat to an otherwise stellar experience.......

The directions from your website (via Bing) indicated to take a left on Sawyer Street near the Gulf Station.  What Gulf Station?  LOL The Gulf Station has been renovated into something else not even remotely looking like a Gulf Station LOL, but thanks to trusty GPS we got there before the guest of honor.  Thanks again for a wonderful time!"
2463,"Great waitress,  Julianna, Saltwater Grilll!! Loads of personality, helpful with menu items both drink and dinner! View very nice. Staff were moving all night.

Food was great, prices reasonable. Overall nice experience."
2464,This restaurant has a beautiful view. The true downfall here is that EVERYTHING on the menu is overpriced.  $26 for fried clams.  $32 for a steak. $12 for a bowl of lobster bisque.  Not worth paying that price for the view. The food was average nothin to write home about.  Service was average.  I do not see how they get off charging such ludicrous prices. So many options in this area.
2465,"Beautiful views of Portland from inside of restaurant and on the deck.  Good cocktails.  Food is mediocre, which is too bad for such a great spot."
2466,"Bill Riley  Many years ago (Channel Crossing) this was a great place. Several years ago it was an ""OK"" restaurant with just ""OK"" food but it still had a wonderful view of the harbor.  Now the view is the only redeeming thing about it.  The food is poor, uninspired and quite frankly: just plain awful.  It would be grossly over-priced even if they offered it at a third of the menu price. 
Before yesterday, the previous time I was there I witnessed one of the chefs use a towel to wipe his brow (understandable in a hot kitchen) and then set the sweaty damp towel on top of a stack of clean plates that he was putting food on. That night the food was also awful and for those reasons I swore then that I would never go back. However, I did go back.  I guess I was hoping that time would heal the wounds. I WAS WRONG -  WHAT A MISTAKE !   While the view and service was good, the FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY SUB PAR. Will never go again for dinner! Please Lord, Don't let me make this mistake again."
2467,"Came here on Labor Day so my boyfriend and I could enjoy cocktails outside on the deck overlooking the water. It was about 6-8 minutes that we stood there waiting to be addressed or waited on by staff. Plenty of them passed by, 2 servers even stood right there and folded napkins and answered the phone...never once asking if we have been helped or needed to be seated. 

Finally an uptight, gruff man (who seemed to be in charge) shouted over to us as he was walking by (never stopped to ask us how many in our party, what we wanted, etc), just yelled, ""Two..? Gimme 5 minutes I'll set up a table outside."" 

So we waited some more. before we were finally seated. The man hurried off in front of us, held the door as we went out and pointed over to a table and said, ""You can sit there.""  It was all rather rude. 

And it was unsettling to see 3 servers all standing a that front counter - never waiting on customers that came in after us - and each one looking like they literally hated their jobs and would rather be anywhere else but there. I have honestly never experienced anything quite like this before. The absolute worst of the worst as far as attitude and customer service. 

Was going to give this only 1 star, but gave 2 because the server we actually got was very nice and one of the drinks we ordered was particularly good. Otherwise, no need to come here again."
2468,"Incredible ambience, beautiful view of Portland over the water, absolutely incredible food. I'm torn between giving two or three stars because our service was so incredibly slow. Granted, we had a party of 15, however from beginning to and we were there for 2 1/2 hours, which in my opinion is unacceptable.  It took 10 minutes before we were greeted at our table, and a long time for drinks to come out, and not all of the drinks made it to our table without us having to ask. Then our server kept walking by until someone in our party finally asked if we could please order our food. Then, about 15 minutes after we were done eating, the server asked if we wanted separate checks. It then took about another hour for the process of handing out the checks and running the credit cards. I'm sure with a smaller party, this is an amazing place for dinner. However I would never, ever, return with a large party again."
2469,It's a great spot.  Let me say that.  However it's always an uncomfortable spot because there are always upset patrons.  The staff is pretty incompetent and rude and makes this a spot to go to for a drink with a view.  Stay away for a nice meal.
2470,"They may have a new chef or management, I heard suddenly things have improved so we went there for a recent lunch with some concern. My fried was right, it has improved, the service was better than ever, the quality of the food has dramatically improved so we will return to see if it is consistently so. I enjoyed the special of the day, a grilled short rib sandwich that was so good my mouth is still watering. My spouse had the fish and chips and that was also fabulous. What a relief. We love that location, the view, but we have not gone back for several years because of the disappointing food. That said, Lunch and late lunch in most Portland restaurants is far superior to over priced dinners. And in the winter, we prefer to go while it is light outside."
2471,"Best lemonade I've ever had.

The Lobster bisque was pretty solid.

Surprisingly, the lobster fettuccine was nothing special."
2472,"I personally had a great time. 

The outside of the building had the old time restaurant look but the inside was fantastic. Option to sit out on the deck, or get a nice table by the window. We chose of course to eat outside. 

The owner sat down a spoke with me a bit while I was waiting for my party, I didn't even know it was him, some guy just came up and was friendly enough and kept me company for a bit. 

The menu has a lot of great choices for seafood and some for non seafood eaters. They are gluten aware and were able to take care of me. 

We had a business/casual dinner there and kept the waitress busy, who was fantastic. 

I had the rib and kale salad with mash potatoes. Loved it!

The rest of my party had several other things from the menu and were as equally pleased as I was. But they were from the south and any seafood might have pleased them. 

This place is pricey and we racked up a huge bill. But it was 100% worth it."
2473,"This is the favorite spot if my BFF, and we were lucky to snag an outside table at 6:30 without a reservation!  Joe promptly came to our table and provided friendly service.

We enjoyed the sunset, which negated what I thought was a long time before the delicious dinners were served.  We had fish and beef, all 4 of us loved our meals.

Joe was game for credit card roulette, and he thinks chivalry is alive and well, so the credit card with the mans name was picked for the bill !

This venue is a perfect spot for sunset with a fabulous view of Portland.  The slow dinner service held me back from 5 stars!"
2474,"Spectacular views, and nice ambiance.  Not a 'quiet' setting but a good date spot. Food was plus, and the server was great! Wish I had her name, but she even took the kids in our family out on the deck to play! Def a well rounded spot to enjoy as a family, couple, or solo."
2475,"This summer, Saltwater has become one of my go-to spots. I've been trying to spend more time on my side of the bridge (SoPo) and Saltwater is really the best option if you want something nicer/upscale with a great view of the harbor. I almost always opt for a glass or two of wine and a salad with salmon, but I'm sure there's much more to the menu than that. 

I truly appreciate good service and I really like the bartenders and servers at Saltwater - they're always attentive and friendly. 

As I said,the view from the deck can't be beat and sitting outside on a beautiful summer is a real treat."
2476,"This used to be a restaurant where good food was served and you could enjoy breathtaking views of Portland harbor. We were there yesterday for dinner. The hostess sat is in a table near the window where the sun was directly in my face the whole time. There were no shades to pull down. View was amazing though. The bread served was kinda stale. We ordered haddock cheviche and calamari. 

Now I have had calamari all across New England and although there are some variation's it is prepared with light breading. The dish that arrived was a deep fried mess. There was more breading than calamari and was super oily! Totally unappetizing. The chiveche that followed...tasted like I had a bowl of squeezed lemon juice and nothing else. You can't taste the fish in that dish. Totally disappointed, I thought the shore dinner I ordered would lead to redemption. Boy was I wrong!

The guiness battered haddock was deep deep deep deep fried. I could not taste the fish at all! The crust was so thick that it came apart in one piece. Fish was tasteless. The clams were also very oily and deep fried. The shrimps were perfect and I enjoyed them.

Overall, very disappointed. The restaurant is on a downhill slope. Sub par food is served at 5 star prices. Please fix the kitchen else this restaurant will become just the memory of what awesome food it ""used"" to serve.

One star for cocktail and desserts and one star for the view."
2477,"Not good. Got a salad and realized after  the waitress left that there was  no bacon and no onions. Kept eating because we were hungry and never saw her again. When she finally came around, the salad was finished. 
There are better choices for restaurants."
2478,"You'll come here for the seafood, but you'll stay for the views. I used to get the scallops, which were recently taken off the menu, but can be made upon request (which is always nice,) but they were too salty on my last few visits. I ordered the salmon on my most recent visit, and it was pretty standard. Cooked just right, had a good balance between sweet and savory, good salmon. The food, overall, is good but nothing overly special. The views, however, make the whole experience much more special. The restaurant is settled right on the water with a perfect view of the boats and downtown Portland. It's pretty special, and worth the try."
2479,"Nah. I'm not even a foodie and this place didn't impress me. Food was typically expensive for the location (which was admittedly nice), but the prices were unwarranted. The waitresses were alright I guess. They got my order wrong, but I assured them it was fine because I had already waited long enough."
2480,I really wish I could give a better review. We loved the atmosphere and the views are amazing! Unfortunately the food was presented well but really lacks in flavor. The staff was also very friendly. Maybe the cook just had an off night but of the 4 people with us only one had a meal worthy of such a great location.
2481,"One of the most beautiful views of Portland.  definitely sit outside on a summer night.  Pasta with a lobster cream sauce was excellent.  I split this dish with my mother and it was a perfect portion.

New York sirloin was horrible.  my partner had this and he said the meat tasted old, no flavor and overcooked.  The baked potato was cold and the string beans looked like they were canned and not fresh.  too much money and horrible quality. 

i would recommend going for a drink and having an appetizer only."
2482,"We drove up from Mystic, CT on our way to Booth Bay Harbor and found this place for lunch. We enjoyed it as it is relaxing, clean, and on the water in a marina. I was surprised that Portland is more industrialized than I hoped for, but this was nice and waitress Janet was fabulous!"
2483,"We had our rehearsal dinner here and was an amazing experience. Meghan was lovely to work with, super accommodating. I was pleased to have our own room and the food was great. I struggled in Portland in finding restaurants to accommodate 25 people and was thankful to seek out Saltwater."
2484,"I went to lunch with my Mom and her best friend.
They ordered the Fish and Chips, and I had the calamari.
We were all very disappointed. The batter on the fish was so thick and hard, they had to break it off and just eat th fish.  My calamari was over fried and very chewy.

Would not go back for lunch"
2485,So THIS is what we have been looking for and found! We stopped here right off the docks after our fishing excursion with Captain Ben.  Our Uber driver said to try which we did. Best Seafood and environment since we've been in Maine. We sat on patio and looked out onto boat docks and ocean...I would go for lunch...the fish and chips and lobster roll were divine...a perfect stop! Oh and she said their lunch menu was new
2486,"The food is decent, the wine is good, and the view on the patio is the best on a hot summer day!

I've never been disappointed with my choice to dine at the Saltwater Grille!

The fried calamari and baked haddock bites are delicious, I personally recommend!"
2487,"Some of the worst food I've had in a long time. Ordered the lobster bisque, it arrived and it wasn't even lukewarm and was tasteless.Then we ordered the calamari, it was heavily battered, had no flavor, and slathered in balsamic which made it soggy. Had to be one of the versions and the worst order ever of calamari. Asked for lemon wedge, it arrived much later and the calamari was then cold. My water glass had a gigantic crack down the side, couldn't ever get the waiter's attention to get another glass. Just not a good experience, would not ever, ever, ever recommend."
2488,"First time visit for myself, husband and guests, but daughter and sil have been many times.

We have recently rented an apt in Portland to spend more time with our newer granddaughter and are slowly circulating thru restaurants.  I am fussy.  But I am also more than willing to pay decent $ for good food.  I claim to be a foodie and the prospect of spending a lot more time in Portland excites me for that reason.

Tonight's dinner not so much.

I ordered the seafood Pappardelle which states to include lobster, one of the main reasons I ordered it.  Once delivered I started mixing it and found one 1/2"" piece of lobster skin.  I did not find anything else and asked the waitress if in fact the description said that there was lobster in this dish.  She assured me that there was and believe me it is in there.  OK.  So I proceeded to eat and search, and search and search.  No more lobster.  Zero. None.  Zilch.  Didn't even taste a lobster flavor to the dish.

Came home and looked at menu and noticed that there was also basil in the dish(supposedly), well didn't taste any basil either.  And the chorizo tasted weird.  The shrimp was good, as were the mussels but I ordered the dish for the lobster component.

Tasted my husbands scallops and they were not ""dry"" scallops, and no sweetness whatsoever.  Wow, hard to believe!

Dishes that were reported to be good: gnocchi with sage pesto (which I tasted and had a nice flavor) but chicken nothing special that was added to it.  Special of Crab and lobster scampi which two diners ordered and liked.  Desserts were ok.

Service was good but could not make up for my disappointing dinner.  Deck seating great, even though it was 92 degrees and umbrellas could not be lifted due to the winds.

I have way too many other establishments to explore so will not be back any time soon, if I will at all.  Shame since the location is great!"
2489,Very Disappointed in the food here. Got the rib which was very chewy and had no flavor. My wife got the Tuna steak and that was extremely bland. No seasoning at all. If it weren't for the fabulous location this place would be out of business. I suggest going for the view and drinks only.
2490,I have gone to Saltwater Grill for over 20 years... At the end of June 2017 I got food poisoning ... I contacted both the restaurant in the South Portlandd health inspector and there both they told me there was no way I would've got food poisoning within two hours... I went to my primary care doctor and she confirmed that I get food poisoning from salt water Grill room...don't patronize them I've heard of four other people in the last month and I have gotten food poisoning there and the owner of the Saltwater Grill in the management blows it off... Karma will come back tomorrow
2491,"I love the ambiance at the saltwater grille, both inside and outside.  I made reservations for my daughter and I last minute and got a really nice seat outside.  The views are pretty great, and the ambiance is so charming...from the jazz music to the owner passing out sunglasses, just a great experience.  My daughter loved the fish tank inside and I'm actually looking forward to going back in the winter to enjoy a warm meal inside. 

The food, for the price was just ok.  The drinks (although a short menu) are great and the service is pretty good.  Plus, they were really great with my young daughter.  I just wish I loved my meal - it was expensive for what I got.  So, I would definitely suggest going - but maybe for apps and drinks and to enjoy the scenery."
2492,"Fast service, great atmosphere, and delicious food made our dining experience splendid! We tried the fish 'n chips and the crab cake sandwich from the lunch menu and were greatly pleased. The portions for both meals were surprisingly big and prices weren't overly outrageous. The haddock from the fish 'n chips was cooked to perfection with a light batter. The haddock was served with seasoned fries and some mustard coleslaw. The crab cake sandwich was delicious and had a fair bit of crab meat. This sandwich was served with their homemade salt and vinegar chips which were amazing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good food and great views."
2493,"The ambiance and service were a 5. However, of the three entrees we had, two were bland (lobster fettuccine and pappardelle). I would come back though."
2494,"I am a bit biased.  My mom and dad frequented the place when they lived here.  Upon his death, we held his wake in the private room upstairs.  The owner is a friend of my mom's, but that won't keep me from being truthful :). 

The prep for my dad's wake was done long distance (II lived in FL at the time - 2005) and they completely delivered. Nice staff, every detail taken care of. We could relax at it and not be distracted by ""how things were going.""



More recently:  I was here a few weeks ago on vacation with my mom (now 86), my sister and my husband (who'd never been and loves scallops).  They also make great Martinis, according to my mom. :)  We told the server my mom was there, and to tell the owner her name.  He came right over a few minutes after our drinks arrived and it was nice to see them re connect. 

Food:  Three of us had the scallops. LOL.  Wonderful lobster risotto under them.  Very  nice. 

Wine: I had a red I had never had before. Name is escaping me, but it was excellent. 

Service: No complaints other than she wasn't sure if they had any Sherry and had to ask. 

They seated us in what they called ""the lounge"" which was a smaller room off the main dining room. This worked well as it was nearly empty and my mom has hearing aids which makes restaurants hard for her due to all the ambient noise. 

Overall, another on my list to go back to. And not just because I know the owner. It's in the oddest location though...."
2495,"The greatest things about the Saltwater Grille are the following: the view from their deck outside, the fish tanks inside the restaurant, the fire places inside on a cold winter night, and the mints you get on the way out.

The staff is pretty slow and going for a quick bite to eat during lunch time won't be very quick at all. The view is worth it, the food is not. I really wanted to like the food, I did. I wanted to so much so that I ended up getting a standard chicken club. The chicken was burnt and smothered in a chipotle sauce (that wasn't very good) and the french fries were kind of soggy. It took so long for my lunch companions and my's food to come out and there were barely any customers in the dining room or on the porch where we were stationed. I also asked the waitress for honey mustard as soon as she brought our food order and never received it. By the time she came back for another check-in, I had almost already finished my food.

I might be back sometime in the summer months to sit on the deck, take in the view, and enjoy a cocktail, but that would probably be the only time."
2496,"This place is great - the view outside over the water was breathtaking at sunset.

Came here with a large group of about 20 people, and the reservation had us sitting next to each other split into several tables. Worked out perfectly! They were maybe 10-20 minutes late getting us into our seats, which was okay as they have a nice lounge area. The bartender during this waiting period was a little rude, having to ask us several times to remind him what we ordered after chatting with other guests (and wine pours were a little skimpy and inconsistent among guests), but whatever.

Food was great - shared the lobster cake special with my mom, and then we each got 1.25lb steamed lobsters. Cooked perfectly, lots of drawn butter, and the mussels and corn are perfect accompaniments. Great ambiance, great food, okay service, a little expensive - but overall a good find!"
2497,"Solid brunch spot. Our server was super friendly, and you really can't beat the location. I can't wait to go back when it's warm enough to sit outside. Good food, good prices. And healthy sized mimosas."
2498,"Nice, comfortable, by the water...basically ""touristy "" restaurant. Pricey as would be expected of that location. We both had chowder starters...mine haddock, hers lobster bisque. Both very tasty, well done, though not the best in town or the area.
Followed by Shrimp Quesadilla, which were very fresh and flavorful , though basic.
May be back if had visitors in town."
2499,"The ambience and view were great, but this is a restaurant that serves food - which was horrible. I had the teres steak, which is a shoulder cut. It seemed it was cooked and reheated- grossest piece of the most expensive steak that I have ever had. The slop it was served with looked pretty gross too - mashed potatoes with creamed kale on top. It was not aesthetically pleasing at all. Overall, really bad experience here. Opt for better options or just have drinks here, no food."
2500,"We ate here July 5.    Fireworks were pushed back a night due to the hurricane, and I wanted to be able to see them.   We were staying at a hotel in South Portland near the airport.   Husband found Saltwater Grille online.   He made a last minute reservation.    We showed up early and the owner was really great.    We hung out at the bar and listened to two old men (wannabe pirates) quarrel and it was awesome.    The owner collected us and brought us to a table outside overlooking the marina.   It was lovely.  

The cocktails we had were tasty.    Lobster cakes were a delicious appetizer. I had the scallops over lobster risotto and they we're cook well.  My husband had a special--stuffed haddock--which he enjoyed.   Biggest complaint was that I had to ask for bread.   

As we got our entrees the fireworks began and were lovely.    They wrapped up as we finished our blueberry pie.  

Overall, the food was good but the view was even better.     It was a good find by my husband!"
2501,"We've been coming here for years. It's been nice to take our friends and family out for traditional Maine seafood dishes and not have to fight the crowds in the Old Port. That said, the service and food has gone a little downhill due to lack of consistent service. It's more hit or miss now and really depends on who is cooking and who's waiting on you! 

If you are looking for THE BEST Maine seafood and meal in the Portland area, this is probably not it. BUT if you are looking to grab a drink, sit on a deck overlooking the water and marina, maybe order an appetizer- Saltwater Grille's patio is perfect for that! 

If you looking for a place to take the family or friends, they offer decent food, although prices may be a bit high, portions are usually fairly big, there's a full bar and open kitchen, and guests seem to love it!"
2502,"A very ordinary experience and, for the quality, too expensive.  The menu has a limited number of selections.  I tried the haddock stew and it was quite good.  However the Cajun shrimp scampi lacked shrimp (only 3) and lacked flavor.  Lots of noodles but they were not tasty enough to eat.  The lime pie should have been rich and creamy with sweet and tart lime flavor but it was heavy, sweet, and disappointing.

Only redeeming factor is the lovely view of Portland and the harbor.  

I would not recommend."
2503,"My wife and I recently had our wedding reception there and it couldn't have been a better experience.  The food was excellent and reasonably priced.  The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for and views of the harbor were beautiful.  

The staff there, especially Megan, made everyone feel right at home and took all of the stress out of coordinating the event.  Megan went above and beyond to make sure everything went according to plan and that everyone had a good time.  We had an outdoor wedding and the weather forecast called for rain.  She said we could use the adjacent room to host our ceremony at no charge!  Try finding that with another venue.  I would recommend Saltwater Grille for any event."
2504,"Good Happy Hour with special prices on apps and drinks. Beautiful views, nice atmosphere."
2505,"This was the FIRST time I have EVER had to leave a restaurant because of a horrid experience. Being native to Maine I have been here several times and raved about it to my girlfriend (who is in town with me from Texas). I had a 7:30 reservation and we got there at 7. They told us they wouldn't be able to sit us until the reservation time which was perfectly fine. At 7:40 I left the bar to inquire about when our table would be ready. The hostess, (who turned out to be a manager), said ""yes, your table is ready whenever but it's busy so I don't keep track of people and wait for them to come back to see me"". Uh. Ok. As a server for several years I've never heard of this happening. We then sat down around 7:45 and ordered our dinner by 7:50. The food hit the table at 8:30. The fried haddock was literally a rock. We told the manager about it. When she came over to address the issue SHE GRABBED THE HADDOCK FROM THE PLATE AND SQUEEZED it to test it. The health code violations involved with this. I am so disappointed with this experience and encourage everyone to try elsewhere."
2506,"Prices way too high for what you get. We ate inside by the window for dinner. A fair number of folks ate outside, several came in because it got cold.  The restaurant not very busy for in season--might be the quality of food versus the price.  The bartender ( a delightful young woman) was the only redemning quality.  Waitress was a graduate of ""Waitress 101""--never look at the customer when going by. Food was mediocre, at best.  We used to own an upscale inn and, having eaten in many, many restaurants, would say there are plenty of other restaurants in South Portland where you can get your money's worth."
2507,"Firstly, I would give the restaurant ambience/scenery/location a 5. It's very pretty here. We wanted to love this place. My husband and I took our 2 kids (12yo and 8yo) with us. Our server was not personable nor polite. I ordered the special which was supposed to be a lobster and crab scampi. It was ridiculously bland, the pasta was overcooked and it honestly looked and tasted like canned tuna on plain pasta. It was horrible. I did not complain, however. My husband ordered the pesto gnocchi with scallops. The sauce was like thick paste. It was horrible. He had two bites, pushed it to the side. When the waitress came back she asked how we liked the food. I didn't mention mine, but my husband did mention that he wasn't thrilled with his. No apology nor did she ask if he'd prefer something else. She literally walked away and left the dish there!! When my boys would thank her for something, she never said a word. She was not a good server and the food wasn't good. Bad experience. We just moved here and I would be embarrassed to take my family here."
2508,had reservations for the deck for 6 for special occasion lunch- typhoon ensued and we were relegated to dark corner table- food was  good and over ample portions-we were all amazed at lunch blackboard special -chicken and penne- $28.00?!?!? Service was spotty- couple of group ordered dessert - waited for 15  minutes and dessert did not come......cancelled as we had to get back to work
2509,"Experience: very very slow service. We had a large group, but only one server and to be fair the restaurant was busy. Waitress didn't check in on us once after food came, food was not very warm and when we were done with dinner didn't offer coffee or desert even though breakfast would have been more appropriate at this rate. We had a 7:30 pm reservation and at 10:15 pm just got our check. Everything from the drinks to placing our order to getting our food to paying has just been too slow. I would not return with all the other options in Portland."
2510,Great experience the first time I went and the view is awesome but I just went there again and waited for my food for a very very very long time. Thought it was busy but when I walked to the bathroom there wasn't that many people in the restaurant. Also as you walk out to your car at night you can see/ hear the kitchen crew outside smoking/joking about customers which happens at all restaurants but behind doors not by the front door of an establishment.
2511,"(6) of us had lunch at Saltwater Grill today and (3) got the lobster salad for $22/each.  I was amazed at how small the amount of lobster was given on each dish.  Maybe 2-3 oz. Came with lettuce, few mini tomatoes, and several sticks of hard asparagus which was very touch to eat.  The lobster was undercooked, had the wet look, and tasteless.... Very surprised that a restaurant here in Portland area, on the water, specializing in seafood would serve a dish that was worth maybe $10 or $12 at most.  For $22 one would expect a great lobster salad and not one that the customer would leave hungry.  We will definitely not be back...."
2512,Went for a work function for my wife.  The only reason I am not giving one star is that the Maker's Mark Manhattan that I had were great.  The appetizers were not as good sadly.  Scallops wrapped in bacon came out cold and the bacon was undercooked.  The shrimp cocktail sauce tasted liked it had been sitting around for awhile.  Everybody that ordered Filets were disappointed because we got charcoal tasting overcooked hockey pucks and I ordered mine medium.   I would never go there if I was paying for the food but may go for a drink :)
2513,"Once again we thought we'd try as the view is great.
The service is atrocious. The only place I've walked out of due to the utter lack of effort by the waitstaff.
Food is marginally ok."
2514,"So this used to be my favorite restaurant in Maine... things have changed, oh how they've changed!

A couple weeks ago a friend and I had theater tickets and decided to grab a late lunch beforehand. We went with ample time to eat (1 hour and 45 minutes, to be exact) and were greeted by a hostess (?) who seemed to have way too much going on. This is where I should add the the place was less than 1/3 full, on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm.

We are seated and the hostess turns out to be our waitress. This is where things start going downhill fast. We both ordered the Lobster Corn Bisque, which while good, would have been great had it been hot... it was luke warm at best. My friend and I couldn't understand why we were served bisque that wasn't hot, as my friend pointed out ""Isn't it just sitting in a pot on a warmer?"" Apparently not!

Our waitress is literally nowhere to be found. She appears after we have finished our drinks and bisque and takes the cups away.

Thirty minutes later, we have no entrees OR refilled drinks and have not seen our waitress. People who have arrived after us have since received our food.

Fifteen minutes later still not food OR drinks. At this point it is clear we have been forgotten about, and have less than 30 minutes to eat before we need to leave to get to the show on time. 
Our waitress finally walks by, sees us at out empty table and remembers that she went to refill our drinks. She made a remark like ""Oh, I accidentally dumped them out..."" pretty much solidifying she forgot about us... and then added ""I'm sure your food will be right out...""

Five minutes later she comes out with out drinks. Another five minutes and out comes our food. It was glaringly obvious our food had been sitting for quite some time... my friend's fried fish sandwich was luke warm, and the cheese on crab melts had gelled together and oil had formed on the top.

We tried to make the best of it, but it was just inedible. Our waitress walked by after about 10 minutes and saw we weren't eating. She asked what was wrong and I proceeded to explain how our food was not hot and had clearly been sitting in the kitchen. She instantly got defensive and said that the picked up the food ""As soon as it was ready!"" Ok lady, oil doesn't pool on freshly melted, hot cheese! So she took our uneaten entrees away without so much as an apology.

A few minutes later a woman, who I imagine was the manager, came by to see what was going on. We explained the situation to her, and she apologized, offered to get us something else (we didn't have time or the patience!) and then took out entrees off the bill.

It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had dining out, and am not sure if I will go back!"
2515,"Food was OK but not exceptional. The deck has a nice view of the yacht club, Casco Bay and Portland ""skyline."" Nice place to watch the sunset while you eat."
2516,"Fantastic food and drinks - and the view does NOT disappoint. Make a reservation (they encourage them) and sit outside if at all possible. Awesome view of the Portland skyline and shipyard. Food was incredible - if you can swing it, make sure to get Sallie as your server. Attentive and fun! Made for a great honeymoon dinner! #thevoyage"
2517,Came here for a friends party recently and while I was amazed at the breathtaking view I was underwhelmed by the service and the food options. I'm plant based and while I don't expect a seafood place to have a ton of options for vegans and vegetarians in 2016 I would expect a few more possibilities.
2518,"OMG delicious. I ordered the so po ""buoy"". HEAVEN. Holy moly pure heaven. Lobster tail, shrimp, mussels in some sort of tomato lemon sauce with capellini. This was just perfect. 

**Perfect as in if I was on death row this would be the LAST MEAL. ORDER the SO PO BUOY!!

The restaurant is right on the water, nice view."
2519,We sat outside and enjoyed a delectable lobster dinner.  That was a key goal of our trip and Saltwater really met it.  The staff was friendly and the views were awesome.  As good as it gets though a little pricey.
2520,"I really didn't want to write a bad review and truly this is my first ever written on Yelp but I felt responsible to warn anyone expecting much of a meal here. I've eaten lunch outside several times and had a fine burger and fish and chips. But when i finally brought a whole dinner party in I expected something special. OK it was a Monday night which can be a risky if the kitchen staff had a big weekend. However, that said given there was no one in the place I would hope that at least the wait staff would attend pretty lovingly to a table with an elderly diner and a younger child. Throw us a crust of bread for god sake so we won't wonder where you've disappeared to.

 Alright so the server was all talk and no service. The food - Cesar salad is often so abused I hardly ever order it anymore ( but I love it) and at the price I had high hopes. Awwww"" Applebees style"" overdressed with almost indelibly tart lemon Cesar dressing and stale croutons. Burnt lobster flat bread, boring lobster salad, etc. I could go on ... but i won't Great haddock chowder, I admit. As I stared at Becky's diner from the table. Seriously disappointed and for the quality, price, and service I was bummed I didn't stay in Portland. I did  get a view and that's something."
2521,"Chose this restaurant for a special occasion. The service was  inconsistent. The food was totally disappointing, probably reheated, so you had mushy over fried fish. When asking if a dish could be slightly modified for a vegetarian, the reply was,""We don't do that."" When asked if the huge portion of calamari could be halved for one person, ""We don't do that."" Are you imagining a crazy day? In fact there were only several other diners in the restaurant. 100% disappointing."
2522,"The views, food, and service all excellent!
I'll have no problems recommending clients here."
2523,"I have really mixed feelings about my experience at Saltwater Grille. This was my first time in Maine and I had to try some lobster. I don't typically eat lobster, so I cannot even begin to say whether it was great lobster or ok lobster. The restaurant itself is cozy and quaint with a great view of Portland across the water. I had the lobster which came with mussels and corn on the cob. Sadly, after devouring the entire lobster and most of the mussels i was still very much hungry and longing for more flavor. I ordered the pecan pie for dessert which was very disappointment. Service was friendly, but only saw my waitress once after receiving my meal. The hostess made up for it though. She checked on me a few times and brought me my dessert.

I would try this place again, but my first experience was just OK."
2524,"Great view, friendly staff and good food. We go here often and sometimes we like what we get and sometimes we don't, but am always pleased and comforted by their decor."
2525,"Lucas and the team at O' Oysters are excellent communicators, and really nice guys that love great oysters. We hosted a welcome drinks event at Rising Tide Brewery and had O' Oysters come to make our beer-and-pizza event a bit more festive. 
From the time I first contacted him through the day-of communications, Lucas kept me up to date on everything I needed to know and worked with me to make sure that we had a good variety of the best oysters available. He was more than willing to go out of his way to source out-of-state oysters from the Narragansett Bay area and from PEI, but also let us know about the best local Damariscotta river options. 
At the actual event, Bob, the most efficient and clean oyster shucker I have ever seen set up the oyster cart early and was ready to go by the time guests started to arrive. The oysters themselves were some of the best and definitely some of the freshest oysters I have ever enjoyed anywhere. Though the oysters definitely did not require any additional flavors, the accoutrements O' Oysters brought were perfectly balanced and complimented the oysters exceptionally well without masking the oyster flavors. I particularly loved the subtle Jalapeno mignonette sauce. 
I cannot say enough good things about Lucas, Bob and O' Oysters. Nice, professional guys that know their oysters and deliver great value with excellent service."
2526,"Amazing oysters!  We have bumped into Lucas and his oyster cart all over town, from charity events to farmers markets.  Cold, fresh, and shucked to order, he will open as many as you care to eat.  Always includes homemade accoutrements, including three or four different mignonettes, lemon juice and cocktail sauce.  If you run into his cart, absolutely down some raw oysters!"
2527,Lucas is great. Amazing info on his oysters and has the best oysters. Thanks for turning me onto oysters I am low addicted. As with my 12 year old
2528,"Scheduled stop in Portland.  Got off of the ship and ran right into O Oyster.  Loving oysters we stepped up and enjoyed several of the freshist, best tasting oysters I've run across.  Toured the town and decided to stop back for dessert.  It was so nice to have good fresh oysters and not have to do the restaurant thing to get them."
2529,"O' Oysters catered our wedding and it was absolutely amazing! Lucas was friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable -- and the oysters and accoutrements were delicious. We'd highly recommend them for any special event -- our guests were thrilled to see the oyster bar and it really made our wedding memorable."
2530,"We made reservations the day before and was given the option of where we wanted to sit, which was nice. The hostess also suggested which ferry we should board in order to make our reservation on time. I though that was helpful. 

The gentleman who greeted us upon arrival was very friendly. Our waitress was also friendly, attentive and very knowledgable about the dishes & specials. 
I ordered the surf & turf (it wasn't called that on the menu, btw) & my husband ordered a pasta dish with chicken. I requested medium well steak but it came out well. The lobster was tender and fresh, but I didn't expect anything less than delicious lobster from Portland, ME! The potato skins were crispy on the outside and nicely salted and baked to perfection.  My husband enjoyed his pasta dish. I'm still giving this restaurant a five star because the beautiful view of the marina, water & docked boats made up for my over cooked steak. 

Sit out on the lawn for the best experience, especially if it's a warm sunny day. 

Our waitress suggested the smores cheesecake and it was to die for. I may sound crazy but I would return JUST for that cheese cake...oh and the lobster too:)"
2531,"The flies could carry one away!  We left there with bites all over our legs and feet. Other diners were wrapping their legs in napkins!
Food was over priced and quite average and most all room temperature.
Ordered dessert which never arrived and coffee was cold.  
Not sure what their problem is but the kitchen can't handle a crowd and they are too cheap to use an organic fog to minimize flies and mosquitoes 
Will not go again even though it is a great location and beautiful view."
2532,"Overrated and overpriced. 
The sparkle of this island staple -- Diamond's Edge -- has lost its luster. The pristine location is overshadowed by slow and rude service. Enjoy the boat ride, skip the restaurant, eat on Portland's peninsula."
2533,"We had a wonderful dinner here at the end of August. The seafood  was delicious, especially the mussels and halibut. The portions were generous compared to other restaurants in Portland.  Our server, Olivia was exceptional!  She was attentive and very pleasant even though it was an incredibly busy night.  She helped to make it a memorable evening.

The view overlooking the harbor was breathtaking.  We will definitely visit this restaurant again."
2534,"We had a surprisingly delicious dinner here on the lawn. We love the location and it's fun to either take the ferry out or hitch a ride on a friends boat! 
We have not had great meals here in the past, but on this occasion the food was really good. I had a lobster and pasta dish and a shrimp cocktail. Perfectly cooked. Our server was very good and we had one of the best nights of our summer there. Very picturesque spot."
2535,"If you're coming, ask to be seated outside on the lawn. No matter which table you get, the view is spectacular. The kind of view - sparkling ocean, sailboats, islands, the ferry coming and going - where you think to yourself, ""It doesn't get any better than this. Why would I ever leave this amazing state?""

But other things were a little more miss than hit for me personally here; the menu is VERY limited and they aren't willing to make too many accommodations (for example, I saw someone's meal came with fries and truffle aioli, I asked if I could get a side of that, and I was told ""absolutely not""). The prices are also pretty steep for the portion you get: I thoroughly enjoyed my truffled mushroom bruschetta (which was meaty, tender, juicy, and cheesy in all the right ways), but it was a very, very small amount for $13. My cocktail was also disappointing: I got an extra dirty well vodka martini that was almost all olive juice and no vodka for $10 ($8 for vodka and a $2 up-charge for martini according to my bill) - just seems, again, steep in comparison to other places throughout the Portland area. I was also slightly put off by my waitress; she seemed unimpressed with us and every time she came to check in she seemed harried. So not a very welcoming environment from her towards us; on the other hand, the busboy and hostess were an absolute delight. Both much more personable and friendly!

The warm rolls and honey butter were divine and - along with the view - absolutely worth coming out here for. The ambience both inside and out were really inviting as well (though, a note about their outside space: I think they should put up strings of Edison lights or wrap the trees in fairy lights or something because when it got dark on the lawn, it got DARK and the only light came from the building [which didn't illuminate much in the yard]).

As always, come out and make a decision for yourself! You will fall in love with the view and the rolls, though, that I'm sure about!"
2536,"The view on the lawn is a breath taking 5 stars, with the harbor and ships and waves of blue ocean rolling by creating a salty breeze perfect for summer. The air is clean and fresh and is great for enjoying drinks with good company. 

The service was less than average often worth long waits. The only stand out was Bryce who was not assigned as our waiter but still provided stellar service, filling drinks snapping pictures, giving info about the location and even permission to wander the lovely area with drink in hand. He did everything with a smile and took pride in every task. 

The atmosphere wants to be serene and open but still gives a pretentious vibe. When asking about orders apps from the bar bites, the response was to chef with the chef to see if it's allowed. The prices were high for what should be fresh caught seafood. The food was unmemorable, aside from the bread. The complimentary bread was soft with crisp exterior and served with softened honey butter which was fabulous. 

The pork belly app lacked flavor but was well cooked. The edge burger was dry and flavorless. The sweet chicken sandwhich was served on a nice toasted ciabatta bread but the chicken and filling just didn't come together. The meat was tender and small, filling only half the bread and overall lackluster. The main entrees started at about $30 and up. The smores cheesecake was good. The filling was soft and the marshmallow topping toasted. The mint leaf was fresh and added a nice pop of color of flavor."
2537,"Very nice young man served us-
Mark? - from west roxbury, mass. Gave us a history of the island, and made us feel very welcome. The berry salad with lobster was out of this world- the corn soup delicious, the naan salmon sandwich was good not great- all in all a wonderful and relaxing spot to look out at the boats. Just be a little careful of exploring the island- as this is the private side of the island. A young man named robbie mccarthy - doing 'security' on a golfcart almost ruined our visit - doing his best to represent the HOA- rushing us away from the inn where we were trying to check it out to potentially stay. not a reflection on the restaurant but a major issue that needs to be addressed by the island- not the restaurant's fault but can impact guests!"
2538,"Great location! Hostess was helpful when making reservations on what ferry to take. Bar was a bit unorganized, bar top was sticky, and the wine list was disappointing. Was hoping for more than Kendall Jackson for a place of this caliber. But the rest of the experience was A+. Our server was attentive but not hovering. Pace of meal was perfect. Menu was diverse. Husband had black and blue filet mignon and I had sea scallops. Honey butter for the warm rolls was a treat. Our table was on the lawn. Amazing views and a peaceful setting that is hard to find these days. We would definitely go back."
2539,"Hard to review a place with a gorgeous setting right on the water. Tried to ""walk in"" at 6pm, all tables empty, and we were told by three snobby waitresses we needed a reservation. We made one for next night (not much of a choice!). The service was fine, sat on the grass by the water, The food was sub-par. The oysters were good, the fish was super salty and buttery and hard and dry, like something your grandparents would get at olive garden and say ""Wow! This is fancy!"". All of the food had that ""An-old-person-would-think-this-was-fancy"" feel. Very expensive considering the quality, but...it's the only restaurant on the island. Capitalism, save us."
2540,"The location is beautiful and that's why they get one star. The food however was way overpriced for minimal quality. The service was agonizingly slow. 
Our salads were minuscule and cost $13.00 each! One strawberry was cut into 4 pieces and the greens were not fresh. 4 shrimp cost $15.00. Seriously??? Just because you are on an island does not mean you can gauge people the way this establishment does. Will not go back here- major league rip off!"
2541,"Came here with a small group at 7pm on a Wednesday night. We sat outside overlooking the ocean and boats in the distance. The service was very attentive and the attention to detail was great. They brought drinks quickly and kept our glasses full the entire time.

The bread and butter was the highlight of the food. I would have just kept eating this if I knew what was waiting for me with the main course. I ordered the edge burger and had high expectations for this burger. When the burger arrived the meat looked a little over cooked and dry, which once tasting it was. 

I also ordered the pork belly as an appetizer, this was actually really good. 

For dessert, I had the s'mores cheesecake, which was great until I learned that marshmallow is made of leftover animal parts. How did I not know this? Kinda ruined the dessert. But not the restaurants fault.

Overall a great place to grab drinks and enjoy the view but not the best food."
2542,"Found this amazing place on a sunset cruise.  Booked a table for the next day and got a lot help from the restaurant as to which ferry to use etc.  We arrived and were seated on the lawn by the water.  Ordered from the very nice wine selection and took in the beautiful water, waves, boats, and gulls on Diamond Cove. The rib-eye steak was superb, as well as the Atlantic Cod.  The blueberry pie with ice cream is the best pie I have tasted in a long time.  Our server was very attentive.  What a great evening for us during our ME adventure."
2543,"We stayed at The Inn and treated ourselves to dinner at Diamond's Edge.  We made a reservation, and we were fortunate to get the ""best seat in the house"", which is the end of the deck closest to the water.   I got bourbon and my wife got a mixed drink (maybe a little too sweet blueberry lemonade); both were generous. Salad and chowder were terrific.  My tuna was off he charts good.  Wife's chicken wasn't very adventurous, but also quite good. In summary, food was great and location is sublime."
2544,"I got a salad, which was really great, but my brother ordered a steak medium rare, and it showed up well done. However, the other orders that showed up for the people in my party looked good. It's a very scenic spot, so therefore it was an enjoyable experience."
2545,"We visited Diamond cove and Diamonds Edge restaurant on a recent trip to Maine to visit family. We were seated outside and it was a perfect day. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and clearly enjoyed her job. I had a salad with lobster added and it was fabulous. We all enjoyed our food and the setting. The restaurant is in a lovely setting, with wonderful waitstaff and excellent food!"
2546,"What a wonderful place for dinner! Starting with a scenic ferry ride to Great Diamond Island, getting off and walking 100 yards right to the restaurant. We had reservations but got there a little early so bellied up to the bar for a cocktail. The bartenders were helpful and very friendly. After we finished we were seated out on their deck overlooking their seating out on the lawn and the beautiful cove.
Dinner was fantastic. We both had seafood. Everything was terrific, service, food,drinks, atmosphere, and the weather!
Enjoyable ride back to Portland on a warm summer night:-)"
2547,"There is indoor, deck and lawn seating (I recommend the deck tables,  closest to the ferry pier).  Went with a group and had a very pleasant and efficient server (I'd request Andre next time instead for a little more pizzazz). Food is definitely delish. I'm not normally a dessert person but tried a friends triple layer mousse and it's divine!"
2548,Oh my. I have tasted fried clams from Cape Cod to Camden. Diamonds Edge has the best fried clams hands down! My order was only an appetizer but the portion was way larger than expected.
2549,"We kayaked to diamond cove from peaks island so there was a bit of an adventure getting here. Meaning high expectations and we were not disappointed. 

We were seated on the lawn w spectacular view of the small marina. Angel hair pasta with pesto, veggies and mussels and clams was perfect. My son ordered an ""edge burger"" cooked with pork belly (fancy bacon). He liked but it was a little too rich. His friend got the steak frite and said it was full of flavor and really enjoyed the caramelized onions. 

Overall great at the 4 star level."
2550,"Ate there this past weekend. What a treat. Took the 20 minute ferry ride out of Portland to the island. Great way to start the dinner experience. Arrived at the restaurant and was seated outside on the grass overlooking the cove and marina. Wait staff was very attentive. Food was excellent. Did not have time for dessert in order to make the next ferry home, otherwise would have had to wait another 90 minutes til the next one.

Highly recommended restaurant."
2551,"Fabulous view and experience of 'getting there' - whether you arrive by private boat or Portland ferry.  However..... This food is extremely overpriced for what it is.  I had fish and chips, fry oil used was definitely old and French fries skinny string fries - not crunchy and were unsalted.   Others in party said their food was 'okay.'  I am spoiled by great foodie places in Portland so Okay doesn't cut it for me anymore, especially when paying $15-20 for lunch."
2552,The nicest food and service I've had on my trip to Portland. Accompanied by a breathtaking setting.
2553,"I'm quite surprised that this place only has one other review, with its elaborate and secluded atmosphere, I cannot compare this place to any other. The only way to this restaurant is by riding a ferry from the port. The ferry ride itself was very cool, we caught the sun set along the coast creating a picturesque heaven. There are no words to what the scenery is but magnificent.

As we arrived and walked to the restaurant, you can see the place within minutes. I wold highly recommend bringing bug repellant cuz those suckers smell fresh meat for miles. We were seated outside, not sure if that is the norm but it was quite radiant. They started us with fish chowder which is nothing to brag about. But I did enjoy the main course, lobster bake which was delightful. 

I do have to say that the staff was hit or miss, you have the nice cute waitress who met all needs to the bread czar waiter who said they ran out of bread. Seriously never in my life have I been told that there was a shortage of bread, come on we are only miles from civilization. But the lobster was too delish to spoil the evening. Highly recommend coming here if you are visiting Portland, best part of the trip overall. From the ferry ride to the entree, it was a unique and great experience.

One more positive point is the bar, the bartenders at this place are quite generous especially when there is a shortage of drinks after serving more than 60 patrons at once."
2554,"We were very excited to take a visiting friend of ours to Diamond's Edge for lunch on Sunday 08/10/2014.  What a complete disappointment for the 9 of us.

Service:  I am not going to say it was the worst we have ever experienced, but it ranks in the top 5 worst.  The restaurant was not crowded yet it still took 15 minutes to put our drink orders in.  We did not even get menus until 30 minutes in.

Food:  If the food is great you can tolerate bad service.  Unfortunately the food was equally as bad.  We ordered seafood chowder and clam cakes to start.  The seafood chowder had very little seafood in it, and was very bland.  The clam cakes were edible but nothing special.  Most of us ordered lobster rolls with fries.  We also ordered lobster garlic smashed potatoes.  20 minutes after we ordered the waitress let us know they had no potatoes!  Our only option was a side salad.  In fairness one person ordered fish and chips and did receive fries.

The whole experience took soooo long we almost missed the ferry back!  We certainly understand things happen that are beyond control.  However, Diamond's Edge made no attempt to make the situation right.  In fact we all discussed what a burdened we seemed to be to their staff.

We recently moved to Maine from Texas and thought this would be a perfect place to bring visiting family and friends during the summer.  It has fallen so short that we will never return..."
2555,"Had dinner here last night in a party of about 20 people. The staff was attentive - they even went out of their way to find special deserts for my kiddos! The seafood chowder was some of the best I've ever had, and the seasonal soup (tomato and red pepper) was also yummy. The lobster with potatoes and corn were perfect while sitting on the deck with a view of the bay. Everyone else enjoyed their steak and salmon as well. Overall it was a lovely dinner and great dining experience!!!"
2556,"I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars because it's in what has to be a perfect setting. The view is gorgeous over looking the ocean and the grounds of Ft McKinley and the service was excellent. We ordered the salmon with quinoa salad. It was very good but the piece of salmon was 2"" x 2"" on top of a matching 2"" x 2"" block of quinoa salad. Nothing else was served. The piece of cake we ordered to split--blueberry cake--was very small with 3 blueberries on the side of the plate. We were all starving when we left the island!"
2557,"This is a four star restaurant that fell short when i came. I was reading the reviews online and was a bit pessimistic, but soon realized that the bad reviews were from a long time ago and the good reviews were recent. When I walked in I was surprised! It was nothing like the reviews said. Past reviews said it was a bad place to eat and look but it really was quite beautiful. They had us seated outside by the bay and it was very nice. The menu was good, but not too big. It had about 20 items. I ordered a shrimp cocktail and a 8 ounce steak. I then got some pineapple juice and really enjoyed my shrimp and drink. When my steak came I was really happy and ready for it! I thought I was going to be giving this a 5 star review to help balance out the bad reviews. I saw my steak and dug in. I was immediately disappointed as I had asked for a medium rare steak more on the rare side. It was fully cooked through. Not a single bit of pink. You may think I am under rating these guys just cause of a bad steak but I really like my steaks, like a lot, so when I noticed they messed up one of the easiest things to do (put it on a grill for the RIGHT amount of time) I was very sad. The steak dos taste good besides the fact that it was OVER cooked. I hope to give this place another chance but I will be very blunt about my past experience to make sure I get the steak I want."
2558,"This is a must-see restaurant.  What could be more romantic than ferrying to a remote island off the Portland coast for dinner?  The scenery is breathtaking and the ambiance is amazing. I see why it's a top wedding destination. My night consisted of taking 2 chairs to the edge of the water and sipping Vueve Clicquot  while enjoying the view.  It was amazing. The staff propped the champagne bottle on ice right next to us on the ground to accommodate us. After enjoying the view, we moved to the porch for dinner.   The lobster was amazing, best ever.  The mussels were also very good. My guest didn't really enjoy the lobster pasta.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience, top on my list.  And, I'd visit Diamond's Edge the next time I'm in Portland."
2559,"This is a wonderful place!  Take a picture perfect ferry ride out to Great Diamond Island and enjoy fine dining.  Indoor and outdoor seating available and they typically offer two seatings per evening.  Food is always very good.

How often do you get to go to an Island off of the Maine coast for a great meal?  Had our rehearsal dinner there years ago and fell in love with the place.  The waitstaff is great, very accommodating and they can get you in and out in time for the next ferry.  Or, stick around, miss the ferry and enjoy your desert and wine.  Catch the next ferry, enjoy the fresh saltwater air and enjoy a perfect end to the evening..."
2560,"What a disappointment!  Poor food and worse service. My seafood chowder was mediocre in taste and not nearly warm enough. My scallops and pasta were inedible! I asked the waitress to be sure that my scallops were cooked through. They weren't. My wife sent hers back (something she never does), but when they were brought out again they *still* weren't cooked through. The waitress didn't bother to refill water glasses that were empty. ... Nice setting to be sure, but at these prices it's inexcusable to have bad food and service."
2561,"Arrived at 6:30, departed on the 9:15 ferry, and did not have time for dessert?  Something is wrong with this picture!

Not sure why everything took so long when we were there for dinner last week.  The patio was full, but the dining room was empty, so it wasn't all that crowded.  35 minute wait for a bottle of wine, 60 minute wait on salads, no suggestion of another cocktail while we waited 90 mins for the entrees to emerge.  The food was okay, but not worth the travel or the prices.  

On the plus side, the staff were very nice, and the bartender was able to get us a to-go cup for after dinner drinks so that we could make the ferry."
2562,"under the new ownership, the food has suffered enormously.  we had a large group dine on the deck which was a gorgeous setting, and the service was quick and friendly, but the food was surprisingly horrible, with the exception of the mussels and bruschetta.

several ordered the special salmon salad which consisted of two slabs of smoked salmon and a pile of arugula.  the scallops were seared on just one side and the shrimp tasted like it had just come out of the microwave.

i won't be going back unless i hear they have turned things around in the kitchen."
2563,"Food was fantastic, lawn seating with view looking out over ocean, can not be compared to anywhere else in Portland."
2564,"We came here today for the second time, this time for lunch. Before we came, we were expecting standard Mexican food- what we got was much better than that.

Everything was fresh. The salsa was made in house and was full of cilantro. The beans were tasty and flavorful. The table-side guacamole was out of this world. The staff are VERY nice and polite (I'm trans so I can't count on this everywhere).

In other words: Give El Rodeo a try. You won't be disappointed."
2565,"I would like to know in what universe does this food qualify as ""Mexican"" food. Yes, I read the ""About Us"" page on El Rodeo's official website. Juan Sanchez, I think it is adorable that you're able to fool the poor citizens of Maine into believing that this is what Mexican food tastes like, but gosh darnit I have I had enough!

I am from San Diego, CA which has an extremely large Mexican population and you know... With Mexico being RIGHT THERE. I have had real authentic Mexican food. The food here is some pathetic attempt of trying to bring Mexican food to the racially homogeneous state of Maine. This does not taste like Mexican food and I honestly have NO idea what these dishes are even trying to do. The burritos do not make any type of logical sense and why does the food taste like water? The food was absolutely disgusting and bland!

I've had it up to here with these bad ""Mexican"" restaurants in this city! What kind of sickly deranged man puts CORN in a California burrito?! That carne asada burrito is NOT a carne asada burrito! You've got to be kidding me!

I'm in severe need of intense therapy after trying the food here. Never again!"
2566,"I had heard mixed reviews of El Rodeo but after driving by it so many times - I just had to try it out. The man who greeted us and served us was very friendly throughout our entire experience. 

The restaurant itself is very large with tables and booth seating.  It's overall appearance was nice and clean.  The menu is extremely large - lots to read and look over!  

We were immediately served the most delicious chips and salsa (actually got two servings of them because they were that good!) For an appetizer, we had the El Rodeo Sampler which consisted of a few buffalo wings, 3 jalapeño poppers, 3 cheese quesadilla triangles and taquitos made with beef.  Also served with sides of guac, sour cream and a warm cheese.  The sampler was good!  

Onto the entrees: I selected the ""make-your-own-burrito"" and got my usual ingredients (rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato & cheese).  It was HUGE.  Probably the biggest burrito I've ever had. I had to eat it with a knife and fork because there's no way it could have been held!  Still, so very good!  My boyfriend had the carnitas - heaping portions including a side salad with guac, beans and rice.  He was satisfied!  

Overall, it was a great experience. The timing and service was wonderful.  I will definitely be going back!  Also - for you beer drinkers, they have those 32 oz. mugs for their draft beer which are also HUGE!  This place definitely doesn't skimp on their food or their drink!"
2567,"Holy crap I think I just found my new go-to taco place! I visited their website a while back and saw that they do a taco Tuesday special where you can get an authentic mexican street taco with a filling of chicken, chorizo, or carnitas for $2.50 each! In Maine, that's a steal. I've been meaning to try this place for a really long time, and I finally came around to it. I met up with my sister here and we both got two tacos- a chorizo and a carnitas for each of us. They came out super hot and my mouth started watering. Our plates came with little trays of salsas and limes as well. The chorizo was a bit saltier than I'm used to, but the carnitas was amazing! I ended up ordering two more carnitas tacos because they were so good. For four tacos, the total came out to $10.80. Would highly recommend this place if you want to try some authentic tacos! Reminds me of California tacos :))"
2568,Decent tex mex options. Huge portion sizes. Reasonable prices. Friendly wait staff. This is good but we will keep looking for other options.
2569,"It was a good, hearty, fresh meal with very friendly waiters. I would recommend for a family restaurant or perhaps takeout"
2570,"This is a review about real Mexican food not that TexMex stuff! This brand can be found in Va, NH and Maine. We used to dine weekly at the El Rodeo in Newington NH and enjoyed real Mexican food regularly. Unfortunately they abruptly closed. We next drove the half hour to El Rodeo in Concord NH only to not find the same true Mexican food. Seems the ownership and the food are not the same every where you see the sign.
Discouraged we drove the hour to South Portland, our last hope. Surprise it was about the same menu as Newington with our favorite table side guacamole, prepared to perfection with a little zip to it!! My Burrito an my wife's enchiladas were great. Try this restaurant and enjoy real Mexican fare."
2571,"Everything about this place is just ""ok"". The service is very impersonal but it is fast. I went to have a quick dinner with a friend after work and we got right in and seated very quickly. The sides of guacamole are actually quite large but it is not the best guacamole I've had. The salsa is watery and tastes more like tomato sauce than salsa. The chips are ok but under seasoned. I chose to get the enchiladas mexicana because it includes 4 enchiladas and I was planning to bring half home for my hunny. The whole meal was just meh- not flavorful at all. The cheese melted on top tasted like white American cheese- not what I was expecting at all. The rice was ok but, again, not seasoned well. Overall, it was ok for a quick meal but there are so many better Mexican restaurants in the area."
2572,"Do you want decent Mexican food? Then this is the place for ""big plate"" Mexican food. The complimentary chips are undersalted and the salsa is thicker than I expected. 

We opted for the table side guacamole. We said mild when asked for our spice preference and it was perfection. Perfect flavor and obviously incredibly fresh. Worth $8.99? For three people, it was. It's enough to share but not for more people. 

The main meals came. Street tacos were fine, but there are better at other places in town. The carnitas plate was the win. I got Ramon's Combo which is a lot of different options on one big plate. All good, but the beef for the taco lacked the flavor I was hoping for. The taquitos were great as were the two enchiladas. 

I'll go back when I'm looking for decent Mexican. It's tough to find this far from, well, Mexico. At least it wasn't like chain food at On the Border or Taco Bell. This mole sauce was legit."
2573,"Food was descent and good. The service was also good!  Not traditional Mexican food, but lets face it that is hard to find in Maine. I'd come back if I was in the area."
2574,"Qualifier, I have never been to Mexico and many have told me I have never had ""authentic"" Mexican food. With that being said, we really enjoy the food here.

First, they share a lot with Harbor Freights across the lot, but every time we have been here, there is plenty of parking. So that automatically gets a start for me, parking lot :)

Second, every time we have visited, we are greeted promptly at the door. Always with a smile. Sometimes I don't always ""hear"" the host/hostess, because I am too distracted by the many specials listed on the specials board next to the host stand.

We have been here at dinner and lunch and have never had to wait. Not sure if that is a good or a bad thing, but for me, it's good, because when I am hungry, I am not very patient :)

The complimentary chips and salsa arrive within seconds of sitting down. I love the chips, they are freshly made and are not too salty. The salsa is almost like a puree and I like it a lot, but if you are not a fan of cilantro, skip the salsa.  We always order the cheese sauce to dip the chips. It is delicious cheese sauce, just a plain creamy sauce, as it cools, it thickens and becomes even more delicious! Drink orders are filled pretty quickly. Try the margarita, they are pretty delicious and pack a punch as well.

Don't forget that you still have to order food! LOL It's easy to be distracted by the delicious chips and drinks.

The menu is pretty extensive, I can always find something that I am craving. Sometimes it is just hard to narrow down my choice. I order something different every time. I like to sample many different types of dishes, but I have to say, one dish that I have ordered more than once is the pork carnitas! YUM!!! So good.

Other items we have tried, their burritos, chimichangas and the quesadillas. All packed with filling and crispy and golden, with a buttery flavor....sooo good.

If you order an appetizer, like their delicious table side guacamole, delay ordering your main entrees, because the food comes out fast...LIGHTNING FAST! There is only so much room on the tables :)

When it gets busy, the servers can be a little slow to check back in for beverages, only because they are so busy. 
The beer selection is always disappointing, so I typically go with a margarita, although I did have a Dos Equis once. It was ok.

This place is definitely the place we go to for sit down Mexican food. It's never too crowded and never too loud, like the other places in this general area.

I recommend and I will also be back. Yum"
2575,"Service and food standards have diminished. Our final visit consisted of nonexistent waiter, young bus boy that literally dropped an app that spattered onto clothing. Never made eye contact and just walked off. Waiter was in genuine and didn't want to be bothered with questions regarding menu. Searched for him trying to get attention when there were several other staff chatting  standing around."
2576,"Um, to quote Dora: ""Delicioso!"" 
Thanks be to the God of all comfort for the comfort food that is authentic Mexican! I have been searching for so long for straight up Mexican food. Not some blanched neo-Mexican hipster take on Mexican food, but the real deal. The search is over (sung in the stylings of Survivor.) 

From the get-go we had a wonderful experience: immediately seated with warm chips and salsa that was exactly what I look for. Savory, garlicky, cumin-y. The waiter was very patient and his recommendations were spot on. The food and service was quick and perfection. The beans and rice were the best that I've had in Maine so far. Pricing was extremely reasonable, with our waiter giving me the lunch price even though it was a Saturday.
Coupled with my new obsession of feeding my micro biome as many prebiotics as I can, El Rodeo is my new fave...and I haven't even tried the tequila yet!  Ay adios mio!"
2577,"Cross-contamination city. Ordered the vegetable fajitas, made sure the server knew I was vegan, and had food allergies. Food came in halfway through eating it I found chicken in my fajita veggies. Left the rest untouched but became violently ill on the way home. Probably not a bad place for omni people but if you have special diet or allergies steer clear they are not careful with your food"
2578,"Ehhhhh ... that's all I got I actually remembered that we had eaten here a couple of years ago when I was working the conference . 

Being from Texas I guess I get good Tex next all the time but this was just bland . The cheese dip was good but the rest is just ok 

All three of us tried something different and same outcome .... just ok"
2579,"- low prices.
- the food portions are huge!
- the seafood & Mexican food was delicious.
- staff was funny & helpful.
- lots of seating options.
- great drinks."
2580,We stopped in here for lunch yesterday- we are new to the area and looking for some good Mexican food... this place did not disappoint. The food was incredible and so was the service. We very much enjoyed the margaritas and you must try the chili rellenos... delicious! We will definitely be back.
2581,"This place is my go to when I want Mexican food that is loaded with cheese. The food is consistently good, especially the table side guacamole, which I always partake in. I'd say I'm about 50/50 with eating in or taking out. Take out is usually pretty quick, unless they're busy and then you definitely have to wait awhile. Eating at the bar is always super quick in my experience, but the table service is hit or miss. There have been times my food comes out so fast we haven't even gotten our drinks yet, and there are other times I'm sitting around waiting and waiting just to get a water. I guess it all depends on how they're staffed. I do have to say though, the staff here are sooooo nice! They definitely make up for the hit or miss service with their pleasant and joking demeanors. Overall I do really enjoy this place and will be back again soon for my usual Burrito Carne Assad's with fresh guac!"
2582,"Went here for lunch today and had a great meal.  So far, this is probably near the top of the list for Mexican restaurants in Portland.  The chips and salsa, fajitas, and drinks were all good.  Staff was friendly and location in a good spot.  If looking for Mexican, give this place a shot."
2583,"Hooked up with a couple of friends and this has always been a solid staple restaurant. 

When I arrived (I few minutes early) I was quickly seated and started on free chips and salsa. Would like a deeper bowl for the salsa. But they are always willing to refill. 

While waiting for my Pacifico to arrive I was enjoying the guitar music, which was not sure if it was live or taped. But enjoyed the Mexican version of Piano Man!

My friends arrived and we started with our drinks and enjoyed conversation and chips. 

We ordered our food (fajitas and taco plate with rice and beans.). I swear it took less time for our food than our drink orders. 

The taco dinner (chicken) is my usual choice and I am never disappointed. 

We hung out for around 2 hours and the server was very attentive to our needs!

Thanks"
2584,"Let me begin this review with a disclaimer: The staff were excellent, especially our server, Burhan. Very friendly, very personable, checked in on us the perfect amount, a good guy, and an asset to the establishment.

Now, the review.

My friend and I both ordered Jalapeño Margaritas. Mine was excellent. She didn't like hers, said it was salty. Not the rim, the actual drink. I tried it. It tasted like ocean water with a hint of lime.

The second red flag was the salsa. I told my friend that it tasted pretty fresh. She told me it was just the cilantro. I realized it was.

Our other friend arrived, and we ordered food. I got 5.99 cheese dip that tasted like filmy microwave velveeta.

Then the entrees.

I got chorizo con huevos, one of my friends got empenadas, and the other got carnitas. All were served with the same awful tasteless uncle bens rice and slightly filmed over refried beans on the side.

My dish was edible, but for much less, I could've bought a carton of eggs and some nice local chorizo and made it myself.

My friends carnitas were absolutely tasteless, soft, and full of fat.

My other friend's empenadas were cold and also tasteless. It's like nothing here was seasoned.

We paid, left 20% because of the solid service, and got out as fast as we could.

Bottom line: Avoid at all costs. Don't go here. This place has the audacity to have $30 entrees on the menu. This food is light years away from both authenticity and taste. I am honestly shocked that this place has so many positive reviews. It's basically a Mexican Applebee's. That said, if you're in the area and in the mood for trash food, just go over to On The Border or Margaritas. At least they're honest about what they are."
2585,"Three words say it all for my family:  table side guacamole.  Add the homemade chips and voila-- Mexifood magic. The menu is rich with family specials and traditions. This family run restaurant is terrific. Friendly hosts, timely wait staff. In the area?  Make El Rodeo a top choice."
2586,"Super friendly service, the waiter was funny and nice. Nice ambiance, nice music and decor. Portion size - large price - low price for the amount of food. Food quality -really good. Quick service."
2587,"Shrimp tacos tonight. Again, fast,friendly service with excellant food. This is our family favoriteloop"
2588,"Service was average, food was so good!!!!! Definitely save room for desert! The fried cheesecake is so good! We did wait a while for refills and our food but the food is worth it."
2589,"El Rodeo was great! The food was fresh and delicious, delivered on time and the portions were great! The meals even came with side salads. They could have given a few more napkins but otherwise - tasty greatness!"
2590,"It's a mall restaurant. I know. But you know what, this place is AWESOME!  I have been here twice and each time I have been very happy with my food, my drinks, and my service. It's the trifecta.

I grew up in a town that was largely Puerto Rican and Mexican. I was accustomed to some of the finest rice and beans, burritos, and Tex-Mex a midwestern girl could get.  This reminds me of the Tex-Mex days of yore.  This isn't traditional Mexican food, it's an Americanized version and as long as you know that going in everything will be A-OK.

El Rodeo takes me back to my roots. It's not insanely expensive, the servers are all super friendly, the portions are large, you get chips immediately upon arrival with homemade salsa, and sometimes there is live music! In the summer months there are tables on the front porch (granted the tables are looking out onto a busy mall road, but this also takes me back to my midwestern roots).

What really gets me are those frozen margaritas. I'll say it again the frozen margaritas.  Try this place out once and you will want to go back."
2591,"Loved it!! If you know your way around Mexican Food and love love love Habanero's tell them! They keep the home made awesome sauce in the back!! And try everything you will love it!! Oh and for those   that don't know Quesadilla already comes with cheese, lol!! And Chorizo is served scrambled!!! Great food and great atmosphere, come and enjoy real Mexican food!!"
2592,While visiting Maine we were excited to find a Mexican restaurant. El Rodeo did not disappoint! The chips were warm and the salsa was some of the best salsa I've ever had. We ordered fajitas for two and they were delish! We will definitely be back when we pass through Portland again!
2593,"Not sure how this place got a four star rating on Yelp. It's mediocre at best Mexican food. I ordered the Carne Asada, a 10oz steak with refried beans, avocado salad, rice and corn tortillas. 

I doubt I even ate half of the steak and truly doubt it was 10oz. I think they made a mistake because it was maybe ten inches in circumference. Slight error aye?! It was incredibly thinly cut down the center with a lot of fat, I cut it off. The avocado salad was a teaspoon of avocado at best over lettuce and the rice was over cooked and bland. The refried bean weren't anything great either. The best part was the freshly diced jalapeños on the side I asked for directly. 

I had to ask for a napkin and then silverware but it wasn't just me, the bartender pretty much ignored everyone. He didn't even ask how my food was or if I needed anything else. I hadn't eaten all day so I just ate three tacos from what I could salvage on the plate and paid my bill.  

Would not return here again EVER and would strongly suggest seeking other options. 

Portland is supposed to be a foodie town but this was extremely disappointing. Moving on the other areas of Portland."
2594,"My first Mexican food ever when I first visited the US a few years ago. It was the best then and still the best now. The food is always fresh. The service is always great. The place is always clean and the atmosphere is just jolly and happy. The workers are so polite and genuinely kind. 

I don't know if the food is authentic Mexican or what but whatever it is sign me up for more. This is probably my favourite restaurant I've been to. I love this place so much!!!!!

Would give 10 stars but had to settle for 5. Please relocate to MA so I can come here every day."
2595,Yummy! Service was kinda slow but food was great! The Blood Orange Marg was very tasty! And you have to get the guacamole!
2596,"The food is really good. Guacamole and queso are very tasty. Service is also super fast even when packed, and servers are very friendly."
2597,"The food is average in my opinion, but what makes this place stand out from some of the other Mexican restaurants around is the table service guacamole cart. They go to your table and make a batch of guac right in front of you in a Molcajete (stone bowl used to make traditional Mexican salsas etc)."
2598,Guilty pleasure Tex mex that is always good. Margaritas are just as delicious as their food. Servers are always so nice.
2599,"This is a pretty decent Mexican restaurant. Be warned, their menu is pretty large and they offer allot, but we enjoy that they have pictures with allot of their dishes, so we just point and say, I want that, lol! They can get busy on the weekends, but worth the wait and service may be a little slow due to the ""busy ness"", but we really don't mind that, besides, isn't that the reason to go out - relaxing, taking a breather, enjoying the food and the company your with!?! So, don't expect to sit, eat and leave quickly here..take your time and enjoy. They have a guacamole cart too, if you like yours fresh and they will prepare it for you, right at your table. I would love to have them do that, but my husband isn't fond of guacamole, but neat to watch another table have it done. I like the atmosphere here too, again nice music, nice servers, delicious food, the right lightening, to me, it is a relaxing place to get awesome Mexican food. I also found out recently that they have a food truck! They were at an event in Freeport and the only food truck that showed up for the relief effort of the hurricane that recently happened down south. All I can say is, Wow!! The Mexican steak wrap I had was huge!! Sorry, I can't remember the name of it, but it was oh so yummy!! So if you see their food truck around, definitely stop by and grab a bite, you won't be disappointed. Overall, this was our 2nd. time coming here and we are very pleased with everything and look forward to going back. Oh yeah, I also tried their Bahama Mama drink and it wasn't ""skimpy"" on the alcohol taste, so they are good on their drinks, too!!"
2600,"They make the best guacamole in town! Hands down. They make it right in front of you. We had the spicy version , which had fresh avocado, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions and tomatoes. Unfortunately, the excitement ends with the guacamole. I had the combination meal which included the chicken  chimichanga, chicken burrito and pinto beans. Everything was salty. My friend had the mole panchero and that was salty as well. Not sure if it was just a bad day. I'm willing to give them a second chance."
2601,"This is a little deceiving restaurant. It looks like a chain but it isn't. It is in the Shadow of Sea Dog in Portland but the food here shines. Very flavorful meals and the chips and salsa are excellent. The serving sizes were appropriate and the prices were very reasonable.  We had American tacos, fajita salad, kids burrito, a fajita quesdilla, and chicken mole. All were Delicious! I wish we had this restaurant in CT. It'd be my go to eatery..."
2602,"Pretty GOOD table-side guac (~$8). They use 2 avocados and prepare it with cilantro, lime and salsa in front of you. The finished guac is plenty to share with 3 other people as an appetizer and comes with chips. I'm not sure if i'll order it again b/c of the price, kinda steep for guac. 

Original or strawberry margaritas are $5 from 8-10pm. They're called 'Jumbo' margaritas but I consider them regular sized. Still not bad for $5. You can choose to have them rimmed with sugar or salt (I prefer sugar). 

OH! They have unlimited chips and salsa for FREEEEEEEEE! 

I heard they have live music and taco deals on Thursday nights - I'll definitely come back some time to check this out. 

Ample parking, good service and spacious restaurant."
2603,"I've been here a few times now, and every time has been a great experience. The margaritas, chips and salsa/cheese dip (if requested for 5.99), and service is wonderful. It's hard to find such a great authentic Mexican restaurant in this area, but this one is by far my favorite that I've ever been to. The staff is so friendly, they make conversation and always make sure you have full drinks. I always feel so welcome when I come here. The entrees are absolutely wonderful as well. If you're looking for a great authentic Mexican restaurant in the South Portland/ Southern Maine area, you won't regret making a visit to El Rodeo!"
2604,The food here was exceptional. Tasty and authentic. Mondays and Tuesdays there is a great 5.99 lunch special. I highly recommend the tableside guacamole. The food came out so much quicker than expected and was great quality
2605,"Today was my granddaughter's 16th Birthday. A few days ago..I called the Manager of El Rodeo and explained that we wanted to have a little family birthday party for my granddaughter today. They have two patios and we wanted to use one of them for our party. We had 10 people. With no hesitation or question, he said sure. Asked me about the time and I told him around 4:30 /5:00. He said no problem. I asked if we could bring a few decorations and a cake and again, he said yes without questioning or hesitating in the least. He said he would save the patio for us. Today I had to change the time until an hour later but he was ok with this and thanked me for letting them know. When we got there..the tables were already set up and our waiter was setting up with chips/salsa/drinks. He was very nice and complimented the Birthday girl, stood by as we sang Happy Birthday, was spot on with service, went above and beyond several times..had them sing Happy birthday to us in spanish! to the delight of everyone. Was just as excited as we were when Destiny opened her gifts and mentioned how awesome the cake was several times. We gave him a big piece for himself and the leftever cake for the rest of the crew there. (Hope they all liked it! :) ) He was great and patient and didn't seem to mind that we were there quite a long time..probably 2 1/2 hours at least. He was just incredible. Told Destiny's Dad that he had a beautiful daughter (in a very respectful way), and was beyond reproach. All in all..we had a wonderful time and due to this waiter and this restraunt's awesomeness..it was made even more incredible for our Destiny. 

I would like to say thank you to the manager and all the crew and especially our waiter for making this a perfect little Birthday Party. The food was awesome (as always!), the service perfect, the prices reasonable, and the weather was good too! 

I might also mention that they did not charge any additional fees for us having our party there and taking up the entire patio. On a Saturday even! This place is beyond perfect! I can't say thank you enough. :)"
2606,"I am going to be completely honest I was totally surprised by this mexican style chain restaurant in South Portland.

We stopped on Independence Dat this year while the rain was coming down and the sun was not being friendly with us (I know I know nothing says Americana like eating Mexican food but, the family was a hankerin' so we went a eatin')

The decor was clean on the outside with a large horseshoe bar to make the ambiance in the bar a friendly and inviting atmosphere and it seemed that the margaritas were flowing like a river but they were large and in charge.

The bathrooms needed some assistance in cleanliness where former patrons did some bad things in there.  But I think with the amount of people pouring in and the staff not expecting it on the fourth, they seemed a little understaffed.

The booths were a little tight and with the amount of food that they served, I am surprised but the food is what helped to seal the deal for us.

There is endless chips and salsa although the salsa is fresh and you can really taste the hint of cilantro, it wasn't chunky enough for my taste, was more like a watery yet tasty treat.

The combo platter I ordered was divine and delicious.  I got the enchilada, chimichanga and the delicious cheese quesadilla with a side of black beans and spanich rice.

My wife dove into the lunch fajitas with both chicken and beef and she said it was delicious and my son dove into a grilled cheese (there is your americana) with a hard beef taco and some spanish rice.  All of these items only rang in at about 32 dollars ... great deal ( with the below mentioned guac also ;))

The one great thing about this place i the curbside serving of the fresh guacamole.  I am really picky with my guac and this was some of the best guac I have had.  Packed with flavor and spice but still had just the right amount of chunkiness to give great texture.

Waitstaff was very attentive for what he had to deal with and the amount of people pouring into his bar but he did the best he could.

We will be back again on another day.  Really good time here at El Rodeo."
2607,Food was delivered quickly and was very good!  Will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
2608,"Wait wait wait...how is this any less than five stars? From anyone? 

If you live east of Texas, then you're not accustomed to proper Mexican food. That's no big deal. 

But if you are from a border state and are now living in the northeast, you will immediately understand that EL RODEO IS THE CLOSEST THING TO AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD YOU'RE GONNA FIND! 

All of our dishes were fantastic. And authentic. The service was impeccable (lunchtime on Sunday), the wait staff all actually spoke Spanish, and the place was cheery and clean. 

This is our new favorite Mexican food place in the Portland area. And if you know what Mexican food really means, you'll probably leave with the same conclusion. It's not the Mexican we Southern Californians are used to...but it's the best we're going to find up here (which is to say, it's awesome)."
2609,"Best Mexican food in Portland.  I judge my Mexican restaurants by their carnitas.  If they don't have them, I'm not impressed.  El Rodeo has 2 types!  Also, as with great Mexican food, food is always served quickly and the vast menu would take years to try every option.
Try it, you'll love it."
2610,We are huge fans of this restaurant for lunch takeout. Our staff at Redbank Village and Liberty Commons loves the food and atmosphere. We have worked with El Rodeo as well to provide discounts and specials to our resident.
2611,This place was pretty great! The food was yummy and the servers were nice and helpful.
2612,"The food as usual was fresh,  locally sourced and cooked to perfection. The service is always excellent. A restaurant that shouldn't be a secret - I'm spreading the word!  Thank you for such great Mexican food in a location that typically offers mediocre restaurants.  They also offer catering!!"
2613,"Not a place I would return to although based in reviews, other people were very happy with their meals. The restaurant is in fair enough shape and decorated appropriately. We were seated quickly and asked what we would like to drink without a chance to look at the drink menu so we asked for a few minutes. The blood orange margarita and the classic margarita were ordered and very good but we ordered our food at the same time and the food came before the drinks. Less than ten minutes. The food was disappointing- I had shrimp chimichangas which consisted of Two chimis fills with about 5 shrimp which were then covered with a veleveeta type sauce accompanied by salad and rice. My husband had a chicken taco salad with no guacamole and came out covered in guacamole. He sent it back while we waited another ten minutes. He said it was good though. Finished off the meal with fried ice cream which was on par."
2614,"Super good, spicy house hot sauces.  Excellent service.  Very nice selection of dishes on the menu.  Next time I'm in Portland, I'll be heading here first thing."
2615,I enjoyed the food here and the jumbo margaritas are awesome. They also have live music.
2616,"I went there for lunch. Just one person, sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly enough, but very quiet and seemed rushed. I noticed he forgot two other people's beverages, even after they asked. 

Anyhow, not too busy for lunch, but the food wasn't great. The chips were OK, but the salsa was very watery and bland. 

I ordered the three taco meal with Mexican rice and re- fried beans. The beans and rice were spot on. The tacos however were not. They came wrapped in tin foil, fine I suppose. I ordered chicken and received hamburger. I told the bartender and got an apology, but I still ate then, whatever right? The tacos themselves, tasted like Taco Bell. Not very impressive. 

The price is fair, but I'd say avoid the tacos. The staff was otherwise friendly."
2617,"Walked in on a Sunday evening, knowing that the choices in the area were limited.  This is a huge restaurant, with dozens of booths and tables and numerous servers moving quickly around.

Immediately we were provided complimentary (warm) chips and salsa, which were fairly tasty and had a deep cilantro flavor.  Could have been a bit thicker - and they should have filled the small bowls -- but overall an acceptable salsa service.  

Table-side guacamole was freshly made and fun to watch, and it's terrific to have a place in the area that still does it.  Fajitas (with soft corn tortillas, as we requested) were well made and not oily - flavorful and served piping hot.  Side order of the chile relleno was the table hit; so good we ordered another!  

Certainly, this is an Americanized version of a ""Mexican"" restaurant, designed to satisfy the typically weak American palate.  However, we found the menu items we ordered to be well above average and thoughtfully made.  I'm now a believer in this place, and I'm looking forward to coming back!"
2618,"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. Definitely worth it, down to the rice and beans. The Texas fajita was awesome. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. I had the chicken enchilada combo with rice and beans. The trio dip appetizer was good too! The queso dip reminded me of Mexican crema just heated up. But it was tasty."
2619,"I've been on a streak with restaurants lately! I have discovered my new favorite Mexican joint, and it's El Rodeo in South Portland. I first discovered these guys through their food truck (which is awesome), and couldnt wait to check out their sit down place. The decor is standard Mexican restaurant decor, and the outside makes it look like a generic chain restaurant. What makes this place special though, is the attention to detail with customer service and their menu. Our waiter was extraordinary, always very pleasant and accommodating, and the food was a step above the rest. Featuring nothing out of the ordinary (though their menu is more substantial than most!), what makes the food better is the love that goes into the cooking. I had the chicken fajitas, and everything tasted fresh, with layers of flavor you just don't find at most generic Mexican restaurants. I can't wait to go back to explore the menu, and grab one of their huge margaritas!"
2620,"This is a good, solid American Mexican restaurant.  Good Hueveos Rancheros, lots of options for vegetarians.  Delicious salsa and chips.  Tableside guacomole making is a must, as are the margaritas.  Taco salad and burritos are full of crisp veggies and creamy beans."
2621,"I think everyone can sing that five dollar footlong song from Subway.  Instead of a subpar, soggy, gross sandwich...go to El Rodeo during happy hour and buy a margarita.  Now these aren't just any margaritas.  They are HUGE and heavy on the tequila but still delicious.  

They also serve food.  It is pretty good.  I personally am allergic to avocados, so I can't do the amazing guacamole, however our table ordered two.  These dishes were HUGE and I'm pretty sure he put three avocados in each one!!  You can also order it spicy, which was a huge hit at the table.  I personally had the queso fundido, which was well made but not AMAZING and the chimichangas.  

I really liked our server.  He was nice and didn't hover but our drinks were always full.  He put up with our large group and gave us separate checks with no eye rolling or grumping.  

Is this a fine dining restaurant?  No.  They aren't really shooting for that status.  This is a cool place to go after work and drink margs and maybe eat dinner if you don't feel like cooking that night.  I DO know that we are still talking about this at work today and we have plans to go back for our next monthly happy hour.  This might be THE new HH place!!  

FIVE! FIVE DOLLAR MARGARITA!!!!!!!!  


^^^also, I'm pretty sure they are only six dollars during NOT happy hour, but don't quote me.  :)"
2622,"Visited El Rodeo for the first time today when we happened to be in Portland. We will definitely go back! Everything was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. Crayons and coloring for kids with kids menu (extra nice bonus was that kids ate free today - Sunday, nfl special). Table side guac was tasty and truly not a bad price considering the large amount you receive. I had the house margarita which was ok but not great. I ordered the Jalisco burrito but with cheese sauce instead of red sauce; they didn't mind the substitution and I'm so glad I made that choice because it was just perfect cheesy porky oniony deliciousness. Note that it was about as big as my face. Soft delicious tortilla shell. So good. Kids meals were good portion. Husband got chicken burrito grande and was very pleased. Nice, clean, fairly quiet atmosphere. Give it a try!"
2623,"Yeah, I don't really care that it's ""not authentic"" (it IS Portland, after all -- not exactly the Mexican food capital of the world). I simply care that the table-side guacamole exists. Do yourself a favor and GET IT. It is fresh, made to a bespoke level of spicy for your dining pleasure, and just plain ol' delish. Plus, how fun is it to see someone smash up some avocados in front of you?

I ordered something a La Mexicana from the lunch menu, which was tasty and had a nice Scoville-worthy kick to it, but all I can think about (and remember with clarity) is that guac. Mmm. Guac. We ordered one for our table of five, and it was enough for us to enjoy it as an appetizer. If you have a larger party, you may want to put in two orders. Trust me, this ain't my first rodeo.

Overall takeaway? Get the guacamole. Enjoy."
2624,"One set of my parents love Mexican food, so after doing a little shopping at the Maine Mall, we decided to try El Rodeo (mostly I demanded that we check it out because I had heard about the table-side guacamole - and being a total avocado fiend - I wanted to see what this was all about).

La buena...
+ The never ending bowls of chips and very cilantro-y salsa.
+ The ""Late Night Happy Hour"" which is from 8 to 10pm and includes $3 16oz draft beer, $5 well drinks, $5 margaritas, $5 nachos.
+ The speedy turn-out with food.
+ The table-side guacamole. It's really what is most awesome about this place... you choose your heat, whether you want cilantro, and whether you want onions. It comes in this ENORMOUS vat and is EXTREMELY delicious (you know what makes it extra delicious? That you got to watch it being made so you know exactly what's in it, who touched it, etc.). I could have just eaten this for a meal with a margarita and been entirely satisfied... as a matter of fact, I regret not just following my instinct and doing this in the first place.

La mala...
- The building is enormous and feels impersonal like a generic Americanized chain. There's no personalization or intimacy here at all. As a matter of fact - no matter what aspect of this place I'm describing later down the road, ""generic"" will always be my go-to descriptor.
- The draft beer options are EXTREMELY limited. 
- The table-side guacamole probably won't be made entirely to your specifications. We asked for a bit of heat and no cilantro. Instead we got a bit of cilantro and absolutely no heat. I blame this on (segue)...
- The staff we dealt with seemed like they hated their jobs, they hated us for being there, and they hated themselves, too. The apathy rolled off them in waves; when customers have to do your job for you (ask for waters, peel the stickers off the lemons that came in the waters, remind you which drink/dish belonged to who, tell each other which plates were scorching hot so we don't burn ourselves because you forgot to, etc.), you are doing something wrong.
- The two meals I tried (my own, which was a vegetarian taco salad; and, someone else's spinach quesadilla) were HUGE disappointments. The taco salad was swimming in liquid from the vegetables, there was no cheese or beans, there was no seasoning, there was no flavor. Truth be told, I only ate a few bites before giving up on it and just eating the rest of the guacamole. The spinach quesadilla was overly spinachy and entirely bland - I also found it sopping wet, as well. Talk about SERIOUSLY underwhelming food.

This is a place for families who want big portions of familiar ""Mexican"" food (the stuff they probably make at home out of a box); but, it's not a place for Portlander's with a discerning palate who've come to expect a bit more from their cuisine.

Would I come back though?

'Chup. I still LOVE the table-side guacamole. Coming here with friends for the ""late night"" margarita happy hour deal and some of that 'cado dip (all for a whopping total of $13) seems like a bargain!"
2625,"So delicious, very authentic and great service!

Sat in the bar area for lunch. I got the acapulco which was so yummy. Was weighted on by the lovely bar tender! 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new, authentic restaurant with great food."
2626,"The meal I ordered was amazing! It was on the last page of the menu (not the back side) and it was two words J**** C**** can't remember the name of it! It's cheese sauce over shrimp, rice and vegetables! Makes my mouth water while writing this! I've ordered it the last 2 or 3 times I've gone and it's as good as the last! Everyone I know who orders it, loves it! Drinks are really good here as well. Best Mexican food around South Portland!"
2627,"This California girl is incredibly impressed! It's hard to find good food, that's made from scratch, has actual flavor from real ingredients and is delicious. To many restaurants cheat and say it's fresh out of the oven, or just baked, but what people don't realize is it came from a box in their freezer. 
If you want real food, from scratch and made by amazing humans this is where you want to go! The poblano relleno is one of my favorites!  My kids love the tacos and the burritos. Give it a try, it is worth it!"
2628,"The food that I had there was good, not great. It personally lacked some spice that I wanted, but overall was good. The empanadas were incredible, and the main course (taco/chimichanga) were good as well. As I said, the only thing lacking was spice for me.

Overall, it was a good experience and I'd visit again. Need to try the table side guacamole."
2629,"The food, drinks, and staff is solid enough to get a 4. This isn't super authentic mexican food by any means, but as far as family mexican goes you could certainly do a lot worse. 
They have some big solid margaritas (on the cheap) and fresh chips and salsa."
2630,"Happy Hour margaritas were 1) HUGE 2) Strong & 3) DELICIOUS

The food was good. Not phenomenal, but good for Maine Mexican-version foods. 
It's definitely more California-like Mexican food than Tex-Mex food. 

The service was, in fact, GREAT & the ambiance was great. 
As always, complimentary chips & salsa... and the salsa was good & mild..."
2631,"I am struggling to think of anything that I liked about this restaurant.  First of all, the food was bland.  From the tamale to the enchilada to the guacamole, nothing had any fire to it.  The sauce they pour over everything was a similar brown sauce.  It was nice to see a table-side service for the guacamole, and they do let you choose the amounts of your ingredients, so if I was every forced to return here, I will request a better mix of spices.  The rice was boring and had peas instead of green chili, the beans were a smoothy with very little taste.  Lastly the service was disappointing, even though the restaurant was not busy.  Pass up this place and try somewhere else."
2632,"As a person whose last name literally means ""The White,"" I'm perhaps not the world's most qualified Mexican Food Reviewer. That said, this is a solid choice. I visited at lunch time and we had our pick of seats. We immediately received a hearty serving of chips and salsa. ""Hearty serving"" is going to be a recurring theme here in fact. My michelada (the best adult brunch drink, IMO) was HUGE. Literally 1 liter of michelada. I just kept sipping it, but it felt like the liquid level never went down.

To eat: shrimp in a mojo garlic sauce for me. A bit pricey for lunch at, I believe, $14.99, but these were worth the financial hit for sure. The shrimp themselves were incredibly tasty, but what really stood out to me was the rice. Which is insane, I know, rice is rice right? Incorrect. This rice was something else. Vegetarians, I'm not saying this rice has pork fat in it, because I didn't ask, but this wasn't just regular rice. ""Guacamole salad"" was just that: some lettuce with a bit of guac on top. Meh. I'm not about to complain when everything else was tasty. The tortillas were the best tortillas I've had in Maine to date (an odd scale, I know, but it's what I have).

The mall-adjacent location was what brought me here in the first place, but I feel a little bad for El Rodeo that they're out here in the land of chains. It also makes 1 liter drinks hard when you've got to drive. Still, I'll be back. Probably the next time I need to go to pay my respects to the Targets and Nordstrom Rack's of the world."
2633,The food was SO GOOD. Loved the service and atmosphere (really fun music). How could you go wrong with nacho cheese and strong drink?
2634,Food was OK only.   Service was full on amateurish.  The waiter was nice but a bit weird on the service.  We asked for more water for the two of us and he brought out one additional glass of water?  He did this twice.  Ordered three taco's and got four (also charged for four).   Needed to ask for Salsa and the check....
2635,"Donna P needs to revisit this restaurant.  I visited and thought my Burrito was yummy and the guac (table side) huge and satisfying.

Thanks El Rodeo,

2636,"I had read other Yelp reviews and heard good things about this El Rodeo from friends.  While in South Portland we decided to try this out.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The food was far better than other Mexican restaurants in the area and the menu options were extensive.  We started with jumbo margaritas and guacamole made fresh at our table.  We were able to select the ingredients and the spiciness.  It was great..and the warm tortilla chips made this even better.  Even with all the menu options I was talked into customizing my burrito so I could have carnitas.  It was amazingly good.  The cheese sauce was simply to die for...I could barely finish half!

The service here was spectacular.  You can tell they truly love and take pride in their job, service and food.  We learned that many of the servers moved here to work at this restaurant.  It really says a lot about the dedication of the staff...this is something you do not see often!

Our entire family loves Mexican food and we look forward to bringing the kids here to check it out!"
2637,"We discovered this place on a friend's recommendation. We went in on a friday for Happy hour and though it was busy we got seated with in about 5 min. The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly and the $5 margaritas are strong! 
The highlight is definitely the fresh guacamole cart made ready to order at your table. The food cam out quicker then expected -Which of course made us think -""great 3 day old frozen pre-made food  -joy"" but to our surprise it wasnt -and it tasted great!!
The resturaunt was crowded but not load, great time -can't wait to go back with friends!"
2638,"6 STARS. I'm from San Diego, and Mexican food is my weakness. This, and Taco Trio are the only 2 places I get my Mexican on. Love everything"
2639,"If I had gone alone, I would have given El Rodeo a solid 4 stars, but my wife was not thrilled, so as a party, it wasn't a runaway hit.

With the atmosphere, they're going for an upscale-ish feel, but it's a rather ordinary space with standard wooden booths and a chain restaurant-type setup (think Applebee's but without the chotchkies). This wasn't a problem for me; just a little strange.

Our server was polite and on-the-ball, but pretty shy and not all that engaged with us. She did crack a smile a couple times when my toddler said ""hi"" to her, but beyond that she was stoic.

The chips and salsa were good. We drained the salsa quickly, and they refilled it.

We went for the fresh guacamole prepared table-side, expecting it to be fun to see it prepared, and have it be worth the $8. It was actually kind of...depressing?...to watch the person make it. This person, too, was stoic and detached, and instead of it being fun we sort of just talked and waited for her to finish. The guac itself was good, but could have used some more zest. Not worth the $8.

My wife got some enchiladas, and they were attractive but bland. She thought the sauce was too sweet and was generally underwhelmed.

I got the Fajitas Parrillada. and it was fantastic! It arrived sizzling and steaming. The tortillas were warm and chewy, and all the meat, veggies, and beans it came with were awesome. The rice, however, wasn't. It looked like it might have been a bit old and reheated or something. Not bad, just not great.

My daughter got a kids taco, and it was on the small side, and served with the same meh rice that came with my meal. Again, underwhelming.

So, as a party, it was a mixed bag, but I was super-happy with my meal, personally. I'd like to go back, but my wife doesn't feel motivated to do so. Maybe I'll give it another shot with someone else someday."
2640,"Seriously Yelpers...how do none of you know the difference between Authentic Mexican Food and Tex-Mex (I can understand Mainers making the mistake...but CA and TX)? El Rodeo (along with Margarita's and On The Border) is a Tex-Mex restaurant. 

I have had the privilege of eating at El Rodeo since I was 12 years old.  How you ask?...El Rodeo opened its first location in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (which is where I am from).  I was lucky enough to get to eat their awesome food when I grew up.  Low and behold the first location that they have outside of central PA is...South Portland, ME. Awesome!!!

El Rodeo has awesome Tex-Mex fare and drinks.  The chimichanga and fajitas are fantastic!"
2641,"Being Hispanic, I take my Mexican foods very serious so I tend to be a little more stricter on how I judge the food. I had heard a few of my coworkers rave about the drinks here and the food being good; but this came from two guys who took there drinking SERIOUS. So I had to decipher if the food was actually good or if they were just getting drunk and didn't know right from wrong when it came time to eat.
     Went here on cinco de mayo; Off the bat I liked the atmosphere and everyone that was staffed appeared to be Mexican and I could hear Spanish being spoken among the staff. This is always a great sign as it makes you feel like it's authentic. Ordered the table side quac along with nachos and a plate of rice/beans/chicken with a soft taco and taquitos. The table sized guacamole was excellent; make a long story short the food besides the guacamole was very generic; it didn't taste authentic at all very bland and can be compared to tortilla flat (not good). Could have been an off day cause they were so busy. 
     Also a note our servers first day was that..Cinco De Mayo just two hours before. She had to read the menu with us poor girl; I don't think that's fair to throw someone in first day of training on the busiest day of the year. Poor thing; hopefully she didn't quit that night. Overall I don't think I'll return I had high hopes but might be good to someone who isn't as strict as me regarding Spanish food!"
2642,Wow the food is so good!! Is abuela in the kitchen? The service is good too!! I highly recommend this place.
2643,"This place is unreal!!! The guacamole is made table side and is delicious ! The shrimp fajitas came with a ton of shrimp and were delicious.

The sweet waiter even put salt on the icy ground near our car so we wouldn't slip.

A++++++"
2644,"I went there on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed. The staff were running around but did a great job handling the large crowd.

The location and restaurant layout are really good. Plenty of parking.

The food I had was good but I saw a lot of things that I wanted to try.

I'll definitely go back when I'm jonzing for mexican food and try some other dishes."
2645,"Pure yumminess! We ate lunch here with co-workers. We always sit at the bar, the bar tender remembers us, and treats us like family! The food is very good, I have not ordered anything I did not like."
2646,"Lots to choose from. However, would give a higher review but the guacamole cart was gross and looks like it was never cleaned all day, when it should be cleaned every time (gross) asked for no quac or sour cream on my plate, and it did. (Gross). Waitress was nice and attentive but saw the crap on my plate but never offered to fix it."
2647,"This was my only visit here while in Portland , but I enjoyed my meal. Ordered cheese dip and fresh jalepenos to start . Large margaritas were $9.50 vs. the prices at another restaurant ($20-30). Had mixed fajitas with chicken and beef. Meal was very good and bar service was good. If I were going to be here longer, I would eat there again. Also have enough left for lunch tomorrow."
2648,Very disappointed in my food. I've been multiple times but this time around my food tastes different. Not very enjoyable.
2649,"This was my favorite place to go for Mexican, and still could be--however something needs to change with the waitstaff. The food is great. But the waitstaff no longer seem to care about getting orders correct, and seems reluctant to simply take a second to listen to what the customer truly wants and communicate that to the kitchen. I order straight from the menu, and I'm not picky. So my food comes out great. But with my husband, who is picky about what goes in his burrito is very close to never coming here again. We will try again---not for a good while--and if they get his order wrong, yet again, I'm afraid we'll just have to find a new mexican restaurant with waitstaff who actually give a flying hoot."
2650,"Have now visited this place multiple times and have met the young owner, Juan, several times.  He is always eager for feedback and is working to get it right.
On a recent Saturday night, decided to try something different...I am a guacamole addict and am happy to admit it....wanted some but not the huge tableside version.  I am happy to report that for 3.99 you get a nice cup of the same homemade guacamole, very creamy with a little kick.  If you want it customized, tableside is still the way to go but this is very yummy as a starter with chips while you scan the menu.
I had fajitas on my mind and had to have them.....these are some of the best I have ever had.  I wanted chicken and steak so we got the combo.  You can order it for 1 or for a few bucks more, a shareable size for 2.  Nice chunks of chicken and steak, sautéed with carmelized onions, peppers, and tomatoes.   I asked about the seasoning because it was very savory...Juan admitted it was mom's recipe and the carmelization of the onion,pepper and tomato are all that is needed.  I was seriously scraping my fork across the now cooled cast iron skillet and wondering if it would be too embarrassing to lick the plate.  It comes with flour tortillas or corn if you prefer. A nice side of the refried and garden greens with sour cream and salsa. ...fold and enjoy!
We were told that a new menu is in the works....and here is a sneak peak...they will have shrimp ceviche.  For any who haven't had it, it is summer on your tongue.  Traditionally, it is a raw fish, scallop, or shrimp that is ""cooked"" by a chemical reaction in a strong citrus broth....this shrimp version I had the privilege of sampling is made with cooked shrimp. The tomato, onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and spices are just right and the lime/citrus has the classic taste of a fresh made item.  As always,  the Margaritas are cold and refreshing.  There are some menu items that need a little tweaking and as I mentioned before, Juan is always open to constructive feedback and suggestions.  I love that fact.  Imagine going to a restaurant and being able to suggest to the owner how a little change to a dish can make a difference and actually have them listen.....having only been open for a little over a year, this place still has growing and perfecting to do.  At least it isn't another chain where change takes an act of Congress and you get your food the way it comes, not necessarily the way you want it.
Worth a trip just for the guacamole......"
2651,"Good food and drinks for the price. I've been here several times, both lunch and dinner. The fajitas are fresh and well-seasoned and the margaritas are good. The staff is very friendly. This is a good place for a reasonably priced night out with friends, good food and drinks, casual, relaxed atmosphere."
2652,I order online and it didn't show up till an hour and half later my food was cold and my order wasn't even right.  I call to check  on my food after waiting a hour they told me it's been ready just waiting for the drive so I know my food be just sitting there.
2653,"It was a ghost town here at 8 pm on a Friday night.  The service was excellent but the food was way too expensive for what you get . 

First the good: We were greeted warmly and sat immediately ( again there were maybe 10 customers in the whole restaurant)  the chips and salsa were fantastic and plentiful.  

Now the bad : Everything else . Our food took almost 40 minutes to come out and it seemed microwaved and tasted bland and salty all at the same time. To top it off the portion to price is way off . 

I came here about a couple of years ago and it seems I should of just stayed away.  I'm sad because I thought I was going to like this place . Asked the person I went with if they will come back and she said only for drinks and chips and salsa.  Me too I'm afraid."
2654,Chips and salsa was good. Food was mediocre. Midway through our food we finally had to ask for our drinks. We were there at lunchtime and they had prison break with people vomiting and being murdered all over the TV screens while we were trying to enjoy lunch. Felt a little creepy.
2655,"This place is amazing. It's Mexico in Maine. Totally authentic, huge portions that are sensational. The staff is incredible. Friendly, fun and entertaining. Skip the fast food, boring restaurants and dine here. If you like real burritos, tacos and fine Mexican cuisine, THIs is the place. I've never been here before but I'm coming back again  and again. Don't eat here and you're missing out."
2656,"I have a mixed review. 
They have a sister Restaraunt in Carlisle, PA which I have been to and was told it was the same family who was opening this one. 
We went opening week. The food was delicious, however, the servers outnumbered the customers by 5:1 so we had overly attentive service. That being said, out server couldn't remember what drinks we had for refills.. No biggie. 
Our next two visits there was something wrong both times... My husband ordered ground beef for his chimi both times and got sirloin. I asked for no cheese and got cheese (lactose intolerant). We ordered apps that never came but were charged for them. 
That said, the food is really good. It's not a typical chain place. I have friends who go here and love it and have never had an issue and know some of the servers."
2657,"My fiancée and I were unaware this place existed and we come to the area at least once a month. Guess since it's not on the main drag we totally overlooked it. 
The salsa and chips were ok but the guacamole made up for that. The guacamole cart is wheeled over to prepare the best guac I have ever had. Side note: I've tried lots of different guacamoles. Anyways, it was worth the 8 bucks since it's about 2 avacados worth and delightful. The main meal was great too. I got the fish taco which was baked fish unlike margaritas where they fry it. Even though it was a healthy version it was far superior. My fiancée got the Pollo Adodo which he stated was better than the other two family owned Mexican restaurants that we frequent.   Overall, awesome experience. 
I noticed some of the not so good reviews were a few months or more old and wonder if that is due to them still working out the kinks food wise and waitstaff wise. I would give it a try even if some of those older reviews make you think otherwise.
Check it out. It's worth your time, money, and full bellies."
2658,"We have long been curious about El Rodeo as we frequent neighboring places, so when a family member said they were in the mood for Mexican, this seemed like a natural choice since it's so close to our house. Let me just say, we made the perfect choice!! The atmosphere was great, the service was great, the drinks were great, the food was great and the prices were great!! Needless to say we are very happy and can't wait to return!"
2659,"I love margaritas and Mexican food. That's all there is to it. I decided to try this place after seeing several reviews from my yelp friends. It's simple food, quick and friendly service, and very strong drinks. I went around 11 am on a weekday. It wasn't very crowded and I was seated in the bar area. My waiter was very talkative and helpful with suggestions. I ordered a large, lime margarita and it packed quite the punch. (But for almost $10 it better be) Chips and salsa were provided free of charge and I ordered a small cheese dip as well. It was good but nothing special. For my meal I ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and they were delicious! Cooked perfectly with peppers and onions, served with the usual sides of rice, beans, and guacamole salad. The prices were very reasonable. I noticed several signs for late night happy hour specials and I'm sure I will be back to take advantage of them!"
2660,"Great Mexican food. Tableside guacamole is delicious, fresh, filling!  Any of the enchilada dishes are great, but Juan's enchilada are very tasty!"
2661,"Good Mexican food, tried taquila and thought it's normal food and turn into really awesome! The pepper jam is really hot. Service is nice and warm by Latin American guys."
2662,"I Have placed many order's from 2 Dine in, from El Rodeo, as well as pick up orders too, and I always am disappointed from the 2 Dine in order's, it is almost as if the restaurant cannot read or understand the request, they always have to make two-three trips back to fix the order, it is not the delivery service's fault it is the restaurant that does not pay attention to details, which are important whether eating in or dining out, the customer is always right, last time we gave them a try the meat was so fatty, it was inedible, my GF called and complained and they offered us our 62$ back, If I were a dine in customer like I have been many time's, never had a problem like that, seems they favorite eat in over, people that order out,Tired of restaurant's that do this, Fajita Grill in Westbrook runs circles around this place, El Guerarra too!"
2663,"My husband and I were looking for a Mexican place to eat with our teenage daughter and her friend, something affordable serving your basic Mexican fare like tacos and burritos. We were not looking for high-end gourmet Mexican, like Zapoteca. This fit the bill perfectly. The guacamole made table side was delicious. (However, it wasn't spicy enough for me. I wanted to order it hot, but my daughter wanted it medium. We ordered it medium and it wasn't spicy at all!) I got the burrito jalisco which was huge, and so delicious I ate it all! My husband had fajitas, which looked incredible, and which he said were really good. We had a child with Celiacs disease with us who could not eat any foods containing gluten. She had a chicken taco (hard corn shell) with rice and beans and seemed really happy with it. The best part were the servers, who all appeared to be Mexican, and were very warm and friendly, seating us at the booth we requested, calling us ""amigos."" 

We recently had a bad experience at On The Border, where a server would not seat us at a booth even though there were about 15 booths available, because he only wanted to fill tables in a certain section. He made us wait until one particular booth became available! Anyway, I told the server here at El Rodeo that I would never go to On The Border again!!!  El Rodeo was the best Mexican food I've had in the Portland area!

Oh, and one last, interesting tidbit: I felt bloated and sick for about a day and a half after I ate at On The Border, but I didn't feel sick at all after eating at El Rodeo, even though I ate too much. A little too full, but not sick!"
2664,"Last dinner before leaving Maine. Actually as a restaurant in airport, it exceeded my expectation. I got the lobster dinner and my friend got the lobster roll. Both were fair. I love how they have steamed veggies as side. Their slaw was also good and in big portion. We also tried the special beer on tap - pumpkin flavored. Good beer. 

What I don't like is the Bloody Mary with lobster claw in it. The flavor was ... emmmmm....... anyway I wasted 18 bucks on that cause I barely drank it. 

As the location is in the terminal it's def on a pricier side. Anyway still glad to have this as last dinner in Maine during our terrible flight delay to kill the time. Service was great."
2665,"Great wait staff. The water was good.

Lobster rolls were a sad send off. Had been looking forward to getting a lobster roll before leaving. While the roll was nice, and buying the big lobster roll meant I got a good amount of meat, they simply put undressed lobster meat on a bun that's be slathered with a minimal amount of dressing. The result was a lot of overpriced, flavorless lobster, and it was a waste. It probably looks good to tourists, but there's a reason you the meat with mayo or butter etc. two large lobster rolls and a side salad substitution, I'm out $72 before tip. Better to not fish for them at all if you're going to doo such a poor job preparing them. 

Sending people home after a visit to Maine shouldn't come with a really poorly done version of such a Maine icon, and the price adds insult to injury.

If you want to get a good lobster roll in Maine, you're already too late if you're at the airport. Sounds like an obvious truth, I know. Don't bother with this place."
2666,"From one who lives on Casco Bay and knows seafood: a thousand apologies for this travesty- at $32, the colossal lobster roll - 6 ounces of previously frozen bland tasteless lobster on a soggy roll with minuscule dressing is an embarrassment- the lobster-crab cakes at $26 are hardly any better-
Locals, like me, will never eat here again. Tourists- avoid!"
2667,"Pretty darn good for airport food!  

After a whirlwind 24 hour trip to Maine, I found myself in the Portland airport realizing that I had not yet had a chance to experience Maine's signature lobster roll.  A coworker said Linda Bean's was actually halfway decent, so I bellied up to the bar and ordered said lobster roll at ""regular size"" at ""market price"" as listed on the menu.  

My sandwich, chips, and coleslaw were delivered really quickly. 
 The lobster roll was solid.  Even though it was the smaller portion, I thought the serivng of lobster was pretty hefty, with nice claw pieces. The coleslaw was a little too sweet for this southern girl, and the chips were just okay.  If just the lobster roll solo were an option, that's what I would have done.  Of course, I'm sure this doesn't compare to what you can get at off-airport restaurants, but for a pinch, it was just fine.

 However, as I was eating, the patron next to me was talking to the bartender, and she informed him that they had off menu lobster roll specials, which included just one side item.  So, if you find yourself dining here, definitely ask about off-menu specials to save some money and just savor the good stuff!"
2668,Grabbed a bloody Mary and a cup of lobster bisque for the road :-) best lobster bisque I've had in a while :-) definitely better than I had at a restaurant on the Maine coast recently. This one is at the airport!  tCheck it out folks Yum Yum
2669,"This is a 2.5

It's become a ritual for me to come here before every flight, as my parents tend to drop me off with too much time before my flight (we live 1.5 hours away and they overestimate traffic!).

I went to Linda beans when it was in Camden, and it was certainly cheaper then. I didn't want to go this time because I knew I'd be too tempted to get a lobster roll and chowder, which would be way over budget for me.

I resisted the food urge but I got a $14 bottle of KORBEL sparkling wine. Ugh. KORBEL! Not even good. Service is always very good, especially at the bar, which has outlets (but it USB ports) under the bar. 

Linda Bean herself is a controversial figure in Maine; she was considered so even before the trump donation. She is certainly worth a google search."
2670,"I was on a very short layover here and had barley enough time but I wanted a true Lobster Roll from Maine. This was the best Lobster Roll I have had in Maine to date. The secret sauce is what truly made it for me. Of course the lobster was awesome too but the sauce and seasoning were especially fantastic. The market value for a Colossal Lobster Roll was $30 which was ok for how good it was. It also came with house made chips as a side. I got to enjoy it at 30,000ft in the air."
2671,"The only restaurant on this side (Delta) of the terminal. You seat yourself and the waitstaff take your order. I ordered the lobster melt and swapped the cheese for Swiss and got a soup. The sandwich came with chips pretty quickly but my soup never did. I ended up just hoping it wouldn't since I was full and when I got the check, saw it was never entered by the waitress (my gain.. I think).  Would recommend if you're hungry and want a proper dinner. If you're in a rush, eat at BK right next door."
2672,"I really wanted to like this place especially being a huge supporter of all things Maine. Ordered the crab sandwich. Nice presentation, but not enough crab to flavor the sandwich. So little in fact that half the sandwich fit on a fork.
Chips were stale. Overpriced."
2673,"I don't know who expects a 4 or 5 star experience in an airport, but I feel like they are fooling themselves if they believe they'll find a dining establishment worthy of anything above a 3.5. 

Situated in the Portland Jetport near gates 10 and 11 is Linda Bean's Perfect Maine. With seating that is open to the concourse, yet situated behind a chest high counter with tall stools, you get the feeling of separation from the rest of the airport. 

I have only ever ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, coffee or a manhattan. The salad is good. The lettuce always fresh, the chicken breast juicy, soft, and delicious. It is surprisingly good. The manhattan was well balanced between sweet and dry rye. So good. 

Service is insane. The waitress is super friendly. She has such a nice disposition, and is so accommodating. I expect fast prompt service at an airport. If I have time to kill, then I will eat my food slow, linger with a drink and read. But I expect the staff to be Johnny on the spot. The waitstaff understands this."
2674,"Bored at the airport and what do us Americans do when we're bored? We EAT! Sadly PWM doesn't have many food options. So figured since I'd already tried everything else in the airport today was the lucky day for this spot. Their whole menu is basically about their lobster, which wasn't bad, but beware of the prices. 2 oz of lobster meat was $9 bucks to get it added to my lobster bisque? Of course the menu doesn't say how much it is, half the menu just says market price . Tried the flank steak also with the lobster to make my own surf and turf. The flavoring was basically from the bottle of a1 sauce dumped on top mixed with mushrooms. Next time I'll just stick with Burger King next door"
2675,"Don't get the lobster/crab cake, it was dry and very disappointing. I was so happy I only decided to get one,
as it was bad enough and big, but dry and not worth the $10-11. I think the 4 oz of lobster meat in my lobster bisque was a great heaping portion, but the bisque was runny, flat and plain boring. I had to spike it and infuse it with some additional flavor, Cholula came to the rescue, as it wasn't going down easily without it. I expected so much more for my $37 and for lunch, too."
2676,"The staff was ok, seemingly in moods that ranged from ""I really don't care"" to full panic mode. Seating was a bit slow and that was without a crowd.
Our server cleaned a table for us and gave us a friendly but hurried greeting.
After a few questions and a couple of sips on our beverages our server returned for our food orders. 
Our food came out quickly with a very good presentation. Plating was very attractive.
The Lobster Roll was very tasty with tender and juicy chunks of lobster. The roll was soft but firm enough to not disintegrate.  The lobster tacos had ample lobster meat but a bit too much filler items like peppers and other chopped veggies. Haddock is the fish used in the fried fish entree. It was cooked properly but the breading lacked any real flavor and only had minimal seasoning.
As an airport restaurant I think overall that Linda's is a fair place to fine if you are captive inside the departure concourse. The menu pricing is more expensive than a comparable restaurant off airport but I suppose the rent is more expensive in the airport.
Overall, I think Linda Bean's is a fair option since they prepare ""to go"" orders for the travelers."
2677,"I stopped there last week and in a rush I ordered a beer and a lobster roll. The plane was about to board (which the bartender joked with me about as it was not the first time he heard this 'story') so I luckily received the lobster roll and finished off my beverage. Little did I know that the market price must have been somewhere in the neighborhood of $37! My bill was $44 of which the beer couldn't have been more than $7 so I figure the roll was the driver of the total.

I was there again today and the hostess said the MP for the roll is $24.95 and it had been for a while. Ok...so why happened last week?  The only thing I can think of is the bartender didn't close out the person before me in that seat and I paid for his beers or food as well. Maybe he dislikes travelers so he adds a few extra for Linda Bean?  Well not quite perfect as the name implies.

I was told I can contact HMS who runs the place so that will happen next. I will update my review if there is any follow up..."
2678,"This was one of the worst food experiences I have ever had. I ordered a fried fish sandwich and could have gotten a better one at Burger King next door. Very small piece of fish and so over cooked it was uneatable. 

What bothers me the most is they served it. I waited a long time for that sandwich so my guess is they forgot it in the cooker. The place was not that busy so not sure what would have happened if more than 10 people were eating. Insult to injury was they actually wanted 14.00 for that sandwich (they did comp it after I complained, did not order anything else).

I am from Maine and fly out of the jet port almost every week, not sure I will eat at Bean's any time soon. Maybe they think the tourists won't know any better but you can get a good fish sandwich anywhere I'm Maine and it would beat this.

Time for Ms. Bean to get back involved in the business, this location sets the stage for the rest.

Dissatisfied."
2679,Double kettle soda with lobster quesadilla.  $40.  What a joke! I understand airport prices.  This place is out of control though.  Airport Robbery! It wasn't even that good.  It was ok.
2680,"I had some very mixed feelings about this place. It was very clean and service was great. I wasn't even hungry but had two hours to kill and thought I'd just get a little bit of lobster bisque as a treat during a long layover. So I ordered a bisque with two oz. of lobster. You had a choice of two or four oz. (at an extra charge of course). Then I was asked if I wanted a cup or bowl. To make a long story short, a bowl with just two hours of lobster came to $21. Then added a $3 tip. Yes, I should've asked what the extra lobster cost. My bad. But I'd been enjoying whole lobster dinners all week for that price. Even for airport fare, it seemed excessive for soup. On the positive side, the bisque was delicious!"
2681,"Horrible!!! And it use to be so good here. Lobster tacos highly recommended by server today. They were filled with red peppers, guac and sour cream and a  faint taste of lobster! Husband's burger dry and not cooked to order. Avoid the FOOD here but enjoy a beer. Bill came to$60. for 2 beers and BAD food. Burger King right nxt door. Try that or Shipyard!"
2682,My husband got the full lobster and I got the lobster tail. Both were cooked well and when dipped in butter were good. I am a bit of a lobster snob so I would say it wasn't my favorite. But for the price it was fine.
2683,"Just OK.
Lobster rolls and chowder - core ingredients were OK, but $$$.  Come on... @26.00/plate the crackers and chips should not have been STALE.
Friendly, prompt service."
2684,"To whom it may concern:

This is to inform you of my dining experience yesterday August 12,2017 at 5:45 pm. 

My aunt, who is a travel manager, suggested I have a lobster roll and Rita at your establishment before my flight. 

I sat down and ordered quickly since I had only 30 minutes until my boarding call. I did let the server know of my limited time. 

My chips were burnt tasting, the lobster roll, the bottom was coated in too much mayonnaise. And the Rita bitter. (I left it full on the table) Not good on any of it. I asked what was in a Whoopie Pie, she said look in the glass case.  I asked the server for my bill several times and let her know my disappointment. She seemed annoyed with me. She never brought a paper bill. She finally called over from the computer that the bill was $48!!!! Omg! Really? 

All throughout my Maine visit I had been having lobster rolls. Every place charging $9. Some were much better than the one here and included non burnt French fries. 

I gave her $55 cash and ran out as I was late now for boarding."
2685,"I ordered a lobster roll and not only was it very small, but there was ice inside because it was not defrosted all the way through. My waiter was very professional and handlers the situation well by bringing me a new one, but I cannot recommend this restaurant."
2686,"NO, just say no. This is the worst food I have ever tasted. I ordered the crab grilled cheese, if you would call it crab. I kept saying ""Ew ew eww"" throughout the meal. Chips were soggy and tasteless. The fried fish sandwich was so small that we kept laughing at it. Linda Bean sucks. Burger King would have been much better."
2687,"When you fly in and out of PWM you want to enjoy products from Maine.  I've gone to the bar a few times and see Goose Island and other domestic beers with very few Maine beers.  Maine being a state that brews more beer per capita you would want to see local beers on tap.

Also, the Peta investigation showing Linda Bean's workers mutilating lobster and dismembering them while they were still alive and conscious takes off a few stars.  Anyone knowingly letting this happen should be fined and locked up.

Before you flight head to Sea Dogs Brewing a few miles from the airport or anywhere in town for good Maine products."
2688,"Nice airport food when going through PWM in Portland. I come often for simple and good Maine fare, lobster roles, crab cakes, clam chowder, or like today, lobster bisque!  A bit in the pricey side, but I guess that comes with airport travel.  Right across from gates 9 and 10, so very convenient if you are on American!  All fresh, all good, all Maine!"
2689,"Tourists should eat here before they fly.  Especially if you don't get your lobster fix while you're in Maine. If you live in Maine don't eat here. It won't feel right. 

I couldn't order lobster even though I was in the mood. I hadn't eaten all day and saw lobster tacos on the menu. Yum. All the lobster is listed as ""market price"". So inquiring minds...you know the drill. I asked, ""how much are the tacos today?""...

So I ordered a cheeseburger. Cooked rare. The waitress explained they would not prepare it rare, only medium. I thought those days were gone? Even on the menu, it had that little disclaimer at the bottom of the menu, about eating rare at your own risk.

So I ordered fried calamari. It came at a price on the high end for the appetizer's size. It was tender and tasty with a Thai chili sauce. Like a single layer stretched in a single line across the oval plate it was not a large portion by any standards, but tasty. 

The Bloody Mary was disappointing to a horseradish, olive juice, worcestershire, thick mix lover vs. a Mr & Mrs T's salty thin version. So if you like the latter. Stay.  Or if you're from away enjoy. Locals beware, you'll feel awkward sitting there knowing full well that you're not going to buy lobster there for that price.

Just for you Maine curious about the lobster taco price? It was $25.00."
2690,Didn't expect much considering this little place is at a truck stop but I was honestly surprised. Lobster was awesome although I wish it was on a nicer bun.
2691,"The wait staff and bartender clearly gives 2 Fs less about their guests. So far the cook, who came out in front of house a couple of times, had more responsiveness and value in their engaguement that is expected. Might change it to 1 star if the food comes out bad."
2692,"This place was a rip off.. the service started off terribly. A friend and I stopped for lunch while doing some shopping. I ordered a glass of wine and the waitress ordered me to get out my wallet instead of politely asking me to look at my ID.. it was clear at the start of this experience that our waitress was more interested in taking care of the larger groups around us.
The food was just as terrible as the service. I ordered a cup of clam chowder which was very tiny and flavorless and a flatbread pizza which ended up not having cheese on it... My friend ordered the fish tacos which we're extremely watery which caused her plate to become very wet and her chips quickly became soggy. We were quickly rushed out the door without a thank you or goodbye. We wished we had eaten somewhere with better food or at least kinder service. 
I would never eat here again and would give it 0 stars if I could."
2693,Surprised that airport food could be this good. The calamari is fresh and delicious. Sauce is a nice mix of spicy and sweet. Lobster grilled cheese had giant chunks of lobster. If you're flying through Portland and need a meal at the airport I would stop here.
2694,"Sign said ""please seat yourself."" Went in and sat down. They ignored us for 20 minutes, so we left. Good trip in Maine but it feels a little less friendly after this. You suck Linda Bean."
2695,"We had to eat one more Lobster Roll before departing Maine and Linda Bean's at the airport looked nice and was right across from our gate.  The menu had some great choices.  We each did the traditional roll and substituted the chips for side salads.

The server was polite and quick.  Our cold beers and salads were out in no time.  Husband ordered oil and vinegar and they brought out the pourers of each which is old school and a nice touch.  The Wife's Caesar had homemade (or at least we thought because they were so good) croutons.

Then the rolls!  Perfect portion and they were lined with a fresh Dill mayonnaise and not overly buttered.  We are both not slaw eaters (surprising being from the South) but LB's slaw hit the spot and was a perfect light topping on the Rolls.

You can even purchase a LIVE lobster along with other goodies to take with you on your flight.  If you have time, hang out here before departing Portland."
2696,"I'm not sure why this place is low-ranked, but I had a great airport terminal lunch here.  Perhaps some of the other reviewers are carting along the bad vibes of their self-induced travel stress from Check-In and TSA to the dining area...

While they were a bit short on waitstaff, the two ladies working front of house were flying around quite efficiently, getting my drink, telling me about their lobster roll specials, and getting a food order in within only a couple minutes. 

The lobster roll was actually Great, better than I expected of an airport terminal. The lobster was perfectly cooked, warm and tender, not chewy at all. The seasoning was great and just the right amount of mayo was added so as not to drown the meat in a gross mess. The fresh made chips were great, a good mix of crunchy and just a hint of softness in the middle, properly salted. (They are great with some cocktail sauce for dipping). 

My buddy had a lobster bisque with some add'l lobster chunks and he was similarly pleased. 

Unless here is a drastic swing in food quality and service from shift to shift I don't understand why this place isn't better rated and I'd eat here with confidence."
2697,Worst restaurant I've ever been to.  Lobster tastes like rubber.  Lobster Bisque doesn't have lobster in it.  We left our disgusting food on the table and went hungry.
2698,I wonder if Linda has eaten here lately? Lobster roll bland and light on the lobster. Bun not very good. Cobb salad not as fresh as it could be. What would it take to make this place a great Maine memory on the way home?
2699,"I tried the Lobster roll with chips and a Shipyard Beer.  The only thing good was the service.  The food and drink were pricy and bland.

Lobster was cold, rubbery and flavorless.  The beer was lukewarm.

With tax, my bill was $33.47 ($23.00 for the Lobster Roll and $7.99 for the beer).  I left half the meal and drink sitting."
2700,"I hope this is an anomaly and perhaps they were having issues today, but this place has the worst service EVER. We sat down and waited 25 minutes and eventually walked out. 25 minutes are precious when waiting for a flight! The server made eye contact with us several times and continued to avoid our table. Unprofessional and downright rude. Glad we did not purchase anything bc it wouldn't have been worth the money and she would have made NO TIP"
2701,"Service and food was great. Was a little on the pricy side, when you travel around a little and eat at local establishments you find out actual price of lobster. I checked out Linda's establishment in Freeport last night and similar prices as they are here at the airport. Nearly 4 times what the local places are for lobster. All the same I had the crab roll which was very good perfect size and served with home made chips and slaw. Good quality food. Drinks were high as well but I expected that in an airport."
2702,"Holy bajesus! The colossal lobster roll was $32! It was good, but it wasn't $32 good. Definitely a nice airport option, but pricey."
2703,"I went to this restaurant and was excited to get lobster tacos during a flight delay of several hours.  The server said the tacos were his favorite.  When the tacos were served, I had difficulty finding the lobster - where is it?  In each taco, I found two very small pieces amidst a wide sea of lettuce and cheese.   I had to search to find it.  The lobster meat covered maybe 25% of the length of the taco.  I had to order extra lobster to avoid what was essentially a meatless taco.

The price was not a concern but they are selling meatless tacos here.  Beware!!!"
2704,"A solid airport dining experience. 

The service would be a five star. For a casual airport spot, I couldn't have asked for more. Very friendly and attentive and helpful service.  

A decent selection of wines and beers. I like the Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc which is nice and crisp and served here in 6, 9, and 12 oz pours depending on how bad of a layover you have. 

There are plenty of tasty lobster dishes to choose from, though most are around 25 or so. I opted for the lobster tacos, which were just what I was craving. Lightly toasted tortillas (much appreciated touch), fresh meaty lobster claws, lettuce, tomato, cheese, guac, and sour cream, with some Thousand island type dressing on the side. The cheese adds nothing, and the sour cream is a little too heavy handed, though a little of that or the dressing adds a lot to the taco. This is an awesome way to pass my time before my increasingly delayed flight!"
2705,Considering airport restaurant lobster rolls offered small Medium large. Last lobster roll before departure from Maine. Lobster was fresh and made with both tail and claw meat. Roll was full. Although a bit pricey. Was very good and conveniently served.
2706,"It was nice to run into this place as soon as I got off the plane. There is a lovely skylight so you can sit near the bar area and feel comfy. Got there around 1:30 and it was crazy- my server was at her wits end and mixing up everyone's order. She warned me that it would be a 15-30 min wait for food, no problem for me. 
I ordered the Shipyard Export beer and it was pretty good. I also had the classic lobster roll- delicious! The bread was well-toasted and buttery and the lobster meat was great- seemed fresh and well flavored. They actually had tanks full of lobster mulling about. 
Since this was my first time in Maine I decided to try the Whoopie pie- apparently native to New England. Got one to go in a cute red baggie. 340 calories though so saving it for later on. 
All in all, your standard airport spot with a nice New England twist."
2707,"This place is great for an airport restaurant but only okay as a restaurant in general. 

I got the Maine Lobster Roll and a whoopee pie (don't judge) and found both tasty enough. The Lobster Roll was basically just a hot dog bun with lobster thrown in, but the lobster was too good for me to even remotely care. The handmade potato chips that it came with were equally tasty, if not a bit greasy and salty. The whoopie pie was just okay. 

This place is probably one of your better options in the airport, but I expect not somewhere I would go anywhere else."
2708,"I went to this restaurant on the way out of Portland with my mom. We were expecting a delay at the next airport we were arriving in, and decided it was a smart decision to eat before we left. I of course, had to get a lobster roll before leaving Maine, so I ended up ordering the lobster roll that came with chips. My mom ordered the seafood platter that came with various fried seafood items. It didn't take too long before our food came out and I was certainly surprised with the amount of lobster that was in my roll. Everywhere outside of Maine I have had a lobster roll, has disappointed me and presented me with not enough lobster meat. At Lina Bean's, they gave a real good amount of lobster which made me happy. Their chips were also nice and crispy which i enjoyed. My mom's seafood platter had plenty of food for the both of us and made our stomachs nice and full for the next plane ride."
2709,$27 for lobster Cobb with mushy undercooked lobster.  Yuck.  Really wish I'd gone to Starbucks at the airport instead.
2710,"We had lobsters one last time before our flight back to Manhattan and the experience was a lot better than we had expected based on the other reviews on here. Rebecca, our waitress, was was very kind and attentive. We ordered double for the steamed lobsters for 39.99 which included the lobster bisque. Service and food was excellent! Five stars!"
2711,"Melinda was my server. Very unfriendly. I walked in of course and seated myself as the sign said. She asked if I needed a menu.  I let her know that I did not, I knew what I wanted. She looked as if I should not have. Placed my order and asked for a water no lemon. She was cleaning and sticking her hands in said lemons without washing them first. It was brought without smile or greeting or anything, just slammed on my table. I'm meal was delivered the same way. I asked for condiments and you would have thought I asked for her first born. In the whole state of Maine, during a two week stay, this was the ONLY time I was treated rudely. I gave her one star because I didn't have the option for none."
2712,Went to the food truck at the rest stop in Maine. Literally the worst cup of clam chowder I have ever had in my life. I grew up and live in New England so I have plenty of experience with clam chowder. It was not in any way creamy. It was more of a congealed jelly. Tasted like it had a chicken stock base. Clams were really rubbery. So bad I took it back for a refund. I've never done that before. Just horrible. My husband had lobster bisque which was edible but still not good by any means. Ugh.
2713,"I'm just glad they have somewhat of a seafood restaurant in an airport. The lobster roll is nothing to call home about. Little lobster and no flavor. My bf had the lobster grilled cheese which was surprisingly good! They make their own potato chips which is a plus. Calamari was okay, wasn't a fan of the sweet sauce they drizzled all over it."
2714,"I am not from Maine, but I travel often and eat way too much airport food. I had a great experience here.... good enough to open yelp to leave a review. My fish sandwich was not breaded like the other reviewer. It was on the smallish side, smaller than the bun, but it was really good. Crispy fries. Refills on my soda. What more can you ask?"
2715,"Good food, fresh seafood, plenty of drink options. Plenty of seating, and attentive staff. A great place to park during weather delays."
2716,"One of the better lobster rolls I've had, even by Maine standards. The blueberry pie is also good. If you get it a la mode, it comes with a gigantic scoop of ice cream. But if you're the sort of person who makes consumer choices based on political considerations, you should be aware that Linda Bean was the member of the Bean family whose support for Trump led to the recent consumer boycott of LL Bean products. (I'm not that sort of person, except in extreme cases, and politics are not a factor in my rating.)"
2717,The standards for Linda Beans are definately not the same for the airport restaurant...i had just eaten the day before at their Freeport restaurant and it was awesome. Next day at the airport restaurant blah. The clam chowder definately wasnt the same recipe. I also had the fried fish platter with calamari shrimp and haddock. Not great..
2718,"Had a Linda Bean lobster roll from her lobstah truck at Kennebunk rest area. Awful. Skimpy, overpriced and bland. You're better off going to BK inside."
2719,"I've eaten here a half dozen times. It has always been rather average but today was below average. And certainly no value at $25 for a salad.
Ordered the crab and lobster appetizer and they were again out. Waiter did not know. 
Ordered the Caesar with lobster. Lobster was very fresh but a bit soggy. Lettuce was pathetic. They included the ends of the romaine that should have gone into the trash. The dressing was dumped on in one glob. Not tossed. Croutons were stale. 
The lobster stew is a corn starched thickened tasteless concoction with some lobster meat tossed in. Do not order. 
And don't ask for fresh pepper as they will make you feel ridiculous for asking."
2720,If you are in a hurry as most people are in airport. Don't eat here. Been waiting 35 min and still no food. Don't want to have to scarf down the food.
2721,"This is one of the most delightful airport take out I've had in long time. Chips were freshly fried and crispy, lobster roll was flavorful that made me want to run back out the jetway. 

PWM looks a lot like one of those hipster west coast terminal, but doesn't mean you have to shell out $$$ to dine well. After all this is still Maine.  Life is simple and so the food. As my last meal in Maine I was honestly happy to order my take out at this joint. 
(*keep in mind though, kids grilled cheese was kraft, tasted like crap as Kraft does, that's the only downside and deducted a star for not using locally grown cheese as healthy choice for kids)."
2722,"Yelp deleted my last review because I wasn't specific enough. So, let me get real specific for you. I was taking a flight out of Portland with some time to kill so I got a lobster roll. As soon as I finished I was regretful, I almost missed my flight because I was at the point of beyond diarrhea and close to death. Linda Beans is poison, I'd rather take my chances with sugar free gummy bears."
2723,"I found this place to be a bit overpriced (but that's all airport food, right?), but the lobster roll was delicious. If you're leaving Maine and didn't get a chance to try a roll this is your last chance. You'll enjoy it. The side of chips were over salted but had a nice crunch. 

The service here is speedy because they know you have a flight to catch. It's a nice little spot to wait for a flight of you have the time. There are TVs, subtle music, and comfortable booths."
2724,"Very expensive for poorly done food. I Got the lobster roll in a bit of a hurry so I didn't even open the menu to see the price. After a long wait for regular food but exceptionally long considering how quick a lobster roll should be to prepare, a very forgettable roll was delivered. The meat was flavorless and although the meat should be the star of the show it was mucked up with lots of herb flavoring, dill I think. The potato chips very much tasted like the frying oil needed to be changed.  That cost me $23. Couldn't believe that when I saw the bill. I liked the pickles though!"
2725,"Purchased the $26 Colossal Lobster Roll at Linda Beans Airport Location,and greatly disappointed.  All bread.  Web site states 6 oz of lobster meat, but don't think I got 3-oz.
I know rent is high at the airport, but don't take it out on the customer.  If you choose to open up a restaurant at the airport, be proud of what you serve and sell, so people will talk, tell their airplane seat neighbors, and that is how you increase business and reputation.  I see from other posts that everyone is complaining about the same...
Linda--get with the program !!"
2726,"It tastes like a tramp's taint. The pained expressions of the staff - desperate for a steady paycheck, yet knowing they're peddling pure horse hock at the expense of Maine's once untrammeled beauty - sours the food more than if Mary Magdalene had squatted over it herself."
2727,"I've only had breakfast here, but have been happy every time. I usually order the Downeast breakfast sandwich or the grilled sour dough pannini. Both large enough to share. Coffee is also good and strong. Sit at the bar"
2728,Sit here for 30 minutes after placing order and being served appetizer only to be then be told the lobster cooker is broken...45 more minutes for lobster at least.  Don't make this your last or first chance to get a lobster
2729,Linda beans is a lot better food then shipyard but you also pay a little bit more. Always get lobster something. Very big area. 2 sides of bar seating. Also get your last minute live lobster packaged up for carry on.
2730,"I have had their burger and their fish and chips (actual home made chips, not fries) and they have been good.  

I had the James beard special tasting menu chicken there last week and it was terrible.  Everything tastes frozen and reheated and the chicken had some kind of unidentifiable brown sauce on it.   Even the potatoes tasted freezer burned.   I ended up eating the artichoke dip bit and leaving everything else.   

If your going to eat there stick to their regular menu. The James Beard foundation would be embarrassed by being associated with the dish I got."
2731,"If prices were cheaper I may have given it five stars, but being in the airport they really stick it to you.  Had to get my lobster roll fix and made my coworker who never had one, try it.  It was very sweet with light tartar sauce and big chunks of meat.  Perfectly done."
2732,"Just ordered the lobster tacos at a whooping $26! I have no problem paying for decent food but this didn't pass as decent. The plate arrived looking nice with two large grilled tortillas. There was a bit of lobster peeking out from under the lettuce and red peppers. Unfortunately,the lobster that was peeking out was the only lobster per taco. They actually had more jarred roasted red peppers per taco than lobster. Each taco had a big scoop of sour cream and guacamole-more than necessary. I would love to have weighed the actual lobster on the tacos, could not be more than two ounces total. I should have read reviews prior to eating there, my mistake. I'm a local as well and this is a bad representation of Maine food."
2733,"Usually I love this place. A little expensive, but good. Today, I have been standing here for more than 10 mins trying to order. The staff is running around, completely overwhelmed and disorganized. The kitchen stall are standing around - so I don't think they even have any orders to prepare. I keep being told ""someone will be right with you"", but they would never take my order."
2734,I can't say much for the food but the service was so horrible that we did not get to try the food. We stayed there for thirty minutes and waved down three different servers. Some of them would make eye contact and then just look down or run away. All we wanted was one lobster for the each of the five of us but I guess our money is better spent elsewhere. Such a shame because Maine lobster is so delicious. Hopefully next time the service will be better and I can leave a more accurate review!
2735,"3.5 stars. Dined October 3, 2016. Not perfect, but pretty decent. Airport location was unsurprisingly priced (higher, but it's an airport). Would like to have seen more local-sourced brews, but perhaps later. Lobster roll was meaty, a little more dill & mayo would be nice, a little spice would help, but overall, anice roll. Slaw okay, chips house-made, nice touch. Our server Lindsay did great."
2736,"My boyfriend and I stopped in last night before taking on the holiday shoppers in downtown Freeport. The place wasn't busy at all, and we were seated upstairs. It was a little bit chillier than downstairs due to the complete openess of the space. We were greeted immediately with these massive menus -- I hate having so many options, it takes me forever to decide! 

Our waitress was very pleasant and polite. I ordered a side salad with grilled chicken and he ordered the fried chicken tender dinner.... Mine was awesome. The size was perfect; there were just enough greens in proportion with the grilled chicken breast. His dinner was massive. The great thing about it was also the amount of fries that he shared.. hehe... and came with THREE dipping sauces: ketchup, honey mustard, and a spicey & sweet BBQ sauce. Overall, the dining was a very pleasurable experience and the food satisfying. Our bill was $38, which included our two meals, a beer and glass of wine.

Why didn't I order a lobster roll? Go to a place that's not geared toward tourists and filled with fluff... that's where you'll get your best bang for your buck."
2737,"what a waste of money, do not support this place go support a small business that does it better"
2738,"Correct, fellow Yelpers and native Mainers, this is not ""the world's best lobster roll."" But you know what? Sometimes you have to align your expectations and perspective according to your environs, and in this case, you're in an airport. When you're in an airport, there are always going to be food-related compromises. There are also going to be differing levels or cost or serving size compared to a non-airport eatery.

So, in summary, Linda Bean's is a sunny spot inside the uber-cute Portland airport, where one can grab a quick lobster-related bite to eat, in an area that could not be any more convenient. We also found the service to be exemplary, especially for an airport restaurant, so that was a pleasant surprise.

We didn't find the lobster to be chewy or overcooked as some reviewers as noted, and in fact the bread was fresh, not dry, and there wasn't an overabundance of mayonnaise. There was a little too much claw meat, but maybe that's Linda Bean's style. 

We also enjoyed the salt-and-vinegar kettle chips; they tasted fresh and had a nice tang to them. 

If you didn't have a enough time while in Maine to have an ""on the water"" lobster roll, or you're just passing through the airport, then Linda Bean's is a safe choice. They also will package up a live lobster for you to take on your flight home with you to cook later!"
2739,"The owner has made illegal political contributions to the illegitimate president-elect.  She is unapologetic and says ""I won't stand down.""  If this bothers you, then order your lobster roll at some other restaurant."
2740,"Terrible. The calamari was cold so they took it back, re-fried half of it, and re-served it to me. The Caesar salad was undressed, the broccoli had brown moldy ends, and I never got the cocktail sauce I asked for. 

Truly one of the worst meals I ate during our entire week in Maine."
2741,My husband and I just had to have one last lobster meal before we flew back home and this was a great option! We ordered the lobster roll and the lobster and crab cakes. Both were delicious. The wait staff was friendly and the service was quick!
2742,"I stopped here before boarding a flight to grab one last taste of Maine.  It was okay.  

The wait staff was fabulous, but the food was just ""okay.""  Not bad, but not great, and certainly NOT worth the cost.  

I am going back in a few weeks, and will make sure I eat before I get to the airport and avoid another $35 lunch (4"" lobster roll, cup of chowder, one beer)."
2743,"I'm a born-and-raised Mainer, so I know a good lobster roll. This ain't it. Surprised that another reviewer mentioned that there was too much mayo, because mine didn't seem to have any whatsoever. The lobster didn't seem fresh, and I wasn't too impressed by the quantity of lobster I received in the ""colossal"" size roll I ordered. 

The menu also advertised salt and vinegar kettle chips, but instead I received plain, unsalted, slightly-overcooked kettle chips. The slaw wasn't bad, but that's about all the plate had going for it."
2744,"meh. I had low standards considering its in an airport ...guess they weren't low enough. Lobster omelet was lacking flavor and not worth the $$. No problem, it's just a quick, pricey breakfast. When I ordered I gave the server my credit card so we could expedite the process quickly. He accidentally ran it for another table's check. Ok, mistakes happen at 6am. BUT he never willingly came back, a manager had to fix everything and brought my check. I waited , waved ate everything, then waved some more. After thoroughly alienating the other guests by all the waving I finally got my water. Had gone the entire time without anything to drink. I left a decent tip because anyone who has to work that early in the morning still deserves a tip. Super early mornings suck, as did my experience."
2745,Quick pop in before a flight. Didn't try any seafood by had a solid bacon cheeseburger. Plus they were quick as my flight was boarding.
2746,Great last lobster roll before our weekend trip was over! French fries crispy and coleslaw delicious....my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the dill on the lobster but he squeezed some lemon and enjoyed it ....for airport food this place was great....I was worried the lobster roll was going to be horrible but quite delicious with even a nice toasted butter roll perfectly crisp too
2747,"This restaurant is located inside the airport after the security check out. We wanted one last lobster roll before we leave on our flight out of Maine. I had the lobster quesadillas which were very good and the portion size is enough for two meals at least for me. My husband ordered a lobster roll (6oz) which was about ~$25. After tasting the lobster roll, we decided that we had better elsewhere. The lobster was cold and flavorless, unlike the other lobster rolls we had which had celery and sauce in a buttery toast. I don't think it was worth $25. Service was good. We could sit anywhere we wanted and there weren't that many customers there, so not much to say about that although we waited for our check for a while."
2748,Always delicious food and fast and friendly service. This is my go-to place in Freeport for a cup of chowder.
2749,I came here at 6am before a flight. I had the lobster omelette which was delicious.  I was 1 of 3 people in this restaurant mostly due to the very early morning. I had great service and great food. I would come back again and recommend this place to others. They also have cool lobster tanks and another cool tank with crabs and other sea things to eat.
2750,Great friendly people.  Got the lobster meal for lunch.  It was awesome.  Whole lobster steamed perfectly.  Oh yeah.    The salad and veggie side were well prepared and tasty.    Will definitely come back next time I'm in the Portland airport.
2751,"If I could give it a zero I would.  I was sitting at the counter for 5 minutes to get water. Upon this bitch taking my water order she stated "" you just want water no food"". That's correct I said it.  She filled 4 separate orders before giving me my water. If it wasn't for my need to take my medicine I would have told her to kiss my ass. This is clearly the face of racism,  discrimination and poor customer service. This is the representation of Linda's Beans Maine Lobster wow..Never ever again."
2752,"The food ok but they opened 20 min late and the waitress / bartender was really rude. Good place, but open on time and act like you want to be here."
2753,"Good food, super overpriced.  Nice decor, friendly staff, especially the Jamaican guy that works there."
2754,"Only sit down restaurant in the airport.  On the menu... steamed lobster dinner, lobster grilled cheese, lobster tacos... truly Maine in the summer!"
2755,"We have eaten there twice, at the jetport. Lobster rolls taste like frozen meat: poor texture, weak flavor. Crabmeat rolls are made from some stringy, wiry part of the crab which you rarely if ever see elsewhere in Maine. No leg meat at all. ""Clam Chowder"" was all but certainly canned and very expensive: $9 for a tiny 'bowl'.

I would add that there's celery, and herbs or something, in the lobster roll: a big no-no for me. Quality meat, real mayo, hot dog bun, butter. Really simple to accomplish: everyone screws it up with extras."
2756,Gave up after 10 minutes and still no service. Even went to the counter directly to ask for a menu and the server said hello and walked away. Clearly needs better management.
2757,This has to be the worst meal I've had in a very long time. Ordered the Lobster Roll. It was not edible. It was like chewing a rubber toy. I had to spit it out on my plate or risk choking. Cole slaw was old and dry. Chips/fries were soggy. Wine was good! :).
2758,"The summary is that this is a fast food lobster roll that's not so fast. While it's very nice to have the option to get a lobster roll from Maine at an airport, I was disappointed that the lobster roll served here, within a  couple of miles of the lobster traps, was frozen and overcooked. When cooked properly and fresh, lobster should be tender and not chewy. Two Bay Haven in Cornish is an example of a perfectly cooked lobster. The lobster at this restaurant was chewy and not fresh. The kettle chips served would have been nice (thick and the right amount of salt) if they weren't stale. Being that the restaurant appeared to be fully equipped with a large kitchen, they could have just heated the chips up to freshen them up from the previous day rather than serve chips that had probably been sitting around for a while."
2759,Went here on a cloudy afternoon but great weather to sit outside! We were seated quickly although I had to wait for the bathroom for about 10 minutes (one stall). Kind of annoying for such a big place. We both got the lobster grilled cheese. It sounded way better than it was. Cheese hardly melted and the lobster chunks would just fall out. Other than that the food was okay. Dessert was very good. Our server was very awkward and uncomfortable. Older man that didn't seem to enjoy his job at all :/
2760,"Pretty, pretty bad. I ordered a cheese omelet. They brought me a ham & cheese omelet. Then, breakfast was over so got burger. Wanted salad instead of chips. $3 extra, instead of comping because of original mistake. Needed to ask for a fork. Took forever to get a drink. One bartender wouldn't help the other when asked if I could get a drink. She'll be with you shortly. Food ok. Caesar salad la joke. Don't like vacationers leaving the state with this as their last impression."
2761,"I love the Lobster Roll and chips every time I come here I have to bring my wife one, great service"
2762,"Wow, this has the be the worst lobster roll I've ever had in Maine.  Please please do yourself a favor and seek out a true Maine lobster roll at any of the small wharfs around the state. If you're coming into Maine, run out of the airport and head onto Portland's Commercial Street. You'll find a very genuine lobster roll there. If you're leaving the state, do not eat your last lobster roll in the airport. Savor the one you had out by the ocean and get on your plane. You absolutely will not miss a thing by avoiding Linda Bean's lobster roll."
2763,"Linda Bean should know more about customer service, given her LL Bean DNA. This restaurant is at an airport which means people need to be served efficiently.   If you can't handle breakfast for travelers, don't open in the morning.  I just had the slowest breakfast service ever.  Oatmeal ok but had to wait 30 mins and no coffee refill.  Should have gone to Starbucks.  Better coffee, service and price."
2764,"So hopefully this is not a one hit wonder.

The fish and chips were on point today! Massive fresh slabs of moist haddock fried right with beer batter. Lightly salted. Bright creamy tartar sauce. Crispy lightly dressed slaw and hot fries. 

The barkeep was awesome as always, but the accolades for today's show go to the cooking crew at the back of the house!"
2765,"I don't even think I should be that generous. 

So this is my last meal before flying to my next job and man was I disappointed.  First it's self seating so I chose to sit next to the server at the order kiosk.  He had to see me because I grabbed a menu right beside him. He just stood there playing with his phone for a couple of mins before realizing he had customers.  
And there was no greeting just ""Do you know what you want to order?"" Come in man, at least talk about the weather before asking that question.  Good thing I knew what I wanted. I got a lobster roll with fries. 
First I want to talk about the hot fries or lack of hot fries.  Yea these were stone cold. At least my server was understanding when he took the plate and complained to the cook. And the lobster roll was different.  I don't know if i was suppose to spread the mayo myself or the chef forgot and just put a spoonful on one end. 
Either way I wasn't impressed. The meat wasn't as sweet as I'm use too having.  And after I was finished the server asked if I needed anything else.  Refill of my drink would have been nice midway through my meal but at that point I just wanted to leave. 
Overall one very lowly star.  Service way bad and the price wasn't worth it. Good food ain't cheap and cheap food ain't good motto does not apply here at all. 

Now excuse me, I'm going to the shop to buy a drink. 

M"
2766,"Good place for a beer and a bite before a flight. Inside security at PWM airport.  Some good beer on tap.  Somewhat limited menu, but can always find something.  Watching the end of the game before boarding., Pats are winning big!"
2767,"Shipyard is one of the two options for sit down dining past security at PWM. Since the other is Linda Bean's, but I won't eat there anymore after the whole Trump supporting fiasco. 

Shipyard is spacious and has plenty of comfy tables for relaxing while waiting for your flight. They also have lots of yummy Maine brewed beer on draft for really stellar prices (about $6.99 a beer). I love getting the Maine blueberry beer. It's bright and delicious. They also have beer samplers and Maine made spirits like Cold River Vodka. 
For food here, i've had the caesar and buffalo chicken salads. Both have been very good for airport food. The menu has a ton of options from seafood to burgers, soups and salads. 

Service can be slow but food and drinks come out quickly. Ask to pay the check right when your food comes out if you are in a hurry. They typically have two people for the whole place and one also bartends so they can get overwhelmed. 

This is a great option for any traveler to get a drink or meal."
2768,"Unfortunately this was very disappointing. The hostess made our cocktails and refrained from telling us that they were 4oz drinks rather than the standard 2oz. She did not inform us that they were doubles. She also told us that she was not the bartender but gave no other options for service. When confronted by the manager after we saw our high bill, he was flustered and unprofessional. The place is satisfactory and perhaps the food is good but the service and lack of communication was terrible. Please do better Portland Jetport. This is your only bar!!!"
2769,"As far as airport eateries go, this one isn't terrible.  It still shares a lot of the shortcomings of its brethren.

There was only one server to handle all the tables, which meant service was INCREDIBLY slow.  Fortunately, we had just arrived in Portland and needed to kill time before we could check in to our lodging.

The food is ok.  We really enjoyed the beers.

When you visit, try to sit at the bar, you'll probably get better service."
2770,"The beer was great.  The Chowder was good.
The service was OK, it took several times to get a server and they (I think there were 2) looked hurried and frustrated.  My order came fairly quickly but it took a while to get the bill and I finally walked up with cash and left it at the bar.
It is what it is and I don't expect much more."
2771,Nice people with good service.  The beer was good and so was the lobster in the hotdog bun.... but the lobster was not worth $25! Heck I paid $40 for a 1/2 lobster last night downtown.  Make it 1/2 the price or add twice the lobster and you'll get 5-stars.
2772,"As directed by the ""Seat Yourself"" sign, we did so. And have been sitting at a dirty table for about 20 minutes without any acknowledgement from staff. When another customer sitting nearby attempted to get the attention of the server she responded with ""I'll get to you when I can"" and walked away. Multiple people have been trying to get her attention to pay so they can catch their flight and she is ignoring them and has started to get rude and defensive. 

And after 40 minutes we still haven't been given a menu. 

Extremely poor service with unfriendly staff. Definitely won't be coming back."
2773,"Shipyard has a convenient venue at the Portland International Jetport, which I visited yesterday.  The venue is cozy.  I was pleased with the service by my friendly bartender while awaiting a flight.  They have a decent selection of beers and wines, which are priced a little higher than would be the case if you weren't at the airport.  However, based upon the service I decided to write a short review and give Shipyard a thumbs up in case you are contemplating a visit the next time you are travelling by air out of PWM."
2774,"Can't really go wrong here.  Especially with Linda Beans being one of the only other option for food inside security.  I like the bar here; has a small amount of local craft beers (unlike Linda Beans) and has a better feel.  Prices are not horrible.

Services is usually lack luster.  First time I had a women who wasn't feeling it that night and last night I had a guy who needed some coffee or something.  But then again it's hard to find good service these days; even if you tip it always seems to be an uphill battle to find someone who love their job."
2775,"Worst restaurant experience ever!! The waitress was easily overwhelmed by the amount of people in the restaurant. I ordered a coke and and got an ice tea. Wanted to order food for our party of 4 and was told there was 4 other tables ahead of us. Three people got their food at the same time, the 4 plate came when everyone else was done eating. The waitress didn't make rounds to see if we needed anything else or refilled drinks. The fries were cold and the clam chowder were cold. They are lucky to be in airport because are stuck eating there."
2776,"Initial contact with waitress was impressive-fast and efficient. However, that is where the fun ended. She was having trouble with register so could not easily accomplish a charged meal. The kitchen was so slow people either ate at record speed to make their flight or left without eating. 
The fish and chips was recommended and looked delicious when it arrived. It was crowded into a basket and very hard to eat as the breading on the fish fell off and the fish flaked into mini pieces - I realize that is a sign of well cooked fish, BUT it made it difficult to eat or enjoy. The quantity was more than plenty. 
The beer was cold and delicious, but seemed pricey for local draft. 
All in all, a filling but mediocre meal"
2777,"Worst service ever. 25 minutes of waiting after the server said she'd be right with us. Being at the airport you expect faster service. I watched her serve a couple that walking in 15 minutes later before us. Finally my husband just went to the bar for ""faster"" service. He still waited. Btw... it wasn't busy and no one even apologized for the long wait. Also, Is it possible for a beer to be flat.... ?"
2778,"Food is ok in a pinch. A few steps above McDonald's. And they do have beer. But they can't seem to ever get my orders right even when they're not busy- nachos missing cheese (what?) and today missing item on mediocre burger. And charging .99 for onions on a burger? Oh well, it IS the airport. They DO have outlets available - that's a plus.

Waitstaff is hit or miss. Generally very nice but maybe absent-minded or just not very good. If you are a woman alone at a table you will be ignored. You may not get a ""how is everything?"" until your meal is long gone. although, it never is for me. Big servings of not-so-great fare I can never finish.

The bill arrives super-fast, though. So if you change your mind and want something else, it requires a new check. Oh, also, terrible annoying music that makes it hard to work or read.

They need competition. C'mon Portland, you can do better."
2779,"Family of 5 ordered 5 different menu items... pricey for below average food, kinda have the monopoly here, but if could do over would have preferred to save the $80+..... my advice, stick to the Shipyard beer and steer clear of the food....."
2780,"Pretty slow for an airport restaurant. They offer the burger as medium, but it comes out well done. The stout was a little thin and could have used more malt. French fries were just warm."
2781,"Great food, great service! If you have some time at Portland Jetport stop in, get the Shipyard sampler and have some fresh fish. You won't be disappointed. Yes, they're going to be busy, and yes, you may have to wait. I promise it's worth the wait."
2782,"This location is post security (there are two Shipyard locations at Portland International Jetport - the other location is pre-security).

I had dinner in here before my flight back to Washington Dulles. I should know better - but I ordered one of their salads - and chose the option to add Lobster to the salad. The lobster was so chewy and tough as to be inedible. Which totally downed the whole meal.

Next time I will stick with the traditional bar food: burgers, nachos, and the like, plus their locally brewed craft beers.

If I was rating them solely on their Ales, I'd have given them 4 stars."
2783,"Great service, decent lobster roll.  Very quick and relaxing while waiting for a flight.   Nice decor with plenty of space.

Would be great to offer other local beers such as Allagash, Gritty's, foundation, etc."
2784,"A pretty tiny burger for $13. The meat on it had something off too. Maybe it was grass feed and not labeled as such (I really doubt that someone would be proud to serve grass fed), but it definitely wasn't great meat. And a burger ordered medium was well cooked all the way through, but with how thin the patty was I don't know how it could be any different.

I sat at the bar, the staff talked to each other, around customers, about chronically being over worked and too busy today/this week. 

Shipyard makes good beers though."
2785,Had to send back the clam chowder as it was Brown unappetizing and tasted terrible. The burger was greasy and mediocre to say the best about it and the hummus plate was equally unappetizing.  The hummus itself was decent but tasted like it was store bought. All in all we were very disappointed in a place calling itself shipyard. We have frequented the original location many times and this was a highly disappointing way to send visitors out of state with.
2786,"I had the strawberry Bellini champagne drink and it was pretty good. However, the service is what kills this place for me. My brother and I spent about 40 minutes there and only had two drinks, which we had to wait way too long for. He was just drinking beer on tap so I had a hard time understanding why, especially because we were sitting right next to the bar. It was incredibly expensive for such a disappointing experience. It looked pretty neat when we walked in so I hated that we were disillusioned. Next time I'm in the Portland airport, I will definitely avoid this place."
2787,"Surprisingly friendly and efficient service for an airport pub. We had a couple of beers and split the whoopie pie, which was huge and delicious. Just exercise discretion and order the things you would normally get at an airport bar, and you'll be just fine."
2788,Awesome beer flights and selection. Store has a good selection of miscellaneous merchandise. Would go again in a heartbeat.
2789,"Great staff and convenient for long waits. The food? It's good if you need nourishment. There was too much sauce on chicken bites that lacked chicken. Very crunchy, but very, very little chicken. I opened some pieces and found no chicken at all. I would be willing to try some of the other foods I saw being delivered to other patrons."
2790,"Horrible. I ordered a cup of chowder which was not very tasty, had potatoes that fell apart but was edible. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings. They appeared to be chicken nuggets. I can get over that. It was the sauce that killed it. It looked like brown gravy and was missing any tobacco or vinegar taste. Service was competent."
2791,"Need work in the food area. Clam chowder was either a seafood base or raw flour. Short on clams and potatoes     lLobster roll was cooked meat with a squirt of mayo on top. Expensive for what was received. 

I would stay with something more traditional here - burger wings etc."
2792,"Final resting point of a long day of meetings and pints with a client. Boy oh boy, it was a tough day. Had 2 more drinks, ate some food, was told no to go cups..... Then made my flight by 3 minutes. What a day people in Portland Maine. Love this town, Thank You for the stories Chris B!!!"
2793,"Shipyard Pub & Cafe is one of the more decent places I've dined at any airport (unless it's in Japan because everything in Japan is phenomenal). Mary, my server, was so sweet and pleasant. Everyone in Maine has treated me well and she was no exception. 

I got the Seaside Sandwich which comes with the fresh catch of the day. In my case, it was the haddock and it was pretty tasty. It also comes with a side of fresh vegetables or fries. As an airport meal I was satisfied, but I think it could be a couple dollars cheaper (it was $11)."
2794,"OH! ""OLD THUMPER! 
The yummiest English bitter around.

Stopped here on my way to a flight, fast service and I got ""extra"" money back cause they were out of quarters."
2795,Not bad for airport food. Service was very friendly and attentive. Got our orders to go. I ordered the fish tacos which were delicious. The two tacos had large pieces of fish that were fried perfectly to a golden brown. My husband ordered the pub burger which he said was just okay. It's not a bad choice if you have to pick an airport place to grab a quick bite before flying out.
2796,"For airport food it's not bad. The beer is good and they have plenty of seating both inside and outside the terminal. If someone is picking you up and you are delayed, tell them to park in the garage and have a seat downstairs."
2797,"Service is 5 stars!!! The guys that waited on us were great! Funny, friendly, and no nonsense; they were very accommodating (I'm picky). Food was good. Beer selection was great!"
2798,"Meh. Linda Bean's at the other end of the terminal has Goose Island IPA. Get that instead. Shipyard is not the tastiest beer Maine has to offer. Taps here are the Fuggles IPA, Old Thumper Ale, Export Ale, and seasonal."
2799,"I fly out of the Portland Jetport pretty frequently, and pretty much the only option there is the Shipyard restaurant.  It turns out that's not such a bad thing.

For one, I am a fan of the Shipyard brew pub ales to begin with. If it's available (and it should be) get the Old Thumper ale.  It's a dark amber brew with a clean finish, and not overly hoppy, so it goes down smooth.  On that beer alone, I would give a 5 out of 5.

The menu is not extensive, per se, but it has a good selection of upscale pub-style foods to choose from.  I've yet to find one I dislike, and it's all good comfort food for the weary (or about to be weary) traveler.

The bar area features several televisions, generally showing some sort of sporting event du jour- football, baseball, &c.  

If you're in the Jetport, stop by, grab a beer, watch some TV and enjoy."
2800,"Little pub at PWM Jetport. Nice overpriced airport food. Better than most of these little bars though as the food is cooked fresh and not microwaved. Whenever i'm at PWM I go here and grab a beer and some chicken fingers and it never dissapoints but I can't give it a 5 because there is obviously something lacking, and a 3 seems too harsh for a place that has done just about everything right in this small(ish) airport."
2801,"Service and beer was good to excellent, food was average. Prices weren't too outrageous, around what you would expect from an airport restaurant. I had the fried fish sandwich (don't remember the name) and their beer sampler. Coming from Seattle I enjoy craft/local beers and theirs was decent. The sandwich was served with fries and a pickle spear, wasn't anything to write home about."
2802,"Friendly and accommodating staff, good beer, and decent food. The staff here is fantastic, very quick, friendly and able to make spot on beer and food suggestions. The food: its average, not over priced and good portion size. I personally had the bacon cheddar burger, I wouldn't write home to grandma about it but it filled me up. The Beer: I had a 20 oz Old Thumper, a nice slightly hoppy but very smooth finish amber. The server recommended this when I asked about browns on tap, I was not disappointed. 

PWM has limited options, but this place isn't bad in the landscape of airport dinning. The service is the best I've had in all set down airport restaurants."
2803,"Lots of wait staff but was completely ignored for 10 minutes when I arrived, even though three waitresses looked right at me. It's in the airport so apathetic customer service is a deal killer. Manager didn't care either."
2804,"For the small Portland airport, this is the only real restaurant, and the only place that offers food aside from a couple stands (including Starbucks) and machines offering the typical prepackaged sandwiches, candy and drinks. 
I ordered the Lobster Wrap hoping for a real taste of Maine and i was not disappointed. The wrap consists of a large white flour tortilla, with nothing but large, fresh chunks of lobster and some shredded lettuce. Served with only a lemon wedge and either fries or steamed veggies, this was the perfect meal. I was so happy the wrap was not overcomplicated and actually let you taste the lobster-perfect! 
The rest of their menu consists of a variety of regular pub food, including burgers, fish & chips, sandwiches and the like. 
Try one of the Shipyard beers with your meal to round it off."
2805,"Come for the beer, but realize that this is an airport restaurant before you order the lobster roll. No mixed in mayo, seemingly unfresh lobster, no spices (garlic on bun, Lemon pepper on lobster). It's all edible, but certainly not worth 22 dollars."
2806,"Not the best but not bad for airport fare. Extra points for serving delicious Shipyard beer to soothe my nerves before the flight. In a tiny airport with very limited options, it's nice to have this one."
2807,"For an airport bar, this place was great!  It was cute, conveniently located, very 'Maine' feeling, and had a great menu, great beer list, and was reasonably priced.  The service was a little slow, but the good news is we had some time to kill... as we were working with a delay.  I had the caprese sandwich with french fries and a 20 ounce beer for $20.  Happy camper with a full belly on a short flight."
2808,"This little place was a nice surprise, and within view of my gate so I could watch the constantly changing departure times.  You did not feel isolated from the airport.  I didn't have time to eat, but was happy that there was a nice selection of local beers -- my primary method of judging an airport pub.  It didn't seem pricy for an airport bar, and the staff was very friendly."
2809,"After spending four days in Maine sampling all the foods and beers we are at the airport ready to head home to the ATL. We passed the ""BFI"" on the highway which only a person from this area of Maine would understand. I have decided that the airport is the proof of the pudding if Maine really is the lobster capital of the world. We order a couple of big beers and the lobster roll. We had our first lobster roll at Libby's Market. This one doesn't out shine Libby's, however, it is as true a lobster roll as any AND hands down the best food I have had at any airport in the U.S. The lobster is fresh whole and definitely Maine! We had it with a side of steamed veggies which were hot and steaming fresh. Kristen took very good care of us and our crazy ass Brooklyn friends Michael and Pate. I highly suggest you ask for her. Her sweet demeanor and great attitude made me almost forget I was in an airport getting ready to leave one of the best four day excursions to the north I have had in a long time. If you've never been to Maine it's time to change that.

."
2810,"Pros:  open on Thanksgiving evening for us tourists; no wait, friendly service; plentiful bar and good pour.  Prices reasonable.

Cons:  Food is OK, some items on menu not available (but substitutions were offered). 

Not fine dining but it met our needs."
2811,"Don't come here for modern decor or vibe (it's old and dated).  Don't come here because of a fancy menu (it probably hasn't changed in 30 years).  

Our service was great, food came out fast, and most of all it's a good value.  $22 for a giant lobster dinner with delicious french fries.  

Kid friendly.  Also they have a pretty awesome salt water fish tank, which the kids did love."
2812,"Worst family dinner experience of my life. Absolutely none of our orders were up to eating standards. Everything was either cold (Alfredo noodles), crunchy (under cooked rice), burnt (chicken), or over cooked steaks. This was unacceptable and the waiters sad excuse of ""I'm not the chef"" -Greg B, is not going to fly. The place was basically empty tonight and not one of our 10 orders was up to basic eating standards. When it was time for the bill the waiter, Greg B. had to run back and forth to the computer 4 times to get the checks right!!!!!!!! If he is new I think he should require some more training. The ONLY person who knew what they were doing tonight and was the bartender. 
To top it all off, we asked to see a manager and Greg B. told us that there were no managers on duty tonight, I don't know about you but I am calling B.S. 
I would never come back here again after the shit storm this family was put through. I'm only putting one star but I'm REQUIRED TOO."
2813,"This is one of the oldest establishments in the Portland Old Port area. Down a small flight of stairs into the basement of the building where you descend another small flight of stairs to the dining and bar area. We are here for a drink so we go to the bar and take seat. The bartender is busy tending to tables of people who are there for a bite to eat on this Easter Sunday. We are greeting by bartender and then told it would be a moment. Then another staff member acknowledged us and then another member! Great customer service yet no service yet. It wasn't long before we had our drinks and were enjoying the calming fish tank behind the bar. Four televisions were on with baseball and tennis games. There was a regular menu to goose from as well as some specials. We had already eaten but made the observation just the same. 
Drinks were per usual nothing to write home about and the staff was friendly and personable."
2814,"Service good but food very bland. Disappointed as we are here years ago and after tonight's meal, wonder how they have stayed in business so long. Hope food can be brought back to quality we enjoyed several years ago."
2815,"- good prices.
- fun staff.
- dancing here is fun, the dance floor is huge!
- the music is so fun and hip.
- it's always clean and nice in there.
- very fun, club kind of atmosphere.
- lots of seating and room to dance or just stand around!"
2816,"Ehh. I took my family here when we were visiting Portland. I can't imagine I'll go back. 

Service: The service was fine. Nothing to complain about, but I wasn't impressed in any way.

Food: The clam chowder was pretty good. My halibut had absolutely no flavor. The side options are not very enticing. 

Price: My family of 4 got out of there for $80 (pre-tip). We ordered 2 bowls of chowder, 2 kids meals, and 2 adult entrees. It was about what I expected. 

Environment: The bathrooms were pretty rough. I can't imagine the decor has changed in 30 years. There were some fish tanks that excited the kids. And a 3-foot long naked mermaid on the wall."
2817,"We walked in to the bar, never having been here, to grab a drink and maybe some food. As soon as we walked in a bartender greeted us with eye contact, said hello and asked if we would like a menu. We said yes and continued to walk to two seats at the end of the bar. She never gave us the menus and we never saw her again.

The only reason we ended up with a drink is because I made eye contact with a gentleman working behind the bar and told him what I wanted (without him asking). Once again, no menu.

Luckily we made friends with two couple who were also sitting at the bar and we chatted with them a bit. They left and we followed suit shortly after. Still no menu. 

We would have eaten here had we known what they had to offer. Poor service. Won't be stopping here again."
2818,"While the atmosphere is charming, the service and food are just mediocre.  Nothing really stood out from this experience."
2819,"We ran in when it began raining, and the experience left us wishing we were back out stuck in the rain. The wait staff is very friendly and kind, but the service outside of their control is awful. The glasses are filthy - mainly because they moonlight as children's crayon storage when not in use by liquids. We had to ask for bottles of water because the glasses were so filthy. 

The kitchen runs all orders sequentially, meaning appetizers are fired with your full meal. 45 minutes waiting for our appetizer. 

I got a burger with cheese, the most interesting thing on the menu. It was fine, no complaints with the taste. The woman at the table next to me repeatedly asked the wait staff how fresh the halibut was, letting her know she'd send it back if it arrived too fishy. I tragically left before their food came, I was hoping to see if the halibut came pre-frozen like those 45 minute mozzarella sticks.  

It really is a shame - the wait staff are nice, but it's very clear not an iota of care, passion, or love goes into the work there. The owner seems fine with mediocre service. If it weren't raining, I have a feeling it'd be a ghost town in there. The place has a lot of potential - but 0/10 would never go back, even if it were monsoon-ing outside."
2820,"I was visiting a friend this past weekend and came here for drinks. DJ was playing great music (90's hip hop). At about 12:55am, a new song came on, about 10 seconds later, the lights turned on and the music abruptly stopped. Very interesting way to end a dance floor. No announcement of last call or anything.

I went to the bar to close out the tab. There was a gentleman there closing out his tab. He asked for his tab (has a full beer in hand) and the bartender with long, blonde hair rushes to grab his beer. He tells her that it's full and she says that she has to take it. This got him pissed off because he paid for it so she slams his money on the counter and tells him he doesn't want her money (for a tip). I'm sorry, but that is HORRIBLE customer service. This guy was not intoxicated by any means, because I chatted with him. I'm sure she deals with drunk, obliterated guys all the time, but you are a bartender at 1am. She gets mad at me for giving her a look because she was extremely rude. I tell her there is no need to be act the way she is, especially in the service industry. She continues to go to another bartender and tell her everything!

We go outside to leave, and we see the bartender come out and have a cigarette, again, just STARING.

You have go to get bartenders who are not jerks to their customers. These are the customers that allow them to have jobs. Without us, who do you serve? Thankfully, I don't live in Maine so I will never see this chick again, but even so, hopefully people read this and STAY AWAY from this bar/bartender. She is ridiculous."
2821,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon, we were seated right away and there were lots of empty tables. I had the pasta with shrimp which was just okay with flavor flavor. My friend had the lobster roll and enjoyed it. The onion rings were crisp and good. 
At night there's nightlife apparently, I wasn't able to come back.
Overall, it's an okay place to eat or grab a drink. The service was slow and I hurt my finger in the bathroom :(. The first stall has a faulty lock, becareful!"
2822,"DO NOT GO HERE. BUYER BEWARE 

Terrible service, horrible food and an atmosphere that's nothing to write home about. Waiting is part of eating out but it shouldn't take over an hour to get 2 burgers to the table. 

Worst service I've ever experienced. Bartenders were very racist to my friend and only being two drinks in thought it was enough reason to kick him out. 

Cant believe this place is still up and running. Huge disgrace to any place that claims to be a seafood hub. 

DO NOT GO HERE. BUYER BEWARE."
2823,"This review is based solely on their late night experience. If you are looking for a decent place to dance and get drinks in the evening, Old Port Tavern is a perfect place if you want to shy away from the bars that are crowded. Old Port Tavern always has a DJ and there is plenty of seating if you don't want to partake in dancing. They have a decent selection of draft beers and mixed drinks, and the crowd of people is always friendly."
2824,"OPT is a great place for some late night drinks and dancing.  Their drink prices are reasonable and the music is pretty good too. It also pulls in a fun crowd of various people!
This is typically always a pit stop for some Friday night fun!"
2825,"This was our first Maine lobster. I don't think we could have chosen a better place to have our lobster. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the bisque was ambrosial, and they had great fries. 
The atmosphere was fantastic with their art and huge salt water tanks. The service was a bit slow only because there was not enough wait staff. But Jessica our waitress was blissful and charming. 
I completely recommend stopping in for a meal or the live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays."
2826,"After ordering and paying for a few drinks bartender with overly tight tee shirt and beer gut tells me "".50 cent is only gonna get you watered down drinks"". 
I leaned in and asked him to repeat himself, again he says "".50 cent tip is only gonna get you watered down drinks"" followed by  ""you left me a .50 cent tip on your last drink"". 
I politely told him he had me mistaken, then he proceeds to pull out my last slip. Holds it up and says ""oh, I must have misread it, you did the math wrong"". 
I don't mind this establishment, but moving forward, I hope to receive better service. Until then I will leave .50 cent tips. Call me fitty..."
2827,Standing up for my friend who clashed with bouncers and bartenders here. Kicked him out for disruption but when pressed for an example they couldn't provide it since he hadn't interacted with any other bouncers that were claiming he was being a disruption. He's of Indian descent. When he claimed they were targeting him racially they couldn't defend themselves. Trashy+racist establishment. Making sure to steer clear of here whenever I'm in Maine!!
2828,"Amazing lobster bisque! Best I've ever had! Be prepared to pay $17 for a bowl but the chunks of lobster in the soup make it worth it. If you're in Portland, Maine, you must drop into this cute restaurant, eat their bread and drink their soup. I'm sure they have other delicious items on the menu but I was only their for the bisque as I was told that I needed to go there specifically for that. Enjoy! And thank you Old Port Tavern!"
2829,"My wife and I came here on a rainy Memorial Day and were in somewhat of a bad mood, so it would have taken a lot to make us enjoy our visit. Happily, I thought that they rose to the occasion. The setting was dark and mysterious, with lots of blue neon lights and several aquariums around the restaurant and behind the bar. If there was ever an underwater lair straight out of a James Bond movie, this place could be it!

I had the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich and a side of fries. The meat was cooked to well done (I like my prime rib a bit on the rarer side) but with the au jus I thought it tasted great. The fries were super crispy. My wife had the homemade fish sticks and fries and they looked really good though she never offered one to me (they must have been that good!) All in all, the food was fine but the atmosphere was pretty cool. It wasn't busy despite being a rainy day during a long weekend, and I was happy with our service."
2830,"Advertised that they close at 9:30 walked in at 8:30 for a table of 3 and were told they just had a lot of people come in and they were not seating anymore for dinner. WHAT? In Portland in the height of the season on a Saturday evening and you are not seating any more an hour before you close? We are pretty loyal tourists and when treated right, WE KEEP COMING BACK. Money better spent elsewhere."
2831,"We have visited this restaurant twice now. Top notch food, and service. Something for everyone on the menu with prices that are more than fair."
2832,"They make a very stiff drink but outside of that stay away. Their decor is something straight out of the 60, service was slow and the waitress was doing us a favor waiting on us. Got the crab dip, tasted straight out of the freezer. Touched the fancy mermaid and was covered in dust. Did not have dinner so can't comment on the other food"
2833,"After what we went through last night we will never go back. Service was great(poor young lady), ordered apps and drinks my wife's chowder was cold. We all ordered(8 of us) after about 35 min of waiting for our food, the waitress comes over and says to my father in law that they are out of the lobster special. She offered him something for free but IMO that's doesn't cut it. I told her I over heard the cook tell the other server that they 86'd the lobster and prime rib what they failed to do was tell her! So Mr. Manager comes over and could care less, I just said give us the bill for what we had and we're leaving, he says just go so we did. As I'm walking out I hear the other server and manager blaming our waitress who was great, I told them it was there fault and not hers and I tipped accordingly. What a shame this place has turned out to be. You couldn't pay me to go there again!!!!"
2834,"This is a great example of being hungry and stopping at the first place along the way. We were craving seafood and stopped here for lunch on Saturday. I will say the fish tanks are amazing and cool to see them around the restaurant. The menu is just okay. I ordered the haddock chowder and it was way overpriced and super bland. I had to add a ton of pepper to it to get it tasty and there wasn't much haddock in it. My dining partner ordered the lobster pie and it was just so so. Not too much lobster and swimming in an oddly sweet sauce. It came with a side salad that was okay. My main issue with this place is cleanliness. The bathroom was a wreck. Two of the three stalls didn't have toilet paper. The doors were hard to open and close and then to lock them was a struggle. The floors were disgusting. I don't know where the water came from but it was almost muddy. Yuck. Finally, my friend was served a beer in a glass that had lipstick stains all over it. He doesn't wear lipstick so obviously it came like that and makes me really wonder how they wash dishes. It was taken off the bill but if we had seen that on the first drink and then seen the bathroom, I would have left and not eaten there. Topping it off, the pen they gave us at the end didn't work and fell apart. They were busy so they do get lots of customers but I don't see us returning."
2835,"Great lil tavern in Portland. Had some delish chowda (clam and lobstah bisque) along w/fried shrimp, teriyaki steak and salads. Great food and service."
2836,"Good selection of local craft beers. Only came here for drinks as we were drinking our way through Old Port. The staff was kinda standoffish. They had 3 bartenders behind the bar, but it only looked like one was doing everything. Had a local acoustic singer playing that was great. We will give this place another go."
2837,"Easily the worst tavern in Portland. We came after a two hour car ride starving and they took 15 minutes to seat us. Ordered drinks, another 20 minutes. Finally ordered food, took an hour and a half for just the appetizers to come over. They only had a few other tables seated too and it took ridiculously long. Two waiters and they were the hosts, bartenders, servers, etc. Absolutely awful, would never return. Only until we went into the kitchen to ask where our food was did they come running out with our lukewarm order. What a bad first introduction to Portland."
2838,"I had gotten the Prime Rib special, it was big, and pretty darn good. My girlfriend got the fish sticks appetizer, that was also good. 

Solid food, decently priced. Recommended for a pub."
2839,"Don't go here if you want pleasant service!
First they had to clear a table, but the table the led us to 10 minutes later was the same open table we saw when we walked in.
Then I had to ask the front girl to get a waiter as they continued to walk by for 15 more minutes.
Then my wife asked for no onions - instead they served her meal at the same time as the appetizer AND smothered it with onions.
Then they brought it out back and instead of making a new one, they just scraped what they could off.....
They served the other 3 at my table, brought me a beer but no glass.
After a few more minutes, and the rest of the table almost done their meal, I waved down the bar tender to have them ask about my order.
Ooops, they forgot about my order.
Wait another 15 minutes and my order came out.,,,,everyone else was finished.
And instead of onion rings they gave me French fries!! OMG can anything else go wrong?
They comped my appetizer- well that was nice.
I'll never go there again."
2840,Great atmosphere! Horrible service and the lobster stuffed haddock had literally two minuscule pieces of lobster which I did not eat just to show the server . The bartenders were more interested in chatting than serving customers. I worked in the restaurant industry as a regional manager for Outback Steakhouse for many years and know good customer service and quality food. The only reason this place is in business still is because of their location. We met other folks from out of town as well who had the same opinion about all of the above. Don't waste your time or money at this place.
2841,"What can I say about this place.  My son has a number of severe food
Allergies making eating out a challenge. That is until we came here.  Never in 10 years of taking my son to restaurants have I seen a waitress or chef more attentive to making sure he had safe choices.  The chef knew every minute ingredient to every dish and when we ran into a dish or two that contained ingredients he was allergic to the chef made good safe alternative suggestions.  

Both took us seriously and both makes sure that not only was he safe but he had a number of delicious choices.  For that I will forever be grateful and I will dine here everything
I'm in Portland!"
2842,TERRIBLE. I Called days in advance for a birthday party of 12. We arrived at the reserved time to the RUDE host saying we had no reservation. They did NOTHING to remedy the situation and simply told us we had to wait. I showed them my caller ID to prove I had call to no resolve. I told them the manager had approved the reservation and still nothing. They were rude and simply REFUSED to help the situation. Will NOT RETURN. TRASH SERVICE
2843,"Came here on Christmas Eve day. They were open, which was great, but only one bartender/server. He was really stressed out and snapped at us. I get it, but don't take it out on the customers. Call the owner and tell them you have to close. Went around the corner to a lovely little cafe with friendly people."
2844,"Service was extremely slow and the menu stated most entrees were served with the ""the vegetable du jour"", but the vegetable was missing from all of our entrees.  Steak was dry, stuffed sole was lacking in flavor."
2845,"Horrible service, horrible food... prime rib was like shoe leather and no taste.. so disappointed"
2846,"I went to check on how long it was till my turn for karaoke, the dj swore and yelled in my face. I tried to calm him down and gestured with my hand pointing to my name, but when I pointed my finger at his paper he gestured to a bouncer and yelled that I had crossed the booth line. It was so bizarre and I was so confused to what I did to make him so angry. I had been nursing my first drink of the night for a little over an hour so I can say for certain I wasn't being drunk and disorderly. The bouncer was sympathetic and apologized, explained that he(dj) was having a bad night."
2847,"The atmosphere was very fun and the waitress was friendly, but our orders were messed up and served cold. We were a party of four and two of our orders came out wrong TWICE! And this was even after the waitress had to come back to re ask us what we ordered. Maybe we caught them on an off day, but the experience wasn't great."
2848,"We ate on a Saturday night during Memorial Day Weekend before going to a show at a local venue in the Old Port. They were busy, it's early in the season, and I think our server was new. All of these facts may have contributed to a not so great meal. 

What follows isn't a glowing review, but I must say, the fish and chips were terrific!

When we arrived, there was a larger party waiting to be seated. Once they were, we waited at the host stand for a few minutes while staff went about their tasks. Welcoming, or acknowledging us, was not one of those tasks. The bartender (manager) came over and explained that they had just seated two large parties and, if we wanted to be shown to our table we could get drinks, but it might be a bit before we ordered food. This was fine with us. Except they could only give us one menu, because the others were in use. 

We sat, and just as our server was bringing us water, it seemed like the water glasses weren't very clean. Some were old and cloudy from the dishwasher, but some had residue in them. We asked, and got, new glasses. 

Our first round of drinks came and, after a wait, we ordered food. The wait wasn't a problem because they had cola ones the situation. 

My spouse ordered fish chowder and a salad with steak (though there were two sizes, the server never asked for clarification). One friend ordered fish and chips and a Ceasar salad to start, and the other friend ordered the fried shrimp dinner. 

My spouses salad with steak tips came out first. It was the small size (not what she expected) with very good steak piled in top. No other food came out, but we insisted she eat. We could see a salad waiting in the kitchen window, and guessed it was for our friend, but the server didn't deliver it until we inquired, about 10 minutes later. She also brought my spouse's chowder at this point. After another 5 to 10 minutes, our orders of fish and chips and fried shrimp came. 

The food was decent, the server was very sweet, but very new to the job. We also figured out that there are two menus - one for the dining room (where we sat), which is a lot of tourist-geared seafood, and another menu for the bar which had some other options members of our party might have enjoyed. 

So, if you go in the summer, be patient, be clear about what you want and when you want it, and ask to see both menus. And make sure the glasses are clean."
2849,"Honestly terrible experience. We came in around 8:30 on a weeknight and were clearly not welcome from the start, even though there were only 3 other people in the entire place and were told it was open until 1AM. Pressured to order quickly and felt decidedly unwelcome and like we were infringing on something. Bartender left bar several times and made it clear she didn't want us there. I understand holding down a bar on a weeknight can be difficult, but this was just ridiculous. We were just trying to spend some time in the Old Port! Not coming back."
2850,"Went to Old Port Tavern this evening just before 6. Bar area was full but where my wife and I were seated was seated was empty but 1 table. I wasn't hungry but my wife ordered a burger. After 20 minutes our side of the restaurant not only had customers but they had food. At 30  minutes our sever had done nothing but place a bottle of ketsup on our table while walking by. Never even asked about drinks. 
We decided to cut our losses and walk out as every other party was eating. We left without saying a word. When we were about fifty feet from the establishment our server came up from behind us and was yelling that we should have told her we were leaving. I told her that we didn't blame her for the delay. She insisted that we should have said something to her to indicate that we were unsatisfied. My wife said well the only time we saw you after we ordered was when you stopped to drop off ketchup and never inquired if we needed anything. She said well you shouldn't have walked out and began walking away. I followed her and said you're right I'm going to complain to the manager. She said I'm the manager and you said it wasn't my fault. I replied that's when I thought you were just my server. As the manager you should be ashamed of yourself for following us out and confronting us when your service was so bad. She replied... Have you ever worked in the field to which I said yes and you should be embarrassed. I said what's you're name. She said Amanda and walked away. Diner beware!"
2851,"Avoid, avoid, avoid.  I cannot conceive how this place has 3 stars.  I recently moved to Maine and the novelty of a lobster roll on my lunch hour has yet to wane.  After wandering around the old port and trying many different establishments, I stumbled upon the Old Port Tavern.  

I asked the server - before ordering - if the lobster roll was a mix of meat.  She assured me it was. She went so far as to say it is ""whole chunks"" and ""nothing yucky.""  That should've been a red flag instantly, but I continued to ask if the meat was fresh, frozen, etc...  Once again, I was assured it was a ""combination of claw, knuckle and tail and it is picked fresh every day.""  Ok - so I ordered the lobster roll, I was sold.  

My lobster roll arrived in a gigantic bun.  Not much meat - huge bun.  As I started picking through the meat, I noticed that it was ALL CLAW meat. And it was spongey.  And it was definitely NOT fresh.  So, I mentioned to the server that the lobster roll contained no tail.  She seemed confused, then explained that the reason my lobster roll contained all claw was because I ordered my lobster roll with no mayo - everything else had been prepped already with mayo.  She went to confer with the chef (cook?) and came back to the table with a small plastic container of knuckle meat.  Ooooohkay? This meat was halfway frozen in the middle.  Seriously.  

Not sure how frozen knuckle meat is supposed to compensate for the missing lobster tail, but at that point I knew it was a losing battle.  I paid the check and headed back to work....hungry....craving a decent lobster roll.

Would I go back?  Nope.  Would I suggest you ignore my review and give it a try - hoping that your experience will be different?  Nope.  I could've gotten a better lobster roll at a McDonald's in Connecticut!"
2852,"Had the fried shrimp plate, which was average.  The inside was decently decorated and the staff was pleasant."
2853,"As a tourist, I did not feel welcomed here. It had a very local feel that someone who wasn't there at least once a week should not even bother to come in. The food was extremely mediocre, service was slow and not very friendly. Not worth the cost in my opinion. They do have a great statue, but there are better things in Portland for a much better price."
2854,Fish tanks were cool. Kind of dead. Waiting on my mile high peanut butter pie. I'll look at the pretty fish while I wait.
2855,"Was our first night here. Decided to get Steak and Lobster. Lobster was extremely overdone it was hard to bite into and the steak even as a med-rare was so tough and flavorless. It seamed like they just put it on a grill no salt no anything. 

This place is great for drinks and watching a game."
2856,"Cleanliness 4

Food 3
Likelihood 3
OVERALL 3

I found this location on Google Maps.  The menu seemed promising.  We were greeted promptly when we arrived by the bartender/host.  We were seated in the restaurant.  A gentleman came by to see what our drink order was.  He said our server would be with us soon.  It took a bit of time for her to make it to us, I believe she was the ONLY server on the floor.

She took our order.  I ordered a salad that was not served ahead of the meal, that was a bit disappointing. The food was hot, and fresh.  The crab cakes were sent back as they were too salty.  We found a long black hair in the bottom of the soup bowl we shared (no one at our table has long black hair.)  We didn't share that.  The kitchen is in view of the tables, and one of the chefs, DID have long black hair.

Service was good, for one server.  Food was ok.  Overall, not a place I would put on my must-return-to card.  I would try it again in the future to see if this just was a bad night."
2857,"Interesting how reviews vary in ratings-- I've certainly provided poor feedback to ""highly rated"" restaurants in the past. When I went to this restaurant in Portland ME, I experienced great food, and great service. I can't talk much to the drinks (didn't have any), but I can speak for the food. The home seafood chowder was exceptional and had a lot of meat. I've never quite had one like this before. The lobster dinner was amazing and fantastic. To people who have never eaten lobsters, they give a a sheet telling you how to open it and eat it-- this contributed to the way I enjoyed the lobster dinner. My friends had the vegetarian alfredo pasta, which had a generous serving for a good price. I'd definitely recommend this place and will visit again if I visit Portland ME."
2858,"It's been a month since I tried Old Port Tavern Steakhouse, and I'm still irritated about the way we were treated.  We went for lunch and lobster, steak, soup, fries, etc.  The waitress look a while to get to us because she was busy chatting up the other customers that were there for drinks only (probably it was easier to earn tips off of drinks than food) than serving us.  She did not serve us the salad, soup, or fries in advance.  All the food came out at the same time and all cold.  The waitress did not bring us ketchup for fries or check if we have the plates, utensils, or condiments.  We got this all ourselves from the kitchen.  She did not bother to even check up on us.  The only thing she did do was to give herself a 20% tip.  When we ask why tip was automatically added to the bill and if we can adjust it (that was DEFINITELY not worthy of a 20% tip), she and the manager said that this mandatory tip was advertised on the menu.  I'm adding a copy of the lunch menu to show that this was NOT listed on the menu so if you don't mind overpaying for your food, being lied to, and treated like crap but having to tip 20%, by all means, go to this place."
2859,"After being unable to get into another local pub/restaurant we stumbled upon this place and were glad we did.

Huge salt water aquariums inside were amazingly clean and filled with colourful fish.  Simple decor with brick interior walls make this place comfortable and inviting. 

I'm not a huge seafood fan but had the house special haddock which was grilled to perfection with a crispy sweet rub.  Salad was uber fresh and crab dip and  chips were awesome. 

Unfortunately our appetizer came with the meal but the freshness and great flavours made up for this minor error.

A great local seafood experience."
2860,Went to old port tavern and found a cockroach in my food. Absolutely disgusted. Will never go there again.
2861,"I'm going to preface this review by saying we stopped in only to get out of the rain and use the restroom. We never intended on eating, running up a bar tab, watching sports or hanging out. We came in, sat at the bar and talked to the bartender who was very friendly. She gave us the happy hour price for beer even though it was about 20 minutes until it actually started. She talked to us about upcoming activities in the city that may be worth checking out and was good company for the one beer we had as we waited for the rain to pass by. It was really clutch to find this place and be treated so well even though she knew we would only be there for a few minutes."
2862,"There's no windows, and the large fish tanks cast a watery light into the dimly-lit dining areas. There's one tank behind the bar (good eye candy for bar sitters), and an 800 gallon tank in the back dining area. 

I can imagine this being a good place for revelry when the sun goes down. As for me, I was there for lunch, and I was the only patron in the place. The openness of the space emphasized the lack of clientele, which made dining solo a bit awkward instead of the fun, somewhat quirky experience I had hoped for. Alas.

I asked for the server's recommendation, and she pointed me towards the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich on a toasted baguette with Swiss cheese and au jus dip. It sounds fancy, but it was really just a steak and cheese with a watery sauce on the side. The fries were solid pub fries.

After refusing desert and saying I was all set, it took forever to get my check. I eventually waved the otherwise-attentive server down to ask for it. This was confusing. I was her only customer, and I was so obviously done with my meal, I don't know why she didn't bring the check.

I have a feeling I didn't get the best of the Old Port Tavern Steakhouse. I'd like to go back when it's more lively, but as it was, it was overall a very ""meh"" experience."
2863,"A little mainstream for our tastes, with kaleidoscopic television screens broadcasting a basketball game, this atmospheric, brick building was saved from a disastrous review by the live music on offer, which had tempted us in from the streets as if we were the rats of Hamelin. This music, coupled with a long, hypnotic fish tank behind the bar, bumped the place up a star as we ended up having a good time!"
2864,"If I could rate negative stars I would. Here in Portland for a little vacation and my boyfriend and I stop in to have a quick bite before walking around, all we ordered was chowders and needless to say they could have killed us. As I took a bite of my chowder I felt something sharp in my mouth and when I took it out there were tiny shards of what seemed to be metal in my mouth. This is clam chowder, there should be no shards of anything (bones etc). That is despicable. Avoid the clam chowder here if you can. 

(One note, our waitress did take the soups off our bill which was very much appreciated) 

Yikes."
2865,The retirement home food version of Portland Maine. Was kind of surprised that purée wasn't an option. Lame karaoke scene as well. DJ was kind of douchey. Bartender was ok.
2866,"OPT is my spirit animal. OPT is my happy place. OPT is the place where every good night ends.

They have karaoke Sunday- Thursday and it's not at all pretentious. Like I can do 3 songs in one night and it's totally acceptable. 

For all you haters out there: duh, this is not a place you come for a ""nice dinner""- this is a place you come to get crazy, to drink red bull vodkas and to dance your whole face off at the end of a typical Old Port drinkfest. I LOVE OPT."
2867,"Where to begin...

I arrived into what my friend and I thought would be a great atmosphere.  It was sensory overload with the fish tanks, which was pretty awesome!  We were sat down in the dining room and we waited for our waiter...and waited....and waited...  He showed up, with absolutely no personality.  A rock in the ocean has more of a personality than this guy.  

Ordered drinks, he also poured us water.  Drinks came about 5 minutes later.  He asked if we were ready to order, we weren't quite ready yet.  He returned 10-12 minutes later and asked if we were ready.  We ordered.

15 minutes later our food was up on the shelf between the kitchen and the dining room (clearly visible)  It sat there for at least 10 minutes.  Then the waiter grabbed it, brought it over and we both had emptied drinks.  He didn't ask if we wanted a refill and he walked away.  

The burger I ordered tasted cool and also tasted like it was expired meat.  He was no where to be found to complain about it.  I was hungry, so I slowly ate it but didn't finish.  He eventually showed up again, about 10 minutes after he delivered the food and asked if I wanted a refill, I said yes to having more water.  Both of our glasses were empty, he only fills up mine and not my friend's.  Walks away.

The food was mediocre, at best.  The service sucked.  I know that I will never go back to this establishment and it doesn't look like I am the only one complaining about the service.

Hire people who want to work and want to engage their customers.  There are PLENTY of other establishments looking for business and will strive to make their customer's experience one to remember in a positive manner!

As for the food, I believe a complaint to the Board of Health should be in order.  The food was foul...this is also not the first complaint..."
2868,"This review is based on drinks and casual nightlife - loved this place!  Very casual and comfortable.  Very friendly service.  We went for drinks two nights while visiting Portland.  I have no idea how good the food is, but in terms of sitting at the bar, listening to music, and relaxing, this place is great."
2869,I've never gone there for the food.  I go for karaoke.  They have it Sunday-Thursday.  Beautiful fishtanks.  Great drinks.
2870,"Tried this place yesterday - host seemed quite bothered to seat us. Asked if he was the owner and after a second time he grunted said his wife owns the place.
  Sat in bar area - waitress very nice - restrooms filthy and stunk so we left immediately."
2871,"We went here for dinner on a Friday night. Half of the menu was crossed out because they were out of the items. The salmon from the daily menu tasted good, but it was dry. The clam chowder was awful. We have better clam chowder in Wisconsin. I would not go here for dinner again, BUT the beer was good. Go there to drink. They have two large bars."
2872,Great place the lobster bisque was very good and have a lot lobster than I expect and the steak was pretty good. So sad that there were out of lobster when we there
2873,"A solid enough place to get a beer, but it's kind of dungeon-y and it smelled an awful lot like pee. 

The burger was fair, nothing to write home about. 

Also the men's room looks like a prison. For real. I think they were going for ""industrial goth"" but ended up with ""Leavenworth Rape Toilet""."
2874,Tasty!! We went in just before the kitchen closed and everything was yummy! The fish and chips was the best I've ever had. Breading was thin and the fish was flavorful. Also had the crab dip which was great but ask for a substitute for the fried pita bread... That stuff is awful! We ended up using our dinner rolls.
2875,"Had dinner here the other night.  It was our first night in town and we really didn't know where to go but we wanted to watch the game and we saw this place.  The location is great so it has that going for it but when we walked in the smell is something that I don't know how to describe.  We almost need up not staying but you get used to it after a bit. 

The food choices are typical pub food.  Nothing outstanding about it.  Its an okay place but there are so many other options in the area that I probably would make this a lower option.  It wasn't bad, its just that I know there are probably some better options.  We did watch the game and there are plenty of televisions so no matter where you sit you have a good view."
2876,"This place was the worst excuse for a restaurant. After being told that half of the things on the menu were ""out of stock"", we waited for bread which was never received due to ""it being an inconvenience to the kitchen"", went to the bar for our own waters, waited over a half hour for our appetizers and when our meals were finally brought to us - it was freezing cold (because at the ripe time of 5pm they had experienced ""a huge rush"") - we were one of four parties in the dining area. When we asked for the manager on duty, we were told there was nothing they could do about our freezing cold meals because we were ""rude and snarky"". We were perfectly reasonable. To conclude, we paid and left and went to dinner somewhere else. Do not go to this restaurant unless you have children that are ordering grilled cheeses. However, be warned, they might be out of cheese."
2877,Only gave it one star because I had to- it's a minus 10. Just arrived in Portland and was STARVING- somehow found this place. Atmosphere is OK- service - OK- food terrible. Had the chili- looked and tasted foul. Had the prime rib special- swear it was a week old. My wife got the lobster- how could you screw up a lobster on the coast of Maine? They did- like rubber. She threw away the tail for Gods sake. Told the young waiter he was pretty good at it- there are 500 restaurants in the city- he should find one that he can be proud to work at. Don't go!
2878,"Went to the Old Port Tavern for a late lunch because it was on the harbor, it was open and it wasn't terribly expensive. We were the only people (4pm).

We ordered some beers. My friend got the wrong brew so it was on the house. For a starter we got some bruschetta, and it was pretty good, but something I could make at home, nothing special. 

I got a burger, medium rare, which was cooked perfectly, though the burger itself was again, nothing special. The cole slaw it came with however, was pretty flawless, deliciously crispy, tangy and flavorful. 

My friend had a chicken sandwich that he said was delicious. His fries were really good. 

The aquarium in the back of the room is a sight to see. Bring your beer, you will want to hang out and give it a good look. 

All in all, a good place for lunch. We paid $40 for both of us including tip. A little on the expensive side for a ""nothing special"" kind of place, but pricing is different in a touristy destination."
2879,"If you are starving and don't want to wait, this is where you will end up. Food is okay. Service is okay. Atmosphere is not up to par with what Portland has to offer."
2880,"Tried my first whole Maine lobster here. Food was good. Service was a little slow, but not unbearably so.  Would definitely go again."
2881,"I see so many mixed reviews! I guess it just depends on what you eat and who serves you. Had the boiled lobster and lobster bisque. Both were stellar. Lobster bisque had a bunch of lobster chunks in the soup. Our server Tanner was great. Definitely wasn't rude like some of the other reviews implied their servers were. The live music was really  fun too. Overall the experience was top notch. I never make reviews, but just had to write one to clear the air."
2882,Karaoke. Gets a good crowd for a Thursday. Mix drinks are ok....don't get a Long Island ice tea.
2883,Not terrible but you can definitely make better fish in your own kitchen and for less money. A little overpriced considering the quality. I didn't love it or hate it.
2884,"I stopped in here by chance - I was wondering around while waiting for my mail boat ride and got hungry. I ordered the lobster bisque and it was flavorful, full of lobster meat (no skimping here!) and filing. The staff was friendly, the service was quick and the place had a good vibe. Definitely worth a visit!"
2885,"Food was great and we lived the atmosphere but the service was not the best.  The fresh,  homemade fish sticks were phenomenal, the French Dip was delicious and the chicken parm was great!  We will be back but hopefully with a more attentive waiter. .. I questioned if he had gone home for the night more than once!"
2886,We went here for a late dinner. There were 6 of us. The drinks are good. Food was good. We all had the prime rib and it was good. The staff was friendly.
2887,Unique inside - I loved the fish tanks and coziness of the restaurant. Chowder wasn't my favorite (good flavor but not thick enough to my liking). Perfect place to get out of the cold weather for a while.
2888,Went when everywhere else in town was busy... Sat at the bar for an affordable app..crab cake was good slightly bland ... Prime rib crostinis were great... Liked the band... Felt like a dungeon or Vegas dive bar... Service was great!
2889,"Smallest lobster roll on the planet, and not a great beer selection."
2890,"The first red flag to me was that at 7p on a Friday night, the place was EMPTY! Walking thru Portland without a reservation  at various restaurants showed us that there was anywhere from 45 mins-1 hour wait.
We came across Old Port and their posted menu outside was everything we were looking for.  We went straight in and lo and behold, the place was empty. 
We were shown our seats and a young waiter asked us for our drink order.  No problems there.  He returned and asked us if we were ready to order. No explanation at all on the specials or other menu offerings.  He didn't appear confident about being a waiter and couldn't explain to me what Mexican Red Hat soup was, though he said it was his favorite.  Second red flag- He didn't write down our orders ( though the other waiter was writing his orders down)
My girlfriend ordered lobster bisque and stuffed haddock. I ordered buffalo chicken wings and the lobster roll.
After that, that's when the experience collapsed.
She got her soup (very good she said) and I got chicken tenders with BBQ sauce. I told our man that  I ordered chick wings, he replied I thought you ordered chicken tenders ( they don't sound similar to me). As my girlfriend had her soup, I waited.  
My chick wings arrived with no buffalo sauce and no blue cheese.  I flagged down our man and asked for them.  They arrived.  
So within 3 minutes of getting my wings, he returns with our main meal and hovered over me with the plate.  I asked him to set the meal on the other side of the table as I was not finished with my appetizer. 
When I got to the lobster roll it was lobster meat and a pink sauce, rather than mayo.  I took the lobster meat off of the hot dog bun as it was hard as a rock on the ends and you could see how the sauce had absorbed Into the meat so it obviously wasn't made fresh.
As soon as as forkful came to my mouth, you could smell the ""offness""of the meat. 
One bite and I put the fork down and said this is No good My girlfriend, took one bite and she took it out of her mouth. 
The stuffed haddock was overlooked, the lobster stuffing was greasy and was more turkey like stuffing then lobster. 
I returned the sandwich, told our man that the roll was no good and to remove the order from our bill.  He did.  
The experience was bad and the food was poor.  We looked at yelp when we first sat down and the reviews were split right down the middle.   I am siding with the lower end for this place."
2891,"Did I like this place...YES I DID.

During my first vacation in Maine, we decided to trek it up to Portland to check out the nightlife. Unfortunately, we went on a Sunday night and towards the end of the summer. This means not a whole lot was going on.

But we were hungry. So we found the Old Port Tavern. 

It was really early, about 8 pm. So we were the only ones in there. Aside from the employees, of course.

Our waiter was very friendly and made us feel welcome. I think his name is Jason. 

We each ordered a different platter. I forget what others got, but I ordered some Red Hot Dog and the Lobster Stew as an appetizer. I loved it. Big chunks of lobster.

We all ordered a round of the Shipyard Pumpkin Ale. Good Stuff."
2892,"Went to Portland for the day to walk around and we saw the sign for the Tavern checked out the menu and decided to give it a try.  

We started off with the stuffed mushrooms(probably the least favorite item ordered) and a lobster soup (friend said it was great)

For meals two ordered burgers and the last order a small special salad and the crab cakes.  Overall the food was good nothing to rave about but it did fill us up. 

The waitress was such a sweetheart and very attentive."
2893,Never again went there today for lunch . Gross food lazy employees overall dirty restaurant .
2894,"The Old Port Tavern has both a downstairs (restaurant/bar) and upstairs (billiards/lounge). Both have decent drinks, with decent prices. The restaurant is good, but the seating and atmosphere have more of a bar-style feel. Bathrooms are nice, and the staff works hard as well. Probably one of the safer bars since the bouncers are top-notch compared to other danceable locations.

Weekends are dance-hall oriented, with plenty of people who like the cheaper drinks and great light show. Doesn't pack in so tight like other dance halls in the area. Weekdays are karaoke nights, where a sizeable number of people show up to rock out on the mic (one of the best karaoke spots in the area). 

Great for groups of people to enjoy karaoke and drinks at night, food for tourists in the day. Overall a decent location."
2895,"We stumbled into Portland around 8 pm, famished.  We spent a while wandering around the main strip, trying to figure out where we should crash for dinner.

We passed the Old Port Tavern.  The manager stood outside and called us over, proffering menus.  Which was fine.  It seemed quiet, so we agreed to give it a try.  

We both ordered off the specials menu, and both our meals were more than acceptable.  Our server was super pleasant, and left us to our own devices, which is what we wanted.  I have a feeling that if we required more attention, she would have been happy to accommodate us as well.  

There was something especially cool about being able to order a glass of Allagash just miles from the brewery, as well.

I recommend it.  :)"
2896,"Absolutely amazing food, probably best lobster mac and cheese I've ever had.

However as a caveat its a bit pricier than I'd normally pay.  My Wife and I ate there twice while in town recently for a vacation and it was 50-60$ each visit (25-30$ a plate after tip is still pricier than I'd prefer).

Great atmosphere though, beautiful aquarium with tons of live corral."
2897,"Just wandered in here, but it turned out to be pretty good.  We had the fried haddock sandwich and fish & chips (also haddock).  The server was nice and the fish was tender and lightly battered."
2898,I ordered the Tuscan Alfredo Fettucine with lobster.  The entree is very big.   But the pasta was not very tasty.  There was too much Alfredo sauce and it was bland.
2899,"No, no, and no. I'd almost give this place a second star, except that I would never go back. 

Very hungry, I stopped with some friends on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The fact that not a single other table was filled should have tipped us off. The waitress was new, but that should not excuse poor service. She was slow, apathetic, and all around ineffective. Don't even get me started on the vacant-stare girl at the bar. 

We ordered an assortment of foods, and given the prices, were expecting high quality. When the food arrived, each dish was unattractive at best. I had ordered the roast beef with dipping sauce: when it arrived, the meat was completely grey, spotted here and there with some melted cheese that had gone cold. It was completely unappetizing. I managed to get through about 4 bites before I gave up and just ate the fries.  

The other girls got the lobster bisque- fairly good, the burger- nicely cooked, and a salad- unremarkable. 

SO? It wasn't quite Kitchen Nightmares worthy, but for the prices, you can absolutely find much better food in such a fun, great city. DON'T SETTLE!! 

My friend asked that I at least commend the restaurant on their choice of minted toothpicks. That was the highlight of the meal for her..."
2900,"For a place that looks tailor made for the night time crowd, this place was surprisingly kid friendly.  We went there for lunch with our two and five year olds. They loved the fish tanks. The server was awesome. So friendly!  Great service.  Very sociable with the little ones.  My kids split a kids order of pizza, which they kindly put on separate plates that were room temperature(you would be surprised how many places serve kid's food on piping hot dishes) cut into small slices already, sparing me the work.  I had a delicious lobster roll.  All is all, a nice place.  Ignore the bad reviews!  It is totally worth the trip!"
2901,"Best Chilli in the Old Port! It is downstairs, and there are no windows, but unless its a beautiful sunny afternoon, who cares? I've always had great service here. I enjoy watching the fish, or the game, and if there is something I'd rather watch, they change it if I ask. Its a great place to meet up for drinks, lunch, or a casual dinner. I will be back!"
2902,"Expected something decent based on other yelp reviews, a bit disappointing.  Food was okay and beer was fine. Service was subpar and I am not a picky person. The waitress spent most of my meal flirting with someone at the bar, an off duty waiter I believe.  There were several times when they made jokes about not getting the other patrons what they had asked for, seriously. Hope the owner is watching his staff; nice setting, nice location, poor service."
2903,"We just had a wonderful lunch at the Old Port Tavern, recommended to us by friends who raved about this restaurant a week ago.  We enjoyed an excellently prepared fish & chips and friendly service.  The dining room was practically empty when we arrived, and filled up quickly.  The lone server was efficient and accommodating.  

We are considering returning for dinner and were on Yelp to look for other options and were stunned to see such an unfavorable review since we and our friends on a separate occasion had such  awesome experiences here.  My husband said that this is the best fish & chips he's had in Maine...and we've been here for 2 weeks and this is our 6th visit to this wonderful State!  Don't let the previous review deter you.  Old Port Tavern is great!"
2904,"Last summer when I was on vacation in with my boyfriend, Old Port Tavern was our stop for dinner on our first night in Portland. This is the place were I found and fell in love with bacon wrapped scallops in maple syrup!!! We ate the scallops as our appetizer. For my entree, I had the half roasted chicken and mashed potatoes. When we first sat down to order i complained to my bf that i wasn't going to like anything here,.. boyyy was I wrong... our food turned out amazing! So amazing that we decided to come back for dinner on our last night there too. Our food the second time was just as good as the first."
2905,"Stand up against overcharging by avoiding this restaurant!

We ate in the restaurant section of this bar/restaurant in late July 2009.  When seated at about 7 p.m., there were just two other tables occupied and maybe 2-3 people at the bar -- which seemed very unusual for a Thursday night in the summer where every parking spot on the street for half a mile around was occupied and people were packed into restaurants and bars.

The Old Port Tavern's dinner specials menu specifically made out for this day -- even with the date written on the top -- listed a ""fried clam dinner, $14.95"" which was the whole point of choosing this place, since I was with some diners who didn't like seafood.

I ordered that and the waitress told me, ""Oh sorry, we don't have that dish.""  But, it was on the dinner specials menu and there obviously weren't a lot of people there to order them all before I got there.  Poor planning by the kitchen??  Deceptive...

We were with several children and found out the place does NOT have a children's menu.  The waitress said they could order off the bar specials menu -- which provides too much food at too high of a cost for kids.  For instance, the waitress immediately said they would NOT be able to make the hot dog plate with just one hot dog at a lower cost (it comes with two, plus fries, for $7).  Coupled with $1.75 for a soda, this restaurant found a way to charge $8.75 for what we needed to settle on as a ""kids meal.""

We ordered lemonade, which is a the straight-from-the-tap variety, and it was diluted too much, giving it a sour taste.  We asked for the lemonades to be exchanged for sodas, and the waitress -- who was coping a little attitude already with the clams and kids meal omission issues -- went to make the trade.  (We are not overly picky/fussy/high-maintenance diners...)

I also ordered an iced tea.  This wasn't the custom-made handcrafted variety, but the made-by-the-pitcher, nothing special iced tea -- which was fine -- until I saw the bill and learned this place charges you PER REFILL -- which was not announced anywhere -- on the menu, by the waitress, or otherwise.  (And the waitress was not helpful whatsoever concerning the clam special and kids menu issues, so the cap to the evening would have likely been a ""scene"" in disputing bill charges.)

Is it not industry standard for free refills on soft drinks?  If a restaurant has the policy to charge, is it asking too much to proactively tell the diner that there is an extra cost at the time they order a refill?  At $1.75 per approx. eight-ounce iced tea glass, this restaurant's hidden way to pad bills is a crime against diners.

For this reason alone, avoid this restaurant.

The hamburgers with fries ($6) ordered by two diners were adequate -- nothing bad/nothing special -- but the Cuban cheesesteak sandwich ($9) with fries was particularly good, as was the French onion soup ($6).  The latter two choices were the main positive qualities of this restaurant, and if I really had to dig, the fact the rolls were served warm and the votive candle on the table was already lit before we were seated, were two more ""positives.""

Overall, any restaurant:

-Charging refills for soft drinks

-Erroneously posting specials that they did not even have that day

-Not having a kids menu (or at least offering to make smaller versions of their menu choices at lower prices for kids)

-A waitress unable to be flexible

...does not deserve return visits.

Now I can see why the place was empty on a Thursday night.  Diner beware of the Old Port Tavern in Portland, Maine!"
2906,"This is my favorite BBQ place in the area. The food is consistent and they always have a a few blackboard specials. The cocktail menu has something for everyone and the beer list has a lot of local brews. The burnt end nachos are my FAVORITE. The smoked wings are great too. The ""chose two"" is a great option but it's a lot of food- make sure you're hungry! 

Definitely a must! I haven't tried the Stevens Av location in Portland, but I'm sure it's just as great."
2907,"Visited the OG location for the first time recently on a Sunday. They had just opened but it filled up quickly. We sat at the bar and had a drink and a BBQ plate each. There isn't as much food as I'd expect for the price, or maybe I should try something else next time... The food is good but doesn't stand up to the plethora of other amazing spots in the area."
2908,"110% recommend Elsmere BBQ! It's the best BBQ you will find in the Portland, ME! I lived in Texas for a year and ate my way around some BBQ and can honestly say - these guys throw down.

For the price and amount of food you get - you can't beat it! I've come alone, with one other person, and also in a group of 6. 

This place gets PACKED! I'd recommend going during off hours like between 2-4 pm on the weekends. If you order smart, you can average about $12 a person and try a little bit of everything.

Last time I went (with a party of 6), we ordered the Elsmere's Side Sample, The Works, and extra cornbread and it fed 5 of us very well. The 6th party member was selfish and didn't want to share their food (hahah jk)

This place is great for families and large groups! They have a private parking lot, but if it is filled there is ample parking along the street.

Down the road you can check out the headlight at Cape Elizabeth. 

Please, do yourself a favor, try Elsmere BBQ.

OH! I almost forgot - service is on point. Every time I've been there every single person I interacted with was friendly and funny. 

Enjoy!

oh wait wait! one more thing....smoke. rings. Yes...smoke. rings...mmmm :)"
2909,"We were sat watching the chefs. The service was really fast and not in the way of the meal. We got the Works and the sides sampler. Of all the meats, my favorite was the brisket. Perfectly fatty and well paired with the sauces. Once we tried each meat raw, we draped each with the sauces. Akin to the psychos that douse ketchup over their fries. The beans on the side could have used some more love, the sides seemed like a bit of an afterthought when they could so easily be amped up. 
Overall, definitely will go back. Good goooood meats."
2910,"We only came here for a couple of beers one afternoon.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartender was super friendly.

They have a nice selection of local beers, which is what we stuck with.  They also have a full bar.

The next time I visit Portland, I want to give their food menu a try."
2911,"Best brisket ever, amazing collard greens and the cornbread is so soft everything was very delicious!! Friendly staff and very chill atmosphere they play good music too. Love this place"
2912,The collard greens are outstanding. I usually get a half rack of ribs and a double order of collard greens. Sometimes I get the 3 sides and cornbread for $10 if I'm not that hungry. Solid BBQ. The sauces are great. They have a mustard that is unique and outstanding. The cocktails are well made. Over poured does not equal great and our cocktails were balanced. Good beer selection too. We'll worth the visit.
2913,"Elsmere has good food, but the atmosphere is not for me. Loud and dark, it's more of a sports bar than a causal dinner spot. Also, my meal arrived after about an hour! Granted, it was crowded- even at 7:30 on Tuesday! 

The redeeming quality was the food. For $18.00 I got blackened catfish; a generous fillet of moist, flakey fish with a kick of Cajun spices and salt. It came with cornbread and coleslaw, which is more acidic than the usual sweet and creamy taste. Corn bread? More like corn cake! Sweet, spongey, and crumbly yet not dry, the corn bread felt like an indulgent treat. This meal definitely hit the spot. 

Will I be back? Probably not, as the food is a bit pricey and it's not my scene. However, I did thoroughly enjoy my dinner."
2914,"Place is ayight...  but:

If you are in the mood for BBQ, go to Salvage.

Salvage is much, much better.

Some reviews have gone very far to say Best BBQ in Maine.

I beg to differ."
2915,"Delicious food and a good locations for families, as it is somewhat dark and a little loud.  There are a lot of options on the menu and everything we ordered tasted delicious."
2916,"After viewing the BEAUTY of Maine, and with Keto being killed days ago (insert Homer Simpson voice....hmmmm carbs), the family went to see the Portland Lighhouse (A MUST). As we left, the hunger pains set in our 2 little monsters so this place was selected. First, parking is not good and a sign tells you to respect the residential parking. The establishment does have some in the back. The sitting area is small yet that is where the negatives end. If you select this place, your taste buds are in for a tremendous treat. The kids were punched by an Atkins glove and wanted ribs and the restaurant's menu had them in kids size. We saw the smoked wings and ordered those to start off our meal. Honey called upon her inner Hispanic ordered a quesadilla with beef. Finally, I ordered...YUP Ribs! Kids order came out 1st and it was a huge portion with 4 ribs and side. An amazing thing happened on our table like Haley's comet appearance, the ribs were so good that our 2 monsters didn't talk at all and behaved while eating-needless to say they channeled their inner pirana and ate them all up. The wings came out and we added the Korean seasoning. Let me tell you though they were temperature hot, the flavor was unexplainably delicious (insert champagne being opened and exploding all over-this is a MUST). The ribs were tender with such a strong smoke taste in each bite....while the quesadilla was also complimented well with the beef and onion stir inside of it. As you can see, 2 thumbs up with fireworks in the back yet I would be remissed if I did not tell you how good the corn bread tasted. The wait staff and food made it an awesome experience."
2917,"The food here is fantastic. Among the best pulled pork and brisket I've had. Their cole slaw is quite vinegar heavy which is not a bad thing. I just prefer it a little creamier but it was yummy all the same. The beans were delicious and we also ordered the grilled corn which was a daily special, and it was delish! The atmosphere is great with an open, inviting kitchen. The only thing preventing a 5 star review is their seats. They are tiny metal things and if you happen to be large in stature they are akin to a torture device. The side bars dig into the thighs and it's impossible to get comfortable. We had to ask to move to a high top. And the high top seats are not much better.
Management, please upgrade your seats for us fatties!"
2918,"So I don't know what is going on in Elsmere. We know the owner. Have had multiple family functions here. New manager is horrible. Basically if you are a party under 4 you won't get served until they send someone home. Specifically they had a booth open for 25 minutes and won't put a family of 3 there until they send a server home. Unbelievable! I have had a bar mitzvah part, after Thanksgiving party and have supported since they opened. And you know what was worse was that she was ride about it. Very disappointing in a local business who has a new unprofessional person running the front end. ."
2919,"Maybe I was just spoiled with living in the Austin area where the official Texas BBQ Trail runs around.. This place praised itself on Texas style bbq on their Twitter and website and being a new resident of Maine... I was excited to try this place out. 

Service was great and I liked the set up of the restaurant as well as their beer selection. The meats just didn't hit the spot compared to the ones down in Texas though.. Everything was extremely dry and bland with the exception to the collard greens which had a nice twang to them taste wise. Brisket was very dry, sausage appeared to have been nearly dried out over the fire as no juices were really present. Rice and beans... No flavor or seasoning seemed to be present. The ribs were juicy... But no flavor in these either. I'd expect to taste a little bit of the dry rub on the meats.. Salt... Pepper... Anything... But nothing! 

Maybe we caught then at an off time, but for what we got.. I don't know if I'll venture back. I'm eager to try a few other bbq places in the area before that happens."
2920,"We went here on 3/20/18. Who'd think on a Tuesday in the spring( ok late winter) that the place would be packed? 
There was a fundraiser for adopting older dogs. Don't get me wrong, I admire people who adopt ANY dog, but older dogs require a special love. It's a love that is unfortunately short lived. I was happy that a portion of our bill was going to this great cause. 
HOWEVER, I feel if you are going to host a fundraiser at your restaurant perhaps you should reserve a few tables for those of us who were unaware of any such gathering and perhaps they did, I'm not sure, but it seemed like most of the patrons knew each other, again perfectly fine and it was great to see such support for the dogs. 
We were a party of 4 and when we arrived we were told it was going to be a 20 min. wait. Ok, that's not bad, we'll wait. An hour later, we were seated, luckily at a very roomy table. Thirsty and starving, we immediately ordered drinks and an order of Thai spiced wings. They were fabulous. We all ordered something different and it was all really great bbq. It was not my first time here, but it had been a few years since I'd been. I don't think I will wait that long to return. Especially if they support older dog adoptions."
2921,"The best barbecue in the State of Maine PERIOD. I've been to at least 7 other spots around the state and none even come close to Elsmere. 

* Pulled pork usually tastes about the same at most joints - like it's good but it's good everywhere. It never stands out. Here it's killer. Moist and tangy. Plenty of bark mixed throughout. 

* Best brisket I've had out, bar none. I smoke my own meats and have done a fair share of briskets and 99% of the time I prefer my own to what you'll find at a restaurant. Well these guys just nail it. Best brisket I can find at a bbq joint around here. Sliced the right way, tender and juicy.

* Ribs always seem like the forgotten meat at bbq places. They come off pretentious, expensive and just seem like a gamble most of the time with the chances of getting dried out, over-smoked, over-spiced ribs being far greater than finding a good rack. 
Well these guys nail these too. Perfect texture - moist but not fall off the bone. Spiced perfectly with a rub, not covered in sauce. Also what makes these stand out is that they don't have a heavy smoke flavor. The smoke is light and the porks flavor holds its own. There's also plenty of bark which tastes amazing.

When I'm not smoking I'm at Elsmere."
2922,"Had the pulled pork sandwich - really good and tender. I liked the coleslaw without the mayo, great job. We also had the chicken BBQ - was very good. Great service!"
2923,"The best parts: 

The brisket and chicken- amazing! Gluten-free buns are a bonus, yes!

The undesirable: 

The coleslaw soup! That's what it was in reality! It came in a small bowl and half of it was vinegar! Come on, I'm OK with a vinegary vs a traditional creamy slaw but at least scoop it out with a slotted spoon!

I ordered a sandwich and it's served right on paper on a tray. Because of the grease and sauce  the paper quickly got soggy. I would prefer it be on an actual plate, paper plate is OK, but please not just on paper.

I would like to give them another try because the chicken and brisket was so good, and maybe will ask for a plate!"
2924,"An old service station, reminiscent of Joe's BBQ  I visited in Kansas City, Kansas. Walked in and looked spacious and comfortable. The staff was nice and courteous. 
Started with some nachos and they were quite delicious. The main course was very good. The rib meat fell off the bone and was very flavorful. The sausage and brisket were very smoky and juicy. The beans and rice had a lot of good flavor and were not dry at all. The greens had just enough vinegar (not a fan of vinegar) and tasted great. 
The server was very attentive and was there when needed. 
Overall it was a good experience and great food."
2925,"Elsmere has significantly improved since our last visit! We attended a recent charity fundraiser. Pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage were all fresh and delicious, properly smoked, tender and flavorful. Cornbread sides were generous and tasty. The kitchen staff was working hard to put out quality meals and it showed. Our seats provided a good view of the prep area. Chefs were professional. A high degree of teamwork was visible. 
The service was attentive and efficient. Our server was friendly and engaged. She was knowledgeable regarding the beer selection, including guest taps and made informed, accurate recommendations. Plates were cleared quickly and other servers ran food and drinks as they came up. 
The environment was enjoyable, even with a full house. The temperature was comfortable on a cool night. The volume level was just right, bustling but good for conversations. Lighting was nice. Parking remains tight. Pro tip: Park on a side street and respect the neighbors. I am encouraged by this experience, upgrading my previous review, and putting Elsmere back on the list for good BBQ. Notably, beer prices have not increased in two years, a very good thing! The beer selection is tight, and focused on quality local craft. Pints were fresh and served at correct temperatures. I look forward to a return visit. They are now getting it right on food, service, craft beer, environment and value."
2926,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it here. I've had great barbecue in Kansas City and other places and was cautious about whether not I would like it. They very much surprised me! We got the outlaw nachos to start with and that was awesome and truly should be enough to split with someone for meal with a beer. But no... I also ordered a two meat combo with brisket and chicken. The chicken was amazing and the brisket was good too. I really enjoyed the red beans and rice and the mac & cheese was OK. The cornbread was also very yummy! I also had a prickly pear margarita which was awesome and a little bit sweet I like that though.
We took A ton home and our server even suggested having the cornbread with the brisket and two eggs on top for breakfast the next day! What a great suggestion!"
2927,Delicious food in a cool casual atmosphere. I had the flatbread with pulled pork - so delicious. My husband had brisket and chicken. Both were really good - the chicken was over the top delicious. Good friendly service and good beer selection too.
2928,"Great BBQ food, service and atmosphere! Went here for Father's Day as wanted to try a new BBQ restaurant. Drove up from NH, it was worth the drive. We sat at the bar and Jane took great care of us, helped with choices and made a killer cocktail, Prickly Pear! Ordered the BBQ oysters, burnt end nacho's and wings for apps - loved them all. Then we had the works, side sampler and full rack of ribs! The works is a lot of food but loved every bite, it is one of each meat, sausage, pulled pork, brisket, ribs and chicken. The chicken was the big surprise, best we've had anywhere. Ribs were very flavorful and moist, the sauces were perfect compliment to the rub on the ribs. Great bark on the meat, brisket was excellent.
We have been to BBQ in many places including KC and St. Louis but this was as good as any of those places. They showed us the smoker at Elsmere too, nice touch. We will be back."
2929,"This is a great little neighborhood restaurant. Warm and cozy from the giant wood fired grill. Big bar with some good beer selecti9ns and interesting cocktails. And the menu has a fine selection of wood fired BBQ and seafood. I had wood fired oysters and a giant Caesar salad topped with grilled salmon. The Mac and cheese looked so good I had a side of that too. My companion had mahi mahi tacos, which she liked. It's not a bargain. But the food has  consistently good southern comfort selections. I will definitely be back."
2930,"This was the first place my boyfriend and I got food from during our trip to Portland. Standard.. little overpriced.. but not bad if you are in South Portland area craving BBQ. Pulled pork was okay. Mac and cheese was simple but hit the spot. Rice and beans was bombbb. And thats about it. 

Not my fave but wouldn't hate getting takeout from there again."
2931,My boyfriend and I go here once a month or so and we LOVE it! The food is always consistently great and the service is awesome as well. Definitely would recommend!
2932,"The BBQ is a bit dry for my preference and the prices are a bit too high for what you receive for food. Staff were attentive and friendly though, so that certainly helps."
2933,"When first walking into Elsmere you instantly smell BBQ and it smells delicious. There were only two of us and they put us at the ""bar"" seating, where you watch the chefs in the kitchen. The view is nice, but it would have been nice to be asked if we wanted to sit there. The chairs are very uncomfortable and there should be a bar or something to put your feet on when sitting here. The waitress came right away and asked what we wanted to drink. We ordered our drinks and then ordered the nachos with the chili on them, the ribs with coleslaw and Mac and cheese, and the tornado burrito with Mac and cheese. The nachos were very good and the chili also had great flavor. The ribs were cooked perfectly. The tornado burrito was awesome. It was like nothing I have ever had before, with great flavor. I highly recommend this. The Mac and cheese was lacking flavor and needed salt, it just didn't seem very cheesy. The coleslaw I liked, but it is not your typical coleslaw (it has a vinegar base). We were so full we couldn't try the desserts. We will return when we are craving BBQ again."
2934,"Food was great and the service was even better. Went with my mother for lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't very busy, so we were able to ask a lot of questions. They have a decent draft selection, always important! :-) the Mac & cheese was sooooo good!!!! Creamy, cheesy, gooey, amazingness in a bowl! (The rest of the food was pretty good too). The spicy mustard sauce is delicious and the sweet red sauce was very yummy!"
2935,"Once again I had an amazing dinner at Elsmere.  I had the pulled pork flat bread and it is packed with flavor.  The pulled pork is sweet, tender & plentiful.  I wanted to devour the entire flat bread but I couldn't.  They also hosted the rescue I volunteer for & are very accommodating to our needs.  The staff is fabulous.  Thank you Elsmere!"
2936,"I love this place.  We live close by and we come in often enough that I know its not just that first time love that fails you when you return.  The menu offers plenty of options,  I am in LOVE with their BBQ chicken.  The wings, chicken tacos and ribs are SO good.  You cannot go wrong with the atmosphere and we absolutely love the staff.  

P.S...Its kind of hard to blame the restaurant on ""parents"" letting their kids run around with no supervision.  That is a delicate situation, you cannot as an employee or manager scold a customers child, risking your job and having a Marcy's Diner situation possibly brew.  That is a really unfair reason to negatively review a place that works hard to supply and enjoyable experience for ALL people who come in.  Review on their food, their prices, their staff but on something completely out of their control?  Not fair."
2937,"Food is fair.  Unfortunately people bring their children here and let them run around the restaurant screaming, while others are trying to eat.  The parents of the children, meanwhile, are drinking and having a good time.

Ahhhhhhh, Adam P.  family friendly is fine, but not at the expense of other patrons who want to relax."
2938,"My first try with Elsmere. I used the 2DineIn app, and the delivery was excellent, and the food was hot and prepped properly for delivery. 

I tried a bit of everything....the sausage appetizer is plenty for two to share....I enjoyed the juiciness and texture of the sausage, and it pared well with a mustard based sauce. There was a spice component...unnamed by me with my three bites, that was a bit off put with the sausage.

The baby back ribs were perfectly cooked....the star of my meat selection for my palate....delicious without sauce....that flavorful, and perfectly smoked.  The brisket was also flavorful.....I prefer a much thinner slicing application with brisket....this is much thicker, almost block like....but it was tasty and moist with a nice smoke ring. I bet it would rock with thinner slicing. The pulled pork was decent also....but it didn't stand out flavor or texture wise. 

My sides didn't score as high....the beans were cooked well....but I wasn't a fan of the cumin and citrus flavor profile....a bit too island flavor like for my taste...it just seemed off with the bbq smells and sauces. Same with the collard greens....not enough seasoning to enhance the flavor for me.

All in all....a very good effort. I will give them 4 stars on my first dining here....the price point for this good food is somewhat high, but good food and quality prep and ingredients costs more, which is reflected here. Decent overall effort."
2939,"Absolutely delicious! The homemade  BBQ sauces are amazing...they should sell them! Customer service was great, cool bar, etc. Definitely coming back."
2940,"Elsmere is a solid neighborhood restaurant. I've ordered takeout and have sat at the bar for dinner a few times. I'm definitely a fan of their burger, the korean bbq wings, and the collard greens. Unfortunately the bbq itself doesn't make me exceptionally excited, but I definitely enjoy coming here for beer and an appetizer. 

They have parking in the back and it is busy on Friday night...so be prepared to wait or fight for a seat at the bar!"
2941,"My group of friends and I were celebrating a birthday and made a reservation for 8 over a week in advance. When we arrived to the restaurant they told us that our reservation was cancelled and that we weren't going to be seated for another half an hour. We did not cancel this reservation. If it were easy for 8 people to walk into any restaurant and sit down we would have left but since it is not, we waited. The manager did apologize which we appreciated but when we were finally seated the service we received was quite poor and the food was mediocre."
2942,"The food wasn't inedible but it was very, very close.

It should be noted that I came here and didn't get BBQ food (meat), but I had the vegetarian options.. However, if the food is on the menu, whether it be vegetarian food at a BBQ joint or not, you should still cook it/prepare it right!

Anyway, I had the black bean veggie burger and it was terrible. Hard as a rock, dry as a bone. It was hands down the worst one I've ever had. I had a side of beans and rice with it and it was just as a bad. I also had some of the collard greens and they weren't anything to talk about either.

The service was good, but it couldn't make up for the meal."
2943,"Fantastic barbecue spot in South Portland.  We started with the smoked wings, which were delicious. Then I moved onto one of the plates with two meats... The meats I chose were brisket and sausage and both were absolutely wonderful. The sauces are spot on as well.  My sides were collard greens, mac & cheese, and rice and beans... All really good.  The icing on the top though was the spectacular service. We had a wonderful waitress. -- she was very accommodating and suggested fabulous cocktails from the menu. I was surprised by this place because it's in kind of out-of-the-way location, but I will definitely be back!"
2944,"Well this was certainly a mixed bag. The ambiance was good. They were out of the beer option I wanted, so I got a mixed drink instead. It was so good, I got a second with the meal. Our menu options were limited as they ran out their signature Brisket as a main course. 

So I had settle for a different option, the chili. It was among the best chili I have ever eaten. The Cole Slaw had a bit more vinegar than I would make myself. 

The server, Michelle, was efficient, friendly and apologetic. When it came to dessert choices, they were out of the blackboard item Key Lime Pie. Settled for a well made, but sweet Maine Whoopie Pie. Coffee was excellent. 

So the food that was available was well prepared and delicious. When you run out a blackboard item, erase it. If I don't see it, I can't be disappointed, if you don't have. 

I'll come back, but I will call and check to see if they have the menu items available. If Elsmere doesn't have them, I am likely to go elsewhere."
2945,"Arrived with a party of 5 and were seated promptly . I ordered a  glass of house red which was quite good and only $5 as it was happy our. My son ordered the brisket, his girlfriend ordered the salad with grilled chicken. My daughter ordered the chicken sandwich and her boyfriend ordered the mushroom burrito (vegan). I ordered  the  fish tacos (gluten free). Everything was delicious. The place was a bit too noisy but the foods makes it worth it. Our server met all of our needs but wasn't as personable as we might have expected. Three out of five of us are in ""the business"", so we tend to expect much more in the area of customer service. Portions were large and 2 of us took home leftovers . We will keep coming back for the yummy food!"
2946,"Not sure why I waited till my last night in S. Portland to try out this place.  The food is decent... the ribs are excellent - i like them dry and add the bbq sauce to my taste.  I know most BBQ places will join parties together at a bigger table, but I think they should at least inform the guest / customers at the table, and not make them feel awkward.
Food: BBQ excellent tender meat, salty collard greens (but we aren't in the south), weird vinegaretty BBQ beans... average mac and cheese, and corn bread
Atmosphere: Loud, but it was a Saturday night"
2947,"Do yourself a favor and do not miss out on Elsmere's. The flavorful, fall off the bone, ""pretty pink smoke ring"" meat is just what you are looking for when you search ""bbq"". 

We enjoyed a fabulous lunch/dinner/supper this Sunday. The location is conveniently in between South Portland and Portland Head Light at Fort Williams. There is a parking lot behind the restaurant, as well as parking across the street at the doctor's office on Sundays. 

The menu is just what you would expect from a Northern bbq place, options and prices included. Every sauce and meat is delicious, however my favorites were the ribs covered in their mustard based sauce. I was so full from my two meat platter, that I had basically a whole meal to take home as leftovers. My fiance however housed his entire plate. Everything we tried was high quality and flavorful, although the cole slaw based in vinegar and green peppers was not really my fave. The only request to the menu would be some eggy potato salad. 

Our service was quick, considerate, and pleasant. The restaurant decor is beautiful as well with painted white walls accompanied with industrial looking lighting and a cool behind the bar neon autobody shop sign. Speaking of the bar, the drink list will please anyone in your party with ample local beer selections paired for BBQ as well as creative infused cocktails. There were drink specials as well as an advertised happy hour Tues - Fri. And if you are in the mood for outdoor, there is a patio with umbrellas.

They even have homemade desserts, but unfortunately our guts were too busted from the entrees to partake. Here's to hoping we can go back for some nachos and pie next time!"
2948,"I personally like the ribs the most... though other bbq meats are not bad. 

Wouldn't say it's the best bbq we've had, but food is generally very tasty. It is a great option for dinner in the neighborhood if you don't want to drive into Portland. It's one of our regular places outside of Portland for easy simple dinner with families and friends. 

Would recommend it for a fun gathering place with decent food."
2949,"I would like to take you on an inspirational pork journey if you will: today Matt and I were discussing how cool it is to see the people you used to know grow up and succeed, open businesses, become community figures, and lead badass lives which brought us to Elsmere, a restaurant opened by someone Matt used to roadie for (yeah, we were young and crazy once). 

Upon first impression the logo is so cool, there's a retro feel to the entire place, AND THERES AMPLE PARKING! Yippee! We sat at the bar which is a salvaged neon radiator shop sign adorned with dark wood and houses an eclectic mix of standard bar liquor and a seriously cool selection of craft beers (and of course PBR, if that's your jam). 

The drink menu was great and the signature cocktails scream ""YAAAAAAAASSSSSS!"" I got Rosemary's Baby. A Hendricks, rosemary syrup, grapefruit, and soda water delight. Matt tried every beer you could imagine. Seriously. We were there forever. 

What struck me here Was the forethought about service, steam tables and a prep line are visible to the dining area and meals are ready SO QUICKLY. it was outstanding. Really, I was so pleased. 

I ordered pulled pork, Mac and cheese, rice and beans, and each meal come with cornbread. The food was great! I wasn't a fan of the rice and beans alone, but they would make a badass burrito filling. The pork was juicy and tender, well seasoned, and the Mac was good, remember it's a side dish, so it's wasn't like... ""I'm going to marry that chef"" good, but it paired with the meal really well. 

We finished the meal with rhubarb cheesecake pie and it was PHENOMENAL. You could tell it was made from scratch.

The entire experience was great, we were there for an hour and a half (we kept drinking, our food was out within 20 minutes of entering the place) and spent $73 on two massive meals, dessert, and at least five drinks. That's not bad for Portland prices (and I drank top shelf, I was so excited to see Hendricks in an $8 tier!). 

We will definitely return, as this may be our new date night jam."
2950,"Came in for a quick snack before seeing a show. Waits recommended the side sampler. Great suggestion! Good mac and cheese, beans, corn bread and some others. Understood we wanted to be in and out but didn't rush us or treat us differently. Would definitely return."
2951,"Was here randomly for happy hour at 4-6pm so the drafts were $2 off.  Place has a nice atmosphere with an amazing wood fire kitchen.  Ordered the wings, cole slaw, collard greens and sampler meat plate.  All the meats we're hot and super dry.  Seems as tho they reheat the meat they previously cook.  Pulled pork and cole slaw was my favorite.  Service and hostess were great!"
2952,"We have been here twice in the past and I had a coupon to use. Great atmosphere and it smelled amazing in there. 

Food: Between the folks at our table we had wings w/ hot sauce (pretty good..used extra from the table), salmon sammy (pretty good), three meat combo (Ribs, Pork, Sausage). The three meat is where things went downhill pretty fast. Ribs and pork were very dry. Sausage was pretty good. Used a TON of sauce, which for a texas style bbq place should not really be necessary. Kind of worried about reheating leftovers or it might be jerky. 

Service: Waitstaff was friendly...food took quite a while for a 1/3 full restaurant, especially for BBQ. 

Verdict: With other BBQ offerings in the area, this place moved close to the bottom of our BBQ list. Compared to today, even the chain BBQ is better. Redemption from 2 stars were the sauces which were all amazing!"
2953,Place was a hidden gem. Food was fantastic and our waitress Michelle was great. Cozy dining area and a great bar
2954,"It was okay. The atmosphere was neat. It is small but works well. You can watch them cook and the bar area is cool looking. Our waitress was nice and was great on getting everything out to us in a timely manner and it was a busy night. As for the food, I liked the cornbread, it had real corn in it. Their cole slaw was too vinegary for me. I like sweet cole slaw, so I won't fault them on that, because others may like a more tart flavor. The pull pork was good and I really liked their brisket. We also tried their nacho plate and I really liked that they serve it with the condiments on the side, in their own little bowls. That's great, because not everyone likes sour cream, salsa or guacamole piled on top of their nachos...that was huge for us! We also tried their brownie sundae, that was delicious and was huge! My husband and I shared and there was more than enough dessert for the two of us. I did have one drink, Long Island Iced Tea and it was a bit weak. The company we were with had one too and he said the same thing. I'm not sure if this is a place I would return to, but if someone wants to go there, I would. I did see other things on the menu that I would like to try."
2955,"Excellent BBQ and Smoked Meats to soothe a Southern Heart.  


Tried the ribs, the mac and cheese, cole slaw and cornbread. 

The ribs were aromatic, so deliciously smoky and perfectly seasoned.  Super tender and flavorful, with very little effort the meat fell right from the bone.  Opted for the red Texas sauce, a slightly sweet BBQ sauce that perfectly complimented the meat.  You can tell that care was taken in preparing them, they were done right.  

The Mac and Cheese was perfectly cooked, not overdone/overcooked and bland like so many other places, was slightly smoky as well, could have used maybe a touch more salt but extremely tasty.  

Cornbread was soft, slightly sweet and I loved the chewy caramelized bits of corn flecked throughout.  

Wasn't a fan of the cole slaw, I think that's personal preference. It was sour/vinegary and had jalapeños in it, not the kinda of cole slaw I'm used to eating. However, I think the sour/vinegar is probably a great choice to cut through the richness of all the meat and mac & cheese.  

I grew up in the South and this meal tugged at all my heartstrings.  I felt like I was back home. 


Keep it up guys, you are doing excellent things there!"
2956,"Fantastic St. Louis style ribs. Not your heavily sauced stuff, but slow smoked. Same for the baked beans, a favorite of mine being from the South. Not a mess sticky beans in BBQ, but slow simmered, smokey beans you'd expect over a Texas campfire.

The service was the best part however with a sweetheart of a server. Smiling, funny, sharp and attentive. A group of 6, with drinks for everyone, appetizers and full meals came in around $140. Not bad at all and I can't wait to go back!"
2957,"I love simple barbecue made with quality meats, and Elsmere's did not disappoint. 

Friday evening; it was very busy, yet I waited only 15 or 20 minutes for a table - not a hassle at all, considering they offer a FREE PAC-MAN machine! Good beer selection, including new offerings from Banded Horn, which was nice. We sat at the ""kitchen bar,"" right along the open kitchen, face-to-face with the staff (I will recommend requesting this, as it was the warmest seat in the house). They moved efficiently and communicated well, resulting in our food arriving more quickly than I thought it would.

I chose the St. Louis style ribs, brisket, and house-made sausage; and the sausage, to me, was the star, with excellent spice and a satisfying snap from the casing. For sides, the mac & cheese and vinegar-based slaw were very good. My daughter chose a pulled pork sandwich topped with mac & cheese, and it was very good (if not messy). Thee were plenty of offerings on the menu, including a veggie burger. 

An added treat was being taken by one of the owners, Jeremy, to see the smoker - he offered to do so as we chatted at the kitchen bar (he was on the line). Also met the other owner, Adam, in the smoke room. You could sense the pride and excitement in their voices over what they were adding to the local food scene. Our server, Mikayla (sp?), was cheerful and attentive - smiles from everyone we dealt with. 

Given the good prices and laid-back atmosphere, we will definitely be returning to Elsmere's to sample more of the offerings - especially in the summer when outdoor seating will be available!"
2958,"I was a little skeptical about this place after reading some reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. I considered 4 starts but can't think of a single complaint. I was definitely impressed and will be going back regularly. 

Four of us went in on a Friday night, the host greeted us immediately and said there would be about a 20 minute wait. We got drinks at the bar which was warm and inviting and had a great cocktail list and beer selection. I noticed a lot of weekly specials too, like whiskey Wednesdays (YES!), happy hours, and vodka oyster shooters. 

We were seated in just about 20 minutes in a nice comfy booth and service was excellent. I really liked the atmosphere too. Open and clean. 
Our waitress gave us detailed specials, recommendations, explained sauces, attention to our drinks... And immediately put in our appetizer order. 

Now for the food, OMG delicious and came out quickly. Had the roasted oysters which were the best oysters I've ever had. They were even willing to split the sauce flavors within the half dozen. I had grilled mahi mahi tacos which came with a choice of side- I got the collard greens (vegetarian!) and corn bread. Everything was so freaking good. I could have eaten a bucket of those collard greens and the corn bread was very light, not dense. Price was completely reasonable $16- for the meal. My friend got pulled pork which he said was delicious and not dry at all. Came out on big pie plates lined in parchment as well like the traditional southern BBQ. 

Needless to say, can't wait to go again!"
2959,"Unsanitary and unfriendly and inappropriately behaved  staff, food is mediocre at best. It's hard to make bad BBQ, so if this is all you do it should be top notch. Maybe a trip or two down south would  enlighten the cooks on preparation, sauces, and flavor. Best thing in the place is the redone neon sign."
2960,"Had been wanting to go here for a long time and thanks to a Localvore coupon finally made it in. Not a big cornbread dude, but seemed decent; mac and cheese also decent, but why waste precious room in your stomach with things like that. You come here for the meat treats that come out of the smoker and so you should.

Brisket-awesome, ribs-fall off the bone awesome, chicken- there might be crack in it, I don't know, but I've been dreaming about it all morning and really wishing I hadn't inhaled the leftovers as soon as I got home. Wings (we ate a lot of meat) were also excellent and huge. Great beer selection - Bunker, Banded Horn, Maine Beer, a gross pumpkin beer, something for everybody and a pretty bangin drink menu too.

Lauren at the bar took amazing care of us. Somehow totally missed the (free?) Galaga arcade game, like we needed another reason to go back."
2961,"Hitting this spot after a mediocre second visit to Salvage with a couple buddies, I was singularly unimpressed. 

The atmosphere on this early Saturday evening was busy and energetic with a fast paced kitchen crew using a huge wood fired grill. 

A system using multiple kitchen staff and large prepared pans allowed for quick plating of dishes. 

The brisket was dry and over smoked. It lacked any noticeable flavor component that would warrant a repeat sampling. Low fat content and minimal juiciness did not help the cause. 

The ribs were on the smaller side and also were not particularly noticeable. I have had worse ribs - Norms East Ender - but not frequently. Tough, sinewy meat had a charred exterior that was difficult to cut through and did not pull away from the bone. 

Unimpressive sides as well. 

A loss in my book, maybe with time they'll figure out how to regulate the smoke system better."
2962,"I went to two BBQ places this week. One was Salvage and here. I bought a localvore coupon that was 30 dollars off your bill. 

I past this place so many times while biking to Cape Elizabeth and I didn't even give it a thought to try it. But I am really happy I did. 

We ordered two beers, an appetizer, one burger and I had Chicken with two sides and corn bread. 

The wings we ordered for a starter were delicious and they came out really quick. One small disappointment we had was that our waitress got one of our beers wrong and gave us a shipyard summer instead of the oxbow/bunker collaboration pilsner. It was really loud in the restaurant to I imagine it's easy to mishear. 

For my sides I ordered mac and cheese and collard greens. The mac and cheese was pretty bland and could have used more salt. The collards were pretty good not as salty which is great. 

The chicken was pretty good as well

You can Definitely have a decent time here."
2963,"By far my favorite place in the Portland area for BBQ food. The brisket is fantastic as are the Mac and cheese and cornbread. The atmosphere is cozy and very inviting. It's not a huge place but that makes it all the more inviting. The beer selection is local and also very accommodating whatever your taste may be. Go try it if you're in the area, you won't regret it"
2964,"People are nuts on here sometimes. I wanted to reads why this place only has 3.5 stars, and someone gave it 1 star because their service was slow. Another because it costs a couple more dollars per sandwich. That's terrible! Now when other people are looking for great BBQ, they are thrown off by ratings that are skewed. Service is slow? Ok, take a star or 2, because it is important. To pricy for you? That's what the dollar sign ratings are for. Really to bad. 

As far as food quality? Excellent! Burnt end chili nachos had so much tasty toppings we had to eat the left overs with a fork. Someone complained these didn't come with guac. Well, this is a BBQ restaurant, use the amazing BBQ sauces they have on the table. Go to El Rayo for guac. The wings weren't very big, but great quality chicken. Minimum amount of grizzle on the ends. I had the tornado sandwich with pretzel roll. I think it comes with 3 different meats? All so very tender and tasty! I agree that it is a little pricey, but that's only because it comes with a side of potato chips in stead of fries, slaw or mashed pots. But for an added price, I believe you can get all of those sides.

All in all, great atmosphere, friendly staff, we had no issues at all with service, and food was great quality. I will return again.

PS - I love how Yelp! tells me I wrote the pants off this review. Ha! I feel a little shy right now..."
2965,"The best place between Portsmouth and Portland for service, honest BBQ (just ate smoked meatballs-don't bother amazing), and BEST drinks !!!!!! Especially, the pumpkin sangria!!!"
2966,"I had gone to Salvage on its opening day and it was absolutely terrible (I still need to give it another shot), so I patiently waited until yesterday to try Elsmere.

K and I pulled into the small parking lot of the former auto garage around 5 pm. There are maybe 10 tables in the restaurant and a decent sized bar. The highlight behind the bar is a giant glowing neon sign from the old garage. There were several tvs showing sports (soccer?) and a board hung by the ceiling displaying food and drink specials. Old arcade games (pac man!) are in the back. We were impressed by the warm and inviting vibe.

The cocktail list is imaginitive, with several house-made infused liquors, including blueberry bourbon. There were about 5 beers on tap. The Maine Beer Company Mo and an Otter Creek were somewhat rare on draft. We both started with homemade pumpkin spiced sangria. They arrived in pint glasses and were absolutely refreshing and delicious.

We shared the quaesadilla of the day as an appetizer, which featured brisket and bbq sauce. 3 giant pieces of bbq perfection arrived a few minutes later and we devoured. The menu is split into sandwiches, flatbreads and bbq combo platters. The appetizer was such a tease that K and I both ordered the brisket sandwich. I added a side of mac and cheese while she stuck with the chips. The sandwiches arrived overflowing with meat and stacked with cooked onions on a large roll. The meat didn't have any sauce on it, so I slathered one of the two house made sauces. I had recently traveled to Charlotte and tried the brisket at the much acclaimed Mac's BBQ, but I prefer Elsmere's. It was less dry, tastier, and maybe the expectations were a tad lower. The yelp reviews had me wary for the mac and cheese but I thought it was delicious, and about as good as I've seen for a $3 side.

The atmosphere was charming, the food was very, very good and the bartender was friendly and attentive. I'd highly recommend Elsmere and can't wait to go back. The burnt ends Chili and pulled pork flatbread looked amazing. In the meantime I suppose it's time to give Salvage another try..."
2967,"Rich tender meats: brisket,pork and ribs were all sampled on this visit. Balanced by well prepared sides:tangy coleslaw, creamy mac and cheese, and cornbread were sampled. Cocktails were well crafted, and remain a better value than on the other side of the Million dollar bridge.

What made this visit different than my first three months ago? It's that  this BBQ joint has found its groove. Clear signage eliminates the uncertainty of parking.
Along the same line there is now one entrance,staffed at all times with a hostess to direct traffic.Service was spot on and friendly and everything on the menu was available

Officially my favorite BBQ in the Portland area and a wonderful addition to the neighborhood."
2968,"My husband and I don't typically have Sunday's off and we BOTH did today. Long story short, we tried to get sandwiches at many different places that were closed Sunday's, decided on Elsmere (we've been wanting to check it out!). It wasn't busy, people were sitting outside. Sunday HAPPY HOUR 1-3 so our shipyard beers were only $3. The meal was awesome and our server was great! I can't wait to go back!"
2969,"I am a fan of the destination South Portland is becoming.  New businesses are popping up and making the ""trek"" over the bridge to the Old Port less and less necessary for a good dinner and night out. 
While Elsmere is not new this year, I didn't make it in until the past few months after having it on my list of places to go.  Let's just say that as of tonight, I have already eaten here twice this week alone.
Parking is on the side and rear of the building and there is a business across the street that allows parking after hours as well as on street parking.  Do not park next door where the laundry is.
The atmosphere is relaxed and the smoke smell is not overpowering.  They have a few booths, seats at the bar (I don't love the seats and lack of foot rails), seats at the ""food bar"" with a nice view of Momma (the smoker) as well as tables inside and porch tables on the patio.
The brisket is the most popular item and if they are going to sell out of something, it will be the brisket.  The pulled pork and chicken are as also really good.  I have not had the wings but two friends had them and loved them.  The oysters are delicious!  The smoked sausage link with mustard bbq sauce is a regular for me.  My most fav on the menu is the tornado sandwich, three meats, pickled onions and coleslaw on a pretzel bun with a side of chips... I order some beans and add them on to it and use a fork and knife since this is a sloppy delightful mess.
They have local brews on tap, Allagash, Banded Horn, etc. as well as bottled beers like Stella.  They have a full bar and some house drinks like the Elsmere Lemonade.
The staff is friendly and they have nonprofit nights (which I just took advantage of on 5.5.15 for my Diabetes cycling team).  Whiskey Wednesdays!"
2970,Great food! And great drinks! Saw the review and decide to stop by. It gets very crowded so expect that and parking can be a little tricky. Overall experience was fantastic! Our pregnant bartender was the sweetest. Making sure we were well taken care of. I would deff come back again to try the ribs since it ran out while I was here.
2971,"Our waitress was very nice, attentive, personable, timely. It is a fun setting with a mid to upper noise level. It is authentic BBQ, unlike chain ""BBQ"". The corn bread has actual corn kernels , not my liking but u might. The cold slaw is more vinegary than we like but again u may like it that way. I do not use these to effect my review. However, the brisket was dry, the ribs were over cooked and fall off the bone. The pulled pork was OK. The brownie ice cream was great and enough for two. They have a few more items I would like to try, I am hoping that this was a fluke and that someone just screwed up and left them under the lamp."
2972,"Had a fantastic post-movie dinner here with family. We four all have various dietary needs (including pescatarian) and everyone was happy with the options and their selection. I think this quality stands out in a BBQ spot.

Cal-Mex shrimp tacos were tasty and authentic (corn tortillas, cabbage). I ordered them mostly because our waitress said they were so popular that she was the only server offering them that evening. I believe they are being added to the regular menu. My companions had the Tornado burrito, salmon sandwich, and burger. All were pleased. Our server was remarkably efficient and detail-oriented (picking up on a nearly-empty drink from across the room, for example). And whether that shrimp taco pitch was true or not, she sold me on it and I give her two thumbs up from an entrepreneurial standpoint.

Also tried the blood orange Old Fashioned. Delicious little apéritif but I would not order 2 in one visit.

Something unique here which I think is brilliant: in the difficult, unclaimed territory between hostess, open kitchen, bar, and dining room they've installed a bar island so you can stand, wait for your table, and have a drink. Being comfortable during a wait can make all the difference (looking your way, Hot Suppa).

Next time, going in for some goods from Mama, their Texas-built BBQ. I hope the ambiance/character grows over time. Right now it is hard to pin down a vibe but perhaps I need to increase my familiarity with the South Portland crowd."
2973,"We can't get enough of this place. The food is always far above exceptional, we joke that they always seem to be over staffed, which is nice for the customers! 5 or so waitresses for 10 or so tables? The waitresses all have great personalities, and every employee seems happy to be there. Oh and the food, yeah it's bomb."
2974,"What do you want when you are visiting Maine for one night? Lobster - no. Non-crustacean seafood - of course not. You want barbecue! Once you realize that,  you should definitely hit Elsmere. Great atmosphere although not super quiet. Friendly,  efficient wait staff. Genuinely exceptional meat. Yummy. 


Go!"
2975,"Finally made it in to Elsmere BBQ Friday night. It was jam packed full, inside and out. Quite loud even that crowded. Found a seat luckily at the bar, quick friendly service. Though small uncomfortable bar stools. Started with couple grilled oysters, pretty good. Had the special...BBQ Turkey Quesadilla, and a Banded Horn IPA. All in all a solid meal, will have to try the straight out BBQ at some point. Will update review when I do."
2976,"Came in for a beer and a sandwich at the bar on a fairly slow Wednesday night. Got the beer and a menu just fine, but I've been waiting 25 minutes and counting for the bartender to stop chatting with friends and come take my order.

Not the first time the service has been slow here either. Waited an hour in a party of 4 last time, get seated, put an order in and then 40 minutes later the waitress comes back to say they've run out of 2 entree items... WTF..?!?

But no worries, the other 2 orders will be up soon, so at least half the party gets to eat. 

And at $11-12 per sandwich, the prices aren't great either.

Frankly, there are better BBQ options in Portland, although it would be a struggle to find  a local restaurant that treats you worse, so if you like being ignored and starved, maybe this is the place for you!"
2977,"I understand that tastes in food are subjective. However, once you start writing a few reviews, whether on Yelp, or somewhere else (like your own blog), then you need to take a step and try to move it past mere personal tastes.

When it comes to BBQ in Maine (or if you prefer, Barbeque) is one food category that is really lacking. I continue to be amazed when I read reviews about BBQ, in that reviewers gush about places that I try, and then think, ""what""?

Of greater-Portland's two newest BBQ joints, my wife and I hit Salvage first. I reviewed it and you'll see we both liked it, with a caveat, or two.

Elsmere was a disappointment. Even with Salvage opening, knowing there was a BBQ joint in SoPo (a place I love for a variety of reasons) was intriguing. For one thing, even though I don't expect it to rival it's foodie sister across the bridge, a few more decent restaurants wouldn't be a bad thing.

The space occupied by Elsmere is great; located in the old Colonial Cleaners at the corner of Elsmere and Cottage Road, the size and set-up works. Not too big, but with enough tables, a good-sized bar, and some outdoor seating, even when busy, the wait isn't interminable.

The food (which is why we decided to visit) was disappointing. I say this because I wanted to be wowed. Having read reviews prior, however, I was a bit anxious about trying another BBQ place, only to be let down.

While the meat had a nice smoked flavor, my wife's ribs were not the fall-off-the-bone tender that we expect in a restaurant touting its BBQ. The ribs also seemed to be lacking much meat. My brisket was decent, had some decent barking, and I was satisfied. In both cases--the ribs and the brisket--I thought the amounts of meat were skimpy, at least in comparison to other rib places I've frequented.

We both liked the mustard sauce. The ""red"" sauce, which I think the waitress said was a Texas-based sauce, with a peppery kick was just okay.

The sides were so-so. We both tried the vinegar-dressed cole slaw. The mix of cabbage and pepper was flavorful, but the chop was too fine for our preference. The vinegar-based dressing was ok, but lacked any ""wow"" factor, and was even ""too vinegary"" making me wonder if they just tossed vinegar over the chopped ingredients and added some pepper.

The cornbread was dry and came wrapped in tinfoil, so I'm assuming it was supposed to be warm--it wasn't. No butter was supplied, either.

I had the baked beans, my wife went with mac and cheese. The beans were tasty, with a ketchup-based (?) sauce that was flavorful. The pinto beans were just the right texture, and this was the best of the sides. The mac and cheese required salting, which meant that it wasn't as flavorful as it should have been out of the oven.

The service really was a downer. We were out on the patio and felt like we might have been forgotten, even though there were other diners out there with us. Our server was slow taking our order. Then, when our food finally arrived, we lacked silverware. While I'm not anti-fingers and hands in eating my BBQ, cole slaw and sides like beans require a fork, at a minimum.

Since the food was cooling and no waitress was around, my wife went inside and mentioned to the waitress that we lacked forks and knives. The waitress continued talking to her colleague, so my wife grabbed silverware from an empty table so we could eat.

When our waitress checked back with us we were nearly finished. No ""I'm sorry about the silverware,"" or making sure our meals were okay. I had a beer at the beginning, prior to receiving our meals. I'd at least have liked being asked before she brought the check. I usually don't want a beer when I'm getting ready to leave. 

I think I could have given Elsmere a three for the food, barely. However, for food that was so-so, with lousy service, I can't give it more than a two-star review.

It's obvious that the owners are trying and have invested in the space. They need to get some things ironed out, however, if you want me to sing your praises.

I probably won't be back to give it a second shot."
2978,"Tried the Elsmere today for the Barbeque experience but we have one issue..... we love all Barbeque so our perspective isn't as a Barbeque pro.
We eat Barbeque everywhere we go. Northern Maine on the side of he road to the Carolinas and Georgia pit masters. Cheap chains with Porky signs lure us off the road easily but today was a true BBQ taste experience. We started with the Burnt ends nachos which were on the small side but the burnt ends chili was great. A scoop of Guacamole  and chopped tomatoes would have been a crowning moment but so it goes. The chili more than diminished the thought as we finished it.
Next was the Mama's plates of brisket and ribs. Every bite of the brisket was juicy with an amazing taste of smoked meat but with a hint that the meat in its raw state was worthy of the pit. The St. Louis style ribs were amazing too. Fall off the bone moist again with great flavor. We were schooled in great BBQ today in the last area of the country we thought we would be.
We will return!"
2979,"Great meal at Elsmere's on my last night in Portland (visiting from Michigan). Great food, and the staff was friendly...plus my table got a peak into the smoker after dinner- super cool! 

Loved the spicy BBQ sauce and the black pepper bbq sauce (especially mixed!). Didn't love the baked beans, but the brisket, Mac n cheese, and cornbread were excellent. Wishing I could go back! Definitely have to come back if I'm ever in Portland again."
2980,"This place is charming as hell.  The food is good, but when I came I REALLY wanted some french fries and guess what?  They DO NOT have them, or a fryer....  Which ok, yes it is healthier, but seriously, this is a BBQ place!   UGGGG

Speaking of food, the menu is very limited, but the drinks are great and the way they serve them is fun.

Not sure I will be back, but it was a fun experience and the service was pretty, friendly, and efficient!"
2981,"I don't eat meat and I liked this place. I went there for Sunday lunch with my husband and son. They have a good selection of beers and cocktails. I ordered a Bloody Mary and my husband got an allagash white. The Bloody Mary was flavorful but I like them to have a lot of stuff in them and all it came with was an olive, a lime slice, and a lemon slice. It would have been better with some celery, pickled green beans, and a carrot. Something more. 
Now for the food. I ordered a black bean burger with pickled cherry peppers and pepper jack cheese. So delicious. I love a good veggie burger! My husband ordered some sort of meat combo plate with sausage and ribs. It came with cornbread and two side dishes. He seemed to enjoy everything because there was very little left. They have two BBQ sauces on the table. I hate BBQ sauce. Next to mayonnaise, it's my least favorite condiment. So I was hesitant when my husband told me to try the mustard BBQ sauce. I tried a tiny squeeze on the greens on my burger. It was so delicious! Tasted like a sweet and tangy honey mustard and I ended up dressing my greens with it. Yum! 
The service was fine. Our server was pleasant and friendly. The food came out quickly and she checked in with us several times to see how we were doing. 
I've read the other reviews and I don't think this place deserves three stars, that's a little harsh yelpers. One thing that I've noticed about portland is that everyone seems to be looking for a deal. It's slightly annoying. ""Specials"" at a restaurant generally mean that they have an abundance of a product that they are looking to get rid of. That's not what I look for at a restaurant. I also don't complain about the cost of drinks. If you want to drink on the cheap, drink at home or hit up a dive bar. This is a business that will only stay in business by making money. They contribute to the economy so don't cheap out and get upset by a $5 beer, it's pathetic. 
Overall a good experience and we will be back. It's got a good vibe, cool decor, and solid food."
2982,"Very slow service tonight with very overcooked nachos. I will give positive kudos for their flat bread pizza they had on the specials menu. Otherwise, not a great night!  Not sure I would venture out that way again any time soon."
2983,"The food was good, but it just wasn't exceptional in any way. I was so hoping for more, and I may be wiling to give it another shot. I did like my catfish meal, but again it was pretty ordinary. My husband had a mixed meats plate, and the sausage stood out as the star. 

The service was friendly but slow. We waited ten minutes to order drinks, then another 15 before she took our food order, so it was a good 25 minutes before we ordered. 

The patio was a nice option on a warm summer evening. Sadly the chairs were very uncomfortable, and the small patio tables were really too small for more than two people (we were a group of 4). The large round trays the food was served on didn't fully fit on the table, so it felt like our food was spilling into our laps. We put the condiments on the ground to make more space for food and drinks."
2984,Had a Great meal at Ellesmere last night. We ate at the bar and the service was great. Thank you Angela. The food was also really good;  best ribs I've ever had there. They were perfect. Also had the barbecue chicken wings which are my favorite there. Great product. Really enjoyed our time.
2985,"I popped in here for a client meeting recently, and loved it. The atmosphere was fun and hip -- and busy for a Thursday evening! There's not a ton of parking, but it's worth it. We had a pulled pork pizza and it was delicious. One of the people in our party had some food allergies and the waitress was SO awesome about it -- she took her time explaining things, asked the owner/chefs a few questions for him, and was just as patient and friendly as can be. Awesome drink selections, too."
2986,"As a barbecue joint it is so-so...as a neighborhood hangout it's great. I desperately wanted to like this place and write a glowing review. The food smelled amazing and as I waited to dig in, I thought about all of the good things I was going to say in my Yelp review. Then we started eating and all of my gastronomic dreams were shattered.

The positives: Nice decor, full bar, good energy, local, and clean. We were on a mission for meat, so we didn't mess around with appetizers...they looked pretty good and I would go back to try an appetizer with some drinks. I grew up 100 yards down the street, so I'm happy to see another solid addition to the mix of neighborhood businesses.

The negatives: The barbecue. I spent 10 years in Kansas CIty, and know a thing or two about barbecue. The brisket was both fatty and dry at the same time...which is a pretty impressive accomplishment. Yes, I know brisket is inherently fatty, but most places trim it a bit before serving. The chunks we got were 1/3 fat. Very unappealing. The pulled pork was especially disappointing. It was served wet in some sort of mystery flavor liquid. It wasn't smoky at all. It tasted like it had been braised in Campbell's chicken noodle soup broth. The sausage was pretty good. I'd definitely get it again.

Their per-pound prices for meat were cheaper than Salvage BBQ in Portland, but when one-third of that portion is fat, and what is edible is only so-so in flavor, the lower price isn't such a good deal."
2987,"Loved this place! We went to Elesmers for a late lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the very attentive staff, generous portions and savory BBQ.

 Party of two; salad with marinated chicken (the chicken was so tender and flavorful), pulled pork plate (rich in flavor and wonderfully seasoned). 

 Thanks, we will be back."
2988,"Great Pull Pork, Great Chicken, Ceaser Salad was good. Mac and Cheese Ive had much better. All in all the food was great. the place smelled great. The fiery and mustard bbq sauces were spicy and tangy. I sat at the bar by myself had a good meal Place was full and busy on a Wednesday. I would definitley go back to try the other sides. Mac n cheese was just OK but DONT LET THAT STOP YOU. Stop reading and go get some BBQ"
2989,"This place has me questioning if I even like BBQ. I came here because I thought I did.. but I left wondering if I'd managed to convince myself over the years that BBQ is something much different than what I just ate. 

First things first, we are locals and nearly drove right by the place because there wasn't a SINGLE light on outside. Even when we left at quarter 'til 9, it was pitch black. Thank you, smartphone, for illuminating the path to my car for me. I don't know what I would have done without you (probably tripped and fallen on my face, which would have culminated in the perfect ending to this night out).  

Our service was only okay. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't horrible either. Just a little slow and inattentive (flagging someone down for a refill is never fun). There wasn't any explanation of the sauces, no specials shared, and very little interaction considering the new-ness of the place. (Come on guys, SELL me on coming back!) 

As we were waiting for our food, we noticed that the entire place is covered in unfinished wood, with some pieces in the process of transforming into a dark red finish. It made me wonder about ventilation while they're staining. (We just finished staining our closet and let me tell you--it stinks for days.) 

There is a nice bar area against the kitchen so you can see food being made, which I thought was a little different and fun. We were seated at a 2-top that was abnormally long, so I felt like I was screaming over the noise to talk. It would be nice if they added something to the ceiling to lessen the echo bouncing around, but obviously it's a new business, and they still have a few building improvements to make. I will say that sitting against a window, we could not feel any cool air coming from outside, which made me very happy as I was expecting to have to wear my coat through the meal like I end up doing at older Portland restaurants.

Now for the food... I didn't overly enjoy a single piece of my meal here. Well, I take that back---I DID enjoy the dry corn bread, but only because it cleansed my palate. I can't even describe what was wrong; the sauce seemed extremely sweet with a weird tangy aftertaste. The sausage itself was good with a spicy kick, but it just wasn't enough. My husband said his pulled pork tasted dry and unseasoned, and certainly not like it had been marinating for a few hours, let alone days.  

This place is more along the lines of 2.5 stars, but since Yelp doesn't allow half-stars, I had to go with my gut. Giving it a 3 would mean that we'd potentially come back, but it's not very likely we'll spend money here again, so I had to give it a 2. 

Sorry Elsmere's.. I wanted to like you."
2990,"We went here tonight on our first visit to South Portland.

We ordered ribs and brisket. The ribs were the worst I have ever had anywhere, and I've eaten a lot of ribs in some dive places. There was absolutely NO meat on them. I was scraping the skin off with my teeth. As someone who has worked in the industry, I'm perplexed that any restaurant would serve those ribs. They were AWFUL. Maybe one bite of meat on them total. And the one bite had no flavor. There was nothing fall off the bone about those.

The brisket was better, but lacked sauce. The bbq on the table is good so used that to add some flavor. The sides, mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread were just plain bland. No flavor in any of it. The kids ate burgers, which were really good. Love their potato chips.

We might go back for a burger, but I can't say we'd return for the bbq. I've had way better all around."
2991,"A good BBQ meal but nothing you haven't had before. The food was well prepared and tasty, but ultimately uninspired. I had the pulled chicken and sausage and enjoyed both. The sausage in particular was very good. My dining companion had the catfish, which was tasty and perfectly prepared. Really good coleslaw, their recipe is nice and vinegary instead of the gloppy mayonnaise nightmare you often get. They offered two sauces, their house sauce and a black pepper sauce. The house sauce was very good, but we found their black pepper sauce to be rather unpleasant, essentially the equivalent of a mouthful of black pepper with no other discernible flavor. The wait staff was very friendly and the service was great. 

My biggest complaint was the way the food was served. They serve your meal on a huge platter with all the component in little paper boats. With 4 people at our patio table, we had difficulty fitting all the food on the table. The oversized platters were far bigger than was required to serve the amount of food placed on them. Overall a good meal, but not distinctive in the world of BBQ. Although with the dearth of decent dining in SoPo, this is a nice addition. I did think it a bit pricey for the portion size however. With the growing selection of really good BBQ places in Southern Maine, they need to step it up in the creativity department if they want to hold their own."
2992,"Having experienced great BBQ all over the country,  I really was not expecting more than an adequate meal. The BBQ @Ellsmere BBQ and Wood Grill, was some of the best that I have ever had. The collard greens were definitely the best.

Like most BBQ restaurants, the atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable.  The service is unbeatable even for a busy Saturday evening.

I highly recommend this restaurant."
2993,"The best compliment that I can give to Elsmere is ""Meh."" It is simply okay. We've eaten here a few times and I've never had a meal that has blown me away. Sure, the service is good and the beer selection rocks, but the food is just... okay. I would say they are a step up from Salvage, but they are quite a few steps below Beale Street."
2994,"Incredible food and top notch wait staff !  Perfect neighborhood, family friendly Restaurant.  Mahi Mahi tacos are a favorite as is the ever changing flatbread.  Some evenings we just go for the slow smoke wings !"
2995,"Starting with the positives:
Upon entrance one first notices the relaxed family atmosphere; Even those at the bar were relaxed while enjoying the soccer game. 
The seats are huge and can accommodate large parties/families which is nice. 

Now for critique:
After ordering, the food comes out fast, too fast, and this patron was surprised that with such quick service that the medium rare burger ordered came out well done. A well done burger holds little flavor and is a disappointment to get when not ordered."
2996,"I was very impressed with Elsmere BBQ and Wood Grill!

We had the grilled garlic butter oysters, which were by far the highlight of the meal! My wife and I also tried the brisket, smoked sausage, mac-n-cheese and collard greens.  The sides were amazing! The mac-n-cheese was very creamy and sharp and the collard greens had a lot of bursting, savory flavor.  The bbq was also very good!  

I took away a star becuase they do not have potato salad, the cole slaw is acidic and they do not have french fries.  

I will defiantly be back very soon."
2997,"Great place for bbq!! Good, strong drinks...better than average BBQ and a fun/quirky environment. Food is a bit pricey for those watching their pennies, and overall Moe's BBQ blows this place out of the water."
2998,"I'm giving this 2 stars, but would like reader to bear in mind that it was their un-official opening and there are still a few kinks that need to be worked out with the menu.  I do think it has potential...I'll definitely go back again for a second try, but as of right now, there's a lot of room to grow.

Went here with a group of friends - we were very excited to have a new BBQ place around the area.  The space is great, lots of tables.  The service, for its first night, did a pretty good job -  they were accommodating, worked well under pressure.  The drinks were great - the Elsmere lemonade was awesome, tasting like summer in glass. 

As for the meats:
- the smoked wings were decent, would have liked a smokier flavor
- the pulled pork was okay
- the brisket was a little dry, but good (I used to live in Texas, so I have fairly high standards)
- the ribs were good, fall off the bone
- the sausage was actually the best of all the meats I tried - it had the smokiest flavor of them all

As for the sides:
- the mac and cheese was really creamy, but very tasty
- the BBQ beans, left a lot to be desired in terms of what I like in beans - they were too sweet for my liking.
- the cornbread was something to stay away from.  It has some weird off taste, almost sour to it.
- I wish I would've ordered the collard greens to try them out.

As for the sauces - well only 2 sauces.  Both of them were too sweet for me and I was kind of disappointed that they didn't have any spicier sauces."
2999,"My wife and I have been to Elsmere twice now.  Both times we left satisfied with the quality of the food and the value we received.  That is rare these days.

Unique atmosphere.  You can sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen, sit inside near or far from the TVs, or weather permitting eat outside on the patio.  There is parking out back and across the street after 5pm.

The BBQ is very good.  The best I've had?  No, but it is very good for Maine.  IMO better than Bucks.  Have not tried Salvage as yet.

Only a couple of sauces on the table and they are both good.  The sides are varied and the ones I've tried (beans, cornbread, mac & cheese) have been excellent.

A word about the service we've had - great!  We've had the same server twice, Lauren.  She's very friendly, attentive, and fun.  Elsmere should consider cloning her.  Lauren is a gem!

Well worth your money."
3000,"I would give this restaurant a second chance.  I was in a party of 3 and my two companions loved their dinners.  We started with pulled pork nachos (ordered at the bar as we had a ~20 minute wait).  For me, these were the highlight of the experience.  They were delicious and not over the top as some nachos are.  

While I agree with others that the St Louis ribs were not drenched in sauce, I found them less than appealing both for the limited meat on the ribs and how difficult they were to eat.  There was a choice of two rib sauces and the one I tried was okay.  (I had high expectations as this is a BBQ place, right?). I'm glad I only ordered the 1/2 lb as I didn't eat them.  The corn bread was good, beans were average and the coleslaw was too tangy for my taste.

Worth another try cause 2 of the 3 of us liked our dinners.  Service was average?"
3001,"Outstanding BBQ. Salvage BBQ has some real competition. I didn't like the beans (personal preference nothing they did). Brisket, ribs, and pulled pork were excellent"
3002,What a great atmosphere! My boyfriend and i traveled from new york to eat all around maine & weve been here 3 days & its our favorite place for sure! I had the pulled pork sandwich which was delicious & savory. My boyfriend bad the mahi tacos & they were mouthwatering! The drinks were perfectly blended! And the service was fast!! Parking could be better but other than that it was amazing!
3003,"I've had some BBQ here and there, and more recently Maine has had more BBQ places open and I've tried them all. Elsmere BBQ and Wood Grill is fantastic! The food is amazing, it's a great neighborhood place with a cool bar and more bar seating at the ""kitchen"". The only thing I'm not crazy about is the level of noise when the place is full. Maybe more or different decorating would help take care of the noise. 

The first time I went they had only been open a few days so I had some of the issues other people did, slow service, delays with drinks, etc. The next time I went my friend and I got great service and sat at the bar. It really is good food with good beer and it's a great neighborhood place. South Portland has really become a foodie town!"
3004,"OK. A random stop on the way back from the Portland head light house place was packed so that tells you something! There was about an hour wait so we grabbed a seat at the bar - welcomed by a handsome bartender - Jeff :). We ordered the elsmere lemonade Peach infused brandy with homemade lemonade yum 
Got the pulled pork plate with beans and Mac & cheese  .... the Mac and cheese had a smokey flavor that was delish. The pork was tender and I loved the mustard based BBQ sauce ...and well yes Jeff too!!"
3005,"Waitress was good. We tried the works, the bbq chicken was really good, very juicy and well seasoned. The ribs and brisket were a bit over cooked and bland. The sides were ok, some needed a bit more salt. Overall it was ok."
3006,"If you are planning a small event. This is the only place to be! From the view, to the staff and the food this place is a gem. When I first met with Charlie to plan the event, he made it so very easy and we sealed the deal with a handshake! My daughters shower was a big deal to me and everything was perfect. I am a former caterer, cooking school director and foodie so I know good food and this impressed us all on every level. The scallop sliders were all they could have been and the meatballs were real! Like your Italian grandma would make. The set up needs little decor as it is perfect in its simplicity. Every guest was impressed and made sure to compliment the food, the location and the staff. 
This place will make your day!
It is special
The staff could not be more professional and helpful.
Whitney is one of those people you wish could walk through life with you... so you do t miss anything along the way. She too made it effortless. I wish I had to plan another event...
It would be there!
Do yourself a favor. Book this place if available. Period."
3007,"I was so un impressed that I'm still sitting in the restaurant waiting to pay. I just couldn't let the clear thoughts of dissatisfaction dissipate through the sands of time. Upon arrival, my friend and I seemed hopeful for the quality of food based on its menu and physical appearance of the location. We were severely disappointed when we got our food. Nothing tasted fresh and seemed to have been thawed and thrown on a plate. The quality of food does match the set price points.

Over it.

Just now as we're leaving my friend says: ""let's go, I wanna go home to eat!"" After eating here."
3008,"Being a Falmouth resident, I'm a big fan of Dockside. This is a great brunch / happy hour joint. The view is beautiful and the food always good. When it's a little warmer you can sit on the deck outdoors and enjoy a cocktail while staring at the beautiful harbor. 

Yesterday I went for brunch which is always a home run. They have music every Sunday and they make SPECIAL donuts every Sunday (always different flavors). This past Sunday they had: Maple Bacon glaze, chocolate frosted sprinkle and lemon ganache! Always 3 to an order and our table of 5 split them up. They also offer breakfast items plus lunch items for their brunch. I had the curry chicken salad and it was SO good! It comes on top of a bed of lettuce. 

Also their grand marnier mimosa is so good! The peach bellini is also a favorite. 

Make a little trip out here for brunch this spring, you'll thank me! See their happy hour specials too 4-6 Tues - Sun."
3009,"Do not believe the web site.   They do not cater to large groups or children.   Our dinner took 3 hours.   The service was terrible.  The manager and servers were rude.   Tables that came in after us were finished eating before we were served.   When I inquired about this I was told because we were a large group they held our order for last.   This was not communicated to us.   Meanwhile we were at 4 separate tables with separate checks.   When I mentioned that the website says they cater to large groups I was told that they aren't responsible for what the website says.    

When we finally received they check they added 20% gratuity    We we're not told about this in advance and the service did not warrant this tip.   I could continue about the rude and terrible service.  Just avoid at all costs."
3010,"I only give this a 2 star due to the service, just terrible and slow. View was great, food was good and location is fantastic. 
Unfortunately we had to remind our server at least 3-4 times for simple items, long waits on drinks or refreshing our water on a very hot day yesterday. She apologized yet back in my college days I waited tables so basic service isn't hard.  
We got there around 1:45 and at the time it was maybe a 1/4 full so it wasn't a capacity issues. 
Again, she could have been new. Would I go back, maybe but would move if we got the same server."
3011,"The most apparent strength of this restaurant is the view- the harbor looks incredible at any time of day. My options were limited, as I was at an event, but the scallops, which came with couscous and broccoli, were excellent. My friends ordered the lobster which was equally delicious. Our server, Annabelle, was super attentive both during the dinner and the reception that followed. I definitely recommend stopping by!"
3012,"My party of 7 made a reservation for 8pm. We arrived 10 mins early and the restaurant couldn't accommodate us at the time. They politely asked us to wait while they set up our table. We waited for 15 mins for it to be ready. 
The view is really nice. The service was really horrible. They server immediately took our order which was nice. We were hungry and couldn't wait to eat. About 10 mins after we placed the order, we were told they ran out of rib eye (which 4 people ordered). They chose short ribs instead. It took 50 mins for us to get bread and it was burnt on the bottom. The restaurant was now near empty aside from a couple of people at the bar and a few people still eating. After about an hour and 15 mins from the time we placed our final order, we were given our food. I was told the short ribs were really good and tender, everyone else's meal was ok. Our server was pretty good with refilling our drinks. 
By the time we were done eating, they were cleaning up. The staff began to act as if the restaurant was completely empty with how loud they were talking and sharing stories. 
I would not visit this place again. The view was nice, the food was ok but pricey, the staff was polite but no way would I go back to a place that has you sit there for over an hour without any updates."
3013,"While staying in South Portland on business, I wanted to avoid summer tourists, yet get a reasonably priced lobster dinner.  This place hit the spot!  A single lobster with 2 sides was under $20! (Tax included and they don't take tips).  While it is no frills, no alcohol and self service, you can BYOB!  In fact, if you ask for beer or wine they suggest, if you haven't brought your own cooler, you can go to the convenience store next door and get what you need.  They will even supply cups and bottle openers! Thumbs up!!!"
3014,"My wife and I drove around the area looking for a simple lobster roll and French fries.  We were just in the mood.  Being from New England we are quite familiar with the price range for this simple meal.  
Even their lobster roll was good and the French fries were decent and their Diet Coke was cold - it wasn't as good as their price reflected.  For 2 lobster rolls, FF and diet cokes - we rang out at $48.60.  That's the most money I've ever paid for lobster roll and FF....I get it we paid for the view.  
I really made a choice to attempt to REALLY REALLY enjoy the lobster for the price I paid.  

FYI - it wasn't on their menu - we had to ask for it."
3015,"Got 3 hours to kill and don't care what you eat or how much it costs?  Then Dockside is for you!

The 2 stars are to be distributed as follows: the bartenders and wait staff get one--they are superb and long-suffering.  The pumpkin beer served with a cinnamon-sugar rim was quite enjoyable. The other star is for the view, which is great until the sun goes down.  Then it is dark.

I didn't order the salmon because I was assured it was previously frozen.  I didn't ask about the haddock and probably should have because it was tasteless and slightly dry.  The risotto on which it sat was not too bad, and the asparagus was good too.

Sitting around for 3 hours with a brief period of scarfing fish would have been reasonably pleasant except that it was surprisingly noisy--I had to really lean in to hear the person across from me.  I can only assume the kitchen is too small or short-handed to deal with a full restaurant.  

One more remark: they don't take reservations, and the hostess was struggling to keep a good attitude about finding room for a large party.  A top restaurant does not make the diners feel like they are asking too much to sit and eat their food."
3016,"We had our sisters bridal shower in the upstairs room.  I emailed a bunch with Charlie who was very informative.  Day of was so smooth. We had Whitney and Sydney in charge of our event.  They set the room anyway we wanted and were continually asking if there was anything we needed.  Whitney brought out drinks when everyone arrived. The food was delicious... everyone was raving about it. There was not a charge for the room... just a food/beverage minimum, which was not hard to meet with 40 people there. Id do it again in heartbeat! Thanks to dockside and especially whitney and sydney."
3017,"This was a great find for lunch on a lovely Sept. Day. View was amazing, right on the water. Place was busy but service pretty good and a very friendly and attentive server. Food was also very fresh and tasty. I would definitely recommend it."
3018,"Had lunch at the Dockside Grill today.The view is phenomenal! Ok where is this going when you begin with talking about the view and not the food? (And it really is a fabulous vista)
I had the fish tacos which were in need of a major flavor infusion and way more fish!!!
My friend had the strawberry salad which our server graciously substituted a cheese other than what was on the menu. My friend included shrimp and she said it was tasty.
The servers were friendly, attentive and happy the weather was clearing early this afternoon!"
3019,"This is the first time I've ever had to return a meal in a restaurant that was completely un-edible.  I ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer, I was absolutely starving and ate what I could but it was oversalted to the point where I had to stop. My steak, risotto, and grilled asparagus arrived shortly after. The herb butter was overpowering, same for the risotto, and again everything was heavily salted. Every bite got worse.The waitress could not have been nicer, and she had the manager come over. They ended up comping my dinner, and I took a dessert to go, and even that was horrible. I had to throw it out after a couple of bites. It's a beautiful location it's a shame that the kitchen does not match.  Friday night, payday, was looking to go out and have a delicious hassle free meal. Did not meet my expectations. I am a resident of Falmouth, I will not return."
3020,"A friend of ours recommended Dockside Grill to take family when they were visiting Maine. We checked out their website, Facebook, Yelp and OpenTable reviews. Based on pictures and reviews it looked like a great place to try.  We had a party of 9 so I made a reservation several days in advance and they were able to accommodate us. The area they sat us in didn't look anything like the pictures that were online. We were right next to the bar and the noise level was unbearable. We all tried to make the best of it but when the waitress came to take our drink orders we told her we had to leave. It was more of a bar atmosphere than a relaxing dinner by the water. Very disappointed!! We will not go back."
3021,"Great ambiance and mouthwatering food, near the dock with amazing views of the water. Perfect for brunch/lunch"
3022,"Great atmosphere.  Good drinks.  Food not as good as the prices would suggest.  In fact, on more recent visits the food has been disappointing.  

We live close by and would go often, but it is priced more for expense report or special occasion meals."
3023,"Ok, 5 stars may be strong. I took my sister out for her birthday. We didn't feel like driving into town so the Foreside location was convenient. Quite frankly we were hoping for decent. We got exceptional. I had tuna and my sister had scallops. We both felt the dinners were the best we had in some time. I hope they can keep it up. Looking forward to going back."
3024,"This has been the summer of trying new things for me and I'm so happy that my friend suggested trying Dockside Grill. As all the other reviewers have the said, the views of the harbor and ocean are spectacular. My friend and I sat at the apex of the large horseshoe-shaped bar that juts out onto the deck and it was the perfect spot for happy hour drinks and a light dinner. 

Drinks & Food: we both started with a glass of the happy hour special cava and then my friend moved to a lovely blueberry lemonade cocktail that was light and refreshing. i had a salad with a very generous portion of salmon on top (not on the menu during dinner but my server/bartender made an exception) and my friend had tuna over risotto (I think) that was also delicious. 

Ambience: Incredible. I spied a fire pit with seating all around on the deck and I'm hoping to come back on a chilly evening and test it out. 

Service: our server/bartender was solid and the hostesses were lovely. 

I loved my experience at Dockside and I was thrilled at the proximity to Portland and the charming drive through Falmouth. Cheers to trying new places and having great experiences!"
3025,"Chilly?  No problem, let me get you a blanket! Hungry? No problem, let me fill your tummy with deliciousness. Thirsty? Ohhh, I got this, here are many drink choices to pick from! 4-6? Oh welcome to happy hour where you can have a yummy glass of wine for $4 and mouth water spanakopita.  What am I get at here?  Always, and I do mean always says yes to Dockside.  It's beautiful, you can sit inside or outside, the staff is beyond friendly and food is exceptional."
3026,"I came here for a family gathering and did not realize how beautiful the view is at this location. For anyone looking for a peaceful atmosphere, there are outdoor fireplaces overlooking the water. I absolutely cannot wait to go back here.

The food was lovely, well prepared and worth the money. I ordered the haddock (perfectly cooked) with grilled vegetables and a Caesar salad...which was part of the menu where you could pick your own sides (highly recommended). 

The service was attentive but seemed a bit annoyed with our questions and adding an extra person to our (big enough) table. In addition to this, the drinks from their cocktail menu tasted like juice and very sugary which is why I'm giving this establishment four stars. The food and atmosphere is my reason for returning."
3027,"This was our second time here.  I honestly would give this place 5 stars for food and atmosphere, but unfortunately the service was terrible. We are very easy going and I rarely write bad reviews about service as I know everyone is entitled to have a bad night, but our waitress didn't introduce herself, never checked up on us. Drinks were empty half the time and for a long time.  Handed us the bill and just said thanks. She wasnt rude, but could care less about us. Wouldn't mind at a busy pub or tavern. When you are spending 1-2 hundred on dinner, you should get exceptional service.  

On the other hand, the yellowfin tuna was delicious and perfectly cooked, and my wife loved her scallops. We had a wonderful evening, but the service and lack of attention turned us off."
3028,"Stunning location and good food.  Haddock was excellent (though the halibut looked better!), ice burg salad was very good, halibut ceviche was fresh and cleansing . Good selection of drinks. Highly recommended if you're passing this way."
3029,"Stopped in for a happy hour drink, and boy, is that view amazing! Our service was exceptional and the app we shared was amazing. Highly recommended!"
3030,Awesome view. Yummy drinks. Friendly staff. Good food. Love the chicken salad. Music on sundays for brunch.
3031,I go here a few times during summer each year and they are always accommodating with. Nice view and must go during summer evenings. Unwind by the fire pit with a sangria. Try the donuts during brunch.
3032,"I visited Dockside with 10 coworkers on a beautiful Monday evening. It was easy to find after veering onto route 88 in Falmouth, but the parking situation is confusing. Fortunately they had an attendant pointing the way.

Located steps from the ocean with a panoramic view, the setting is breathtaking. The Old Port is great, but the ocean view from the restaurants disappoint. Dockside's view is far better and would be a great choice for out of town guests.

There's a downstairs bar and seating, outdoor seating, and an upstairs dining room. We sat outside downstairs. The fried calamari was good, but normal. It was similar to any other seafood restaurant. The mussels were the big disappointment of the night. They were tiny, maybe the size of a nickel, with minimal flavor. After the appetizers I didn't know what to expect.

But the scallop dish was fantastic. 3 giant scallops (maybe too few for the nearly $30 price) were seared to perfection. As a fan of spicy foods, the giant poblano pepper holding a bed of rice was smoking hot. Too spicy for my co worker, but perfect for me. I'd order it again in a second.

Everyones' entree looked great. Huge portions of salmon, tilapia, tuna, all served with creative and fun sides.

For very solid seafood with a better view than Portland can provide, Dockside is a top pick."
3033,"Great views from the downstairs deck. I started with a white sangria. Very light drink. After that I needed something a bit stronger. Absolute Cosmo. Dinner was grilled scallops over mushroom risotto with brocolinni as a side. Scallops were cooked perfectly, risotto was not. It's hard to make risotto and unless it's done right it ends up a clumpy mess. The broccolini was great. Service was attentive and the place was hopping!"
3034,"My wife and I decided to try something new for Valentine's Day. I love and hate trying something new without a recommendation. But here we go. 
I felt I was in trouble when the place had terrible signage. In a door, up 23 flights of stairs. Missed the entrance, back down and followed the noise. We found it. They advertised live entertainment, but there was. Toning but jazz over the radio.

The host was the most unfriendly guy you have ever met Working in a restaurant. It felt we were bothering him. Finally seated near a window (no views, it was a cold winter evening) and the wind was blowing right through the glass. Glad I had a sweater. Ww were seated in what I can only call a bar area. With 2 TV's showing college basketball. Not very romantic, even though I ignored the games.

My wife ordered the sal on, good she said and I had scallops, overdone with a strange crispy outer. That was served over a sticky, mushy risotto. We shared calamari for an appetizer, greasy and the batter was too thick. We didn't even bother with desert. 

Overall, obviously not a positive experience. No chef here, maybe a borderline cook. And going to a restaurant is so much. Ore than just the food. And this place struck out across the board. Oh well, hope our next different place we try is a home run."
3035,"Not a great experience!  Ambiance is great but the food missed the mark.  Had a Rib Eye, came out very raw.  For the price we weren't impressed!"
3036,"Went here on a wednesday evening for happy hour. This was a fun happy hour spot. The service was good and the staff were friendly. We sat downstairs inside the patioThe dinner prices are bit expensive but apps and drinks for happy hour are reasonable. We tried the pulled pork nachos, which were suprisingly large portions with well seasoned pork. The fried calamari was good, not too greasy or too chewy. It was served with a nice creamy sauce with a bit of spice. The chicken flatbread was ok. The toppings weren't something I would normally pick and the crust was a tad overcooked. There are beers for $3, wine for $5 and cocktails for $6. I tried the rose on special. It was a nice dry finish but lacked any depth in flavor. I tried the lavendar lemonade, which is made only in the summer by the maine mead company. It was sweet yet citrusy and I just wanted to drink a whole bottle."
3037,"One of the worst experiences I've had with a restaurant.  Because the doors going out to the deck were open, the restaurant was extremely cold.  Finally after several patrons complained about how cold they were the doors were closed.  Unfortunately with the doors closed I was forced to fight off the flies while eating the very tough medium rare filet that I had ordered but came out as very well done. To top it all off, a fly landed in my drink. This is one patron that will not return to Dockside Grill."
3038,"The view from the deck is spectacular. We went here for brunch on a clear sunny day so the atmosphere was great! Our table ordered fresh made doughnuts as an appetizer (blueberry glazed, lemon glaze, cinnamon sugar) and they were warm and pretty good.  My husband ordered the house made hash and he just about licked the plate it was so good. The other three in our party myself included were generally satisfied with our meals. The dockside breakfast which it turns out is just your basic breakfast is a bit pricey for what you get..eggs, a few potatoes, meat, and toast. It seems it's better to go for the fancier options as they seem more aligned with the price..just be careful of substitutions as we didn't find out until we got our bill that substitutions (i.e. Bacon for fruit salad or bread/potatoes for green salad will cost you the full price of the menu item plus the full price of the substitutions. In general though this is a good spot and we will be back!"
3039,"My wife and I haven't been to the Dockside Grill since it opened (it was formerly the Falmouth Sea Grill); the restaurant is newly renovated, the service was outstanding, and the food was excellent. 

We had steaks, salads and a couple sides, and it was all perfectly-cooked and well-presented. Much less noisy and crowded than steakhouses in downtown Portland, we had a wonderful dinner. 

I HIGHLY recommend dining at this restaurant if you want a delicious meal and a refined dining experience."
3040,"A great place to eat, awesome food and easily the best view of any restaurant around. Try the seared tuna, you won't be sorry!

Dockside hosted our wedding reception in July, in their upstairs dining room. The menu items were planned well ahead of time, and EVERYTHING was perfect. Danica was a pleasure to deal with: professional, upbeat, accommodating and so much more. Our entire wedding party arrived at Handy Boat Works by boat, and Danica helped to make that happen. The appetizers were the best ever (try the scallop sliders) and our guests raved about the main course as well. The wait-staff and bar tenders were friendly and top notch!

We can't say enough good things about our great experience at Dockside. Whether it's a for quick dinner out or a special event, make it Dockside. And ask for Danica!!"
3041,"The best halibut I've ever had, hands down. Perfectly prepared, not over seasoned. Service was great and the location is spectacular.If you pass this place up, you're missing an experience."
3042,"These four stars are based off of the atmosphere alone. This is a perfect place set outside of the old port that you can sit back and relax with a nice drink and ocean views.  In the summer the downstairs is open air overlooking the water, with an inside/outside bar. Some People come in off of their boats for lunch while others drive over.  The staff is friendly and the drink list is fun as well. I opted for a prosecco and sat back to enjoy the view. I didn't eat this time, but my husband had the burger which he seemed to really enjoy. On Sundays in the summer pop in for some live music on the deck and enjoy the view!"
3043,"The restaurant itself is very cool. The inside has been updated to be modern and there are even open fire pits to keep you warm while you wait- not to mention the views of the ocean. It is definitely very visually appealing. However, I was not very impressed with the food. Everything that we were served came out cold. Also the portions were very small for the price. 

Overall, I would recommend it if you are going out for drinks or dessert but it didn't seem worth the price tag for any of the entrees."
3044,"Beautiful view of the marina from the deck. Poke Tuna was amazing, as was the bed of greens with sesame soy dressing. Beer battered haddock fish and chips were to die for. Fish was lightly battered like tempura and super moist and flaky. Chips were basically home made potato chips. Delish but needed more vinegar for me."
3045,"Great atmosphere, wonderful view, wonderful bartenders, a very nice relaxing place after a long day at work. Happy hour is reasonable. Very friendly local bar"
3046,"Hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner at the Dockside on a Friday evening in mid-September 2015.  We could not have been happier with our choice.  Andrea was great to work with in planning our event.  

We used the upstairs area which is separate from the restaurant so it is quite private.  There is a bar lounge area where we had the cocktail hour and a dinning room.  There is a deck accessible from both the lounge and the dining room.  The views of Casco Bay are wonderful.

The food, both the appetizers during the cocktail hour and the dinner, was excellent.  Andrea provided a wide selection from which we were able to create a custom menu (salads, entrees, desert).  There is a good selection of beer, winer, liquor and we were able to limit the choices for an open bar.

The service was excellent.  The staff was friendly and responsive.  They served the meals all together and they were hot (something that is hard to do with a large group).

The prices were reasonable given the venue, quality of the food and the service.  Highly recommended."
3047,"There is SO much potential to this place but unfortunately I didn't have a great experience. The hostess was rude (she made a sly remark when I asked for a specific table because it was out of the sun) and our server, although very nice, seemed to forget about us. It was lunchtime and not very busy. The wait time from when we ordered our food to when it arrived was 45 minutes which was unacceptable for 2 sandwiches...as our server didn't check in on us....at all. No drink refills, updates on the food, etc. The food, when it arrived, was very good. And yes, the view is absolutely gorgeous. I would love to give this place another shot based on all the good reviews but I'm pretty hesitant."
3048,"Nice location with lovely views of the Casco Bay. Food is a bit on the pricy side, but I guess that anyplace with a view costs a bit more. 

Lunch selection has a good assortment of seafood and traditional dishes. Waitress was prompt and courteous. Food was hot, right out of the oven. The food was tasty and appetizing of moderate quantity."
3049,"We stopped for a drink and a bite today- it was happy hour and were we happy!! Curry coconut mussels were heavenly!!!  Pulled pork nachos ...Chopped salad with poached pear, cranberries, pecans  and blue cheese- yummy! Great wine at $5.00 glass - we will be back- our server Whitney was very friendly and attentive-definitely enhanced our experience!"
3050,A well kept secret is the excellence of the dockside doughnuts for Sunday Brunch! So delicious!
3051,"DO NOT book your event here.

My fiancee and I made a reservation one year in advance for our rehearsal dinner at the Dockside Grill for a Friday in 2015.

Andrea Marr twice confirmed our reservation a year prior to the event, in July 2014.  We wrote her again in September 2014 to double check our reservation, and she confirmed our reservation for a third time.

Fast forward to November 28, 2014, and we get an email stating she made a mistake and failed to record in their book another party's reservation for our date, and that we were out of luck but could have a Thursday reservation instead.  Her ""mistake"" sounds like a load of BS to me.  A larger party, they stood to make more money from, probably called them four months after we did, and they gave us the shaft.

Customer service leaves a lot to be desired in other ways too.  No telephone call after their boneheaded ""mistake,"" no ""congratulations"" on our engagement or ""thank you"" for choosing their restaurant, and Andrea never once referred to us by our names.  We should have known that was not a good sign but that's why we were diligent and confirmed our reservation three times.

They need to talk to Jerry Seinfeld because, while they know how to *take* the reservation, they don't know how to *hold* the reservation.  ""And that's really the most important part of the reservation.""

Buyer beware."
3052,3rd time coming here. Not impressed. Dislike it when your order doesn't have all of the ingredients in it that are listed on the menu.. Servers need training.  Food is just blah. No flavor at all. Not going back. Ive given them enough chances to get it right.
3053,"I've come here often and always had a good experience. The location is outstanding and the food good. Yesterday was different. Incredibly rude hostess - dismissive and walked away after saying there would be an hour wait (at 2:00 pm and many empty tables). The food is not good enough to justify this behavior. We left and went down the road to the Royal River Grill - outstanding food, staff & location."
3054,"We love The Dockside for its location and atmosphere. Food is pretty good, service is sometimes slow, and it's rather pricey.  Good happy hour drink prices however!"
3055,Excellent view. The crab cake appetizer was amazing. I had the scallops for main entree and they were excellent. Main entrees are all $25+.
3056,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely dinner here. As is clear from all the other reviews, the view is AMAZING. Way better than almost anything we could've gotten downtown. 

I got the salmon with the brown butter-honey glaze, mushroom risotto, and green beans. Salmon was done PERFECTLY - medium rare, incredibly moist and flaky. The brown-butter-honey glaze was mostly just honey and extremely sweet, but it ended up going really well with the mushroom risotto, which was also quite delicious.

My boyfriend got the scallops with mashed potatoes and green beans, and the scallops were also done excellently (nice crisp on the outside, moist on the inside), though the mashed potatoes were in desperate need of some salt.

The parking situation is confusing (different lots for inside vs. patio dining), but it's worth it once you get to the table.

Overall, a very lovely dinner! Would do again!"
3057,"Nice view of Casco Bay.  Fish and chips were excellent .  I had grilled fish tacos because they were out of much of their other seafood.  Tacos were very good.  The waitress said the fresh fish would be delivered in about 20 minutes but we were in a bit of a rush.  We came at the end of lunch rush, so that may have been the problem.  Still, I would recommend"
3058,"Tried giving it a second chance. Bad service, hostess was rude, waitress was great, good spot to get a drink. Waited an hour to get seated after being told it was a 30 minute wait. Could have had a better meal at home for half the price. Great view."
3059,"Went to the Dockside Grill last night for dinner with a friend. We chose this restaurant not because of the food (we had never been there before) but because it was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside.  The view from the Dockside is of Casco Bay and the Handy Boat marina and is just beautiful.  Imagine our surprise when we soon discovered that the food was just as good, if not better, than the view. I ordered seared salmon with chimichurra sauce, polenta and broccolini (you can mix and match the proteins, sides and sauces that you like!).  The food was excellent. The salmon cooked to perfection, the polenta creamy and delicious and the broccolini nice and crisp. The chimichurra sauce was light and full of flavor.  Price wise this isn't your every day diner type of place but well worth it for the view, a great menu and wonderfully prepared food."
3060,My wife and I waited over 1 hour for appetizers and then her soup was cold and my salmon cakes were burnt. And then 30 more minutes for entrees. They were okay. My chips were soggy the fish ok. My wife's chicken was good. Mentioned to waitresses about the  slow service and they not seem too concerned and did nothing. Not high on our list for a return visit.
3061,Great change to the dinner menu! Liked all of the choices! Went for brunch today and it was delicious and they had a great band playing outside!
3062,"Arguably the best panoramic view along Casco Bay! Very convenient if you have a boat. Just dock or hook onto one of many moorings and they can shuttle you in. We tried calamari, oysters, and French fries. Not the best but pretty good and gets the job done. Compared to the old Falmouth seagrill it is much much better! Waitstaff was friendly and attentive! Menu items including Asian fusion of veggie spring roll and tuna wontons for HH. Need to come back and test out there cocktails since we only ordered a corona and 3 Remy Martin XO straight up. Very classy but comfortable outdoor feel if you sit near their open outside bar."
3063,"Went for Sunday brunch.  It was two stars food with four stars venue.  Very nice deck right off the harbor.  Inside also nice with garage doors open- so almost outdoor seating.  Friendly service but the kitchen is slow - our eggs were very slow.  Lobster roll was short on lobster.  Homemade corn beef hash with eggs were ok, not great or even very good.  Toast was cold."
3064,"Went to Dockside Grill recently for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful, as are the views. Our dinner was delicious, we had the shrimp scampi and the haddock. The reason for only 3 stars is that the service was unimpressive. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed- perhaps she was new or stretched thin? Our food actually arrived before our beverages, and we had to ask for the bread that was brought to all the tables around us. It was hard to get her attention throughout the meal- I think another member of the waitstaff dealt with our check. I might return as the food was good and the service seemed a hiccup."
3065,"For all those who avoided this restaurant when it was the Falmouth Sea Grill , you will be pleased to hear that the change has been immense.This is most reflective in the new menu and the food preparation.

I went for dinner recently and was fortunate enough to be with a large group so I was able to sample many different things. First off, the menu construction is similar to that of the Grill Room. It is broken up by Entrees and A La Carte. This is a great option for people who like the looks of the some of the entrees but would like a different side. It allows you to choose your main protein of fish, meat, etc. with 1 sauce and 2 sides. What I particularly liked about this is that the sauce and sides are included in the price of the main. The list of sides is vast (taken from the entrees) and allows for you to mix and match.

Drinks: I was excited that Dockside was featuring infused alcohols. For those that want a bit of flavor without the syrup, juice, etc. this is the perfect option. I had the pomegranate infused vodka with seltzer and a twist of lime. It was light and refreshing and just strong enough. I also sampled one of the seasonal beverages which I was initially nervous about as it was a pumpkin based drink. I expected it to be overly sweet and cinnamon-y but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was light and not overly done. The sparkling wine base helped to lighten the pumpkin puree that was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.

Appetizers: The group I was with sampled a number of appetizers. I am not a shellfish person at all but I absolutely LOVED the mussels. The balance of garlic and the sauce was perfect. They had a special app that night that everyone was raving over: baked brie. The brie was baked in a very light phyllo-dough esque crust and served with a warm berry (not sure what kind) jam. Absolutely delicious. The last appetizer that I tried was the calamari - again, not really a fan of calamari/anything fried but I was willing to give this a try. I loved that it was lightly breaded and non-greasy- additionally, the breading had a bit of spice (jalepeno?) in it which livened up the dish.

Entrees: I had a tough time deciding between an entrée and creating my own ""A La Carte"" entrée. I eventually decided to go A La Carte because one of the main courses and one of the sides in particular are 2 of my favorites. 
I chose the halibut (pan seared with OO, sea salt and pepper) and opted to go sauce-less. Even without a sauce, the halibut was light and moist - not dry and flaky as I thought it might come up. Additionally, the portion was perfect. For sides I chose roasted Brussels sprouts and the ultimate: cauliflower steak (roasted with truffle oil!!!) Brussels sprouts are my favorite and these did not disappoint. They were perfectly roasted to maintain their flavor but were light and slightly crisp on the outside. The cauliflower was to die for (anything with truffle oil basically is). It was perfectly cooked and the truffle oil was faint and nowhere near overwhelming. 

I was able to sample the Salsa Verde and immediately regretted not choosing it for my fish. It was perfectly blended with just the right amount of heat, spice and cool cilantro. I sampled the roasted asparagus as well which was grilled with garlic oil and will definitely be ordering that on my next go-around. The risotto cake was also something I'd like to try.

In summary: a lot of people were not fans of the Falmouth Sea Grill. Although this is in the same location NOTHING is the same.The décor has done a complete 180 as has the food. The head chef obviously clearly puts thought into flavor and composition. I can't wait to come back and enjoy a summer lunch on the patio. Not only is the Dockside Grill worth trying, it's worth putting on your list of regular places to dine."
3066,"This was our first (and probably last) time eating dinner at Dockside Grill.  Our waitress was very friendly, but slooooow.  The room was incredibly loud, to the point of not being able to hear each other talk without yelling.  The food was okay, but overpriced.  Our drinks were weak and also (very) overpriced.  Such a pretty location, but all around disappointing."
3067,"I read Jarad's review and feel compelled to chime in with my own. I too was at the Dockside for mother's day dinner with my husband and my elderly mother, whose favorite food is raw oysters. She was chagrinned to see that oysters were only offered in plates of 6 or 12, and when asked if she could get 8 oysters and 4 clams as her main course, her request was dismissed as too much trouble on a busy night, but the waitress said she would put the request in. When they were served (5 minutes after the ""hot"" entrees), 6 oysters and 6 clams, there was no apology or acknowledgment that the request had been denied. I had a bland panko crusted haddock served over a bed of cold to lukewarm mushroom risotto that was, well, mush and more blandness. The asparagus was overcooked. I was halfway through the meal before the waitress breezed by, said ""so far so good?"", not so much as a question as a pronouncement with no pause for (or interest in) a reply. By the time I swallowed what was in my mouth so that I could plead for some lemon, she was gone. I resigned myself to a mediocre meal with lousy service. We sat over our finished plates for a long time before they were removed. We ordered dessert and waited about 20 minutes for it to be served. We wondered whether our waitress had gone home or simply forgotten us. There was no sign of her, so she wasn't running around waiting on others. She finally surfaced, delivered the desserts with a non-apologetic ""thanks for your patience"", and flew off again, returning a minute later with our check and another ""so far so good?"" as we were just starting the desserts. The creme brulee, my final hope, had a paper thin crust in the center, nothing on the edges.  I'm not one to complain and didn't in the moment, in an effort to make the evening as pleasant as possible. I had been to Dockside only once before and had a good (though not excellent) meal with decent service.  One can make up for the other, but both bad food and service will make it unlikely that I will ever return.
 A final point: the bad service was not the fault of one individual server. It's a management, training and quality control issue."
3068,Three of us had dinner. I had the hanger steak with port wine sauce. Steak had nice grill flavor and the sauce was excellent. My wife had the salmon and she liked it very much. My mother-in-law had the scallops and she enjoyed those. I had 3 ipa's and enjoyed those. We used to go to this restauraunt when it was the falmouth sea grill but then it was bought out and it was awful. But all 3 of us enjoyed our meal. Two of us had green beans and mashed potatoes as sides and there was plenty of beans and plenty of potatoes. Very nice. We will be back.
3069,"Came in for mothers day with high expectations. First off bread was served without small plates and crumbs ended up scattered all over the table.  Then we ordered apps and the waitress took our menus and ran off before we had a chance to order entrees. Finally we flagged her down to order our main courses while looking foolish.  After 30 minutes a soup and fried calamari came out along with my son's grill cheese, which was way to long for a soup and a fried app.  My sons grilled cheese was cooked on one side was soggy, even a 7 year old was wondering how you could mess up a grilled cheese sandwich.  Less then five minutes after our entrees came out all the while still eating our appetizers the waitress said ""sorry for the overlap""?.  Why would the chef send entrees out knowing he just sent the apps 30 minutes after we ordered?  And that's a proper excuse?  The tuna was terrible and absolutely flavorless.  I asked the waitress to take it off and she responded with the manager said there was nothing wrong with the dish even though she had never came over to see or taste the dish.  It was supposed to be an herb risotto with a sesame crusted tuna but was more like a non salted tuna with an 8 ounce pile of light green overcooked rice tasting like it was recooked with water, not stock or herbs.  When the manager came by after I insisted to see her;  she told me she never gets a complaint and i explained what was wrong with the dish.  The tuna was 28 dollars on the menu which is not pocket change and her excuse was ""oh it was a busy weekend"".  So, when it is busy the chef can't make sure the line cooks season the food correctly? I thought being busy was a good thing not an excuse to throw junk on a plate and think its ok.  

Overall I think this resultant needs to pay more attention to the details.  No plates when the bread is served is not thinking, saying that the chefs can just sling junk on the plate not paying attention to the plating and seasoning of the dish because they were busy, telling the customer ""sorry for the overlap"" when the app was served 30 minutes late and entree right after so it sits and gets cold is horrendous management to charge 30 bucks an entree.  

I usually don't send food back because I am a chef myself and usually don't write a review but the staff here needs to understand that being busy is the point of working at a restaurant.  For the chef, if you saw that plate of risotto and tuna go out with soy reduction all over the rim of the plate you need to stop the cook and tell him to focus because business goes down the drain by serving like that.  

At the end they recooked the food and it tasted much better but my family was done eating and i got it packed up to go.  Both apps were comped but the dinner was still rough to stomach.  

Chef, keep an eye on every dish and make sure your cooks don't just throw food in the pan and reheat it, make sure it tastes good before your send it out and waitstaff don't tell the customer that you are sorry for the overlap because thats not an excuse for poor service, make sure the food isn't fired until the customer is ready."
3070,"Food was delicious. It was a beautiful day and we took a walk on the dock. The chop salad was a favorite. Overall, a delightful luncheon!"
3071,"View, food, and service were outstanding. No complaints. Had seared scallops, done to perfection!!!"
3072,The view on the deck was great. Food was hit or miss.  Lobster roll was tasty but skimped on the lobster.  The fries were a mix of regular and sweet potato.  The sweet potato fries were really good but the regular fries were soggy. I'd be willing to give it another try because it mostly tasted good but the overall was pretty average.
3073,It is a little hidden treasure and a wonderful welcome to Maine!  We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and the spectacular vista!
3074,"Simply put this is an epic place to eat, drink and little to live music while taking in the good summer weather. I had the lobster roll and mussels which were both delicious. Try the strawberry jalapeño infused margarita if you like something spicy and refreshing. You can tell the place has received a healthy investment and is here to stay. Plus the ample parking is a huge plus."
3075,"Husband and I live in the Portland area and went for dinner. Tried to use their ""make a reservation"" link on their website using my phone. Didn't work (form wouldn't go through) so I tried on two other devices unsuccessfully. Finally called and was told they don't take reservations???! Went over early and got a table. To say that the noise was deafening is not an exaggeration - we literally could not have a conversation. One couple left because of the noise and we watched other tables give up even trying to converse. Saw a table open up close to the outside deck and asked to move (before our food came) in hopes that being on the edge of the room would help. The manager refused, curtly saying ""it will be just as loud no matter where you sit."" Food was fine and waitress was very apologetic but the overall experience was terrible - we wasted our time and our money. I sent a polite email to the owner explaining what happened and telling her I'd rather let her know directly rather than complaining about the experience to others. Got no response. Will never eat there again and can't recommend it to anyone. Maybe they have enough tourist business that they don't care about repeat customers?"
3076,"Yum yum yum. I would like to park myself at Parker's all day. You have to try the Thai chicken strips. Freshly pounded chicken, sliced -- lightly breaded. The perfect mix of not too spicy but a little kick. Served on a bed on greens.

If you like beer, you'll also find a tremendous selection and the COLDEST taps in town.

And I can't say enough about the chicken parm I ordered for my main course. Better than any Italian restaurant."
3077,"I have to say that the drinks were amazing but the food not so much. It tasted like it has been in a cooler for a while and then tried to by heated up, even though they weren't meant to be froze and cooked back up again."
3078,"Once, a long time ago in a galaxy far away there was a restaurant called F. Parker Reidy's in the Old Port that was amazing.  A couple of the guys who worked there established Parker's in North Deering and for a time it was pretty darn good.  They've a great bar frequented by locals and always pour a hearty drink.  However, I dined at Parker's recently and was disappointed with the quality of my meal in contrast with what I remember about the venue from going there more regularly a few years back.  All in all not a bad place if you want to go out for drinks and live in the hood."
3079,"Went in on a Saturday evening with a friend. Was a bit cautious going in after reading some of the reviews on Yelp. I'm very happy I went in.  Ordered the calimari with marinara and finished with the roast turkey sandwich. Everything was piping hot and delicious. My friend ordered the prime rib which was fantastic. Extremely tender and well seasoned I will be ordering it on my next visit.
Service was exceptional. Prompt and friendly. Decor and ambiance was pleasant not the dark hovel some reviews on here seem to believe. Looking forward to my next visit."
3080,They had a great onion rings great cheeseburgers love them and loved there Service they were nice and i would recommend coming here
3081,"We went here for lunch, it was very good. The restaurant is a tad dated but you're able to look beyond that when they have maple roasted brussel sprouts that taste like a pecan maple heaven. 

I got the chicken Cobb salad and it delivered to be exactly that, a Cobb salad. 

My boyfriend got a chicken Cordon bleu sandwich which he said was ""yummy"" and I say ""Holy shit balls, that sandwich is stupid good"" 

You should go here!!"
3082,"While I've not had real good luck with dining there in the past, I went last evening and I had an excellent server and one of the best steaks I've had in a very long time. As a matter fact whenever I've had a steak here, it has been delicious. I can't get past the dark and outdated atmosphere but I can overlook that for a darn good sirloin - and cooked to perfection. My guess steak was equally as good and so are his mashed potatoes."
3083,"Parker's is an early 80's time warp....on several levels. The color scheme and lighting is dark....reminding you of sales guys swigging two martinis trying to close a sale at lunch back in the day....if everyone was smoking Marlboro's...you see my time warp vision. It doesn't stop there...this neighborhood bar has literally up to fifty 65-70 year old regulars....they were there in the 80's.....still there. The menu items....80's again....big burgers, those oversized steak fries, a haddock and tarter sandwich that could weigh down a tug boat, you get the picture.....quintessential 80's.....now all this said, I go to Parkers a few times a year for a couple beers....always at the bar, and a rare burger and fries. Talk golf with the old regulars, sit back, and morph in a good way back to the classic 80's.

The place is what it is....and that's not all bad. Have a laugh, a couple beers, and enjoy a north deering bar staple. 

3 stars....more for nostalgia....but hey, try the dude rancher...it's been on the menu for 35 years...ha"
3084,"Ok we stopped in here before heading out to the movies for the evening.  We saw this little place tucked away behind the main road of Washington Ave where you literally would miss it if you went by at a fast pace.

We got in and when we first walked in it was like the scene from a movie where people walk into a bar where the music stops and everyone turns their heads to see who just walked in.  The crowd was a MUCH older group and we wanted to watch some of the football game that was on the television but had to ask them to turn it on.

The waiter came over to table where the lighting was extrmely low and the decor was of an old tavern that almost had the feel of damp and dank.  The waiter literally could have been doing something totally different than what he was doing to help us two young patrons.  He slapped the single shot menus at us and when we asked about a couple of the items on the menu, I literally thought I was asking about the meaning of life where he had no idea.

My friend chose to go with the steak kabobs and I chose to go with the dirty wings and they were both just so-so and both were definitely frozen at one time or another and it definitely tasted like it.

I am not going with one star here with this because it has bits of good here like cold beer and a pretty good beer selection.

We will not be heading back to Parker's anytime soon it is just not appealing to me."
3085,"If you love dark, dreary, 80s bars you will love Parker's!  It needs a serious face lift & better food if I were to go back, which I probably will not.  I read in a local publication that the Dirt Wings are amazing.  So I knew I had to have them. We stuck to the app theme and got apps for dinner.  We got:  Dirt Wings, Fried Calamari, Coconut Shrimp, & Thai Chicken Fingers.  All pretty big disappointments.  I've had better wings at chain restaurants, the fried calamari was over cooked, tough & lacking flavor, the coconut shrimp was as good as the frozen version I get at Trader Joe's, which is good but I prefer to not have frozen apps when at a restaurant & speaking of frozen the thai chicken fingers were barely edible & definitely frozen.  The pic looks like they are amazing & let me tell you... they are not.  There are so many options around Portland, do not waste your time or money @ Parker's."
3086,8-18-17 excellent food and service. We were a bit of a pain but well seasoned waiter was very accomadating! Fine fresh seafood. We will be back!
3087,"Hadn't been here in a year or so, and not entirely sure why, maybe just because it's outside of downtown and a little hidden. Think the last time I was here a friend was being a jerk or something and because the experience sucked, I thought it was Parker's. 

ANYhow, It's not my neighborhood bar, but I sure wish it was! You certainly get treated like you've been going there your whole life if you sit down at the bar, which is part of what makes this place so special. The crowd as others mention, is on the older side, but that's more than okay with me, as they're a heck of a lot more fun than most of the people my age! Swearing up a storm, teasing each other, just having a great time. 

Looking at the other reviews, I was amazed, as I didn't even know they had a dining room. I have always been to the bar side, and that's definitely the fun side. Wings were excellent, salad was nothing gourmet, but everything seemed fresh enough and for $7.99 it was huge. Two of us barely split it. Food obviously wasn't too involved but came out quick. Service was through the bartender, and she was just as sweet as can be and super attentive to everyone. 

Places like this are way too far and few between these days. A place where you can get some good pub food at a decent price, have a few drinks and some great conversations with strangers. I guess maybe if you sit over in the dining room, things are a bit boring and then you start looking at smoke detectors and listening to the AC, etc. But come on over to the pub side and surely someone will make you feel at home real quick, and you'll leave with a smile on your face."
3088,"A perfect disaster. One has to wonder how this restaurant is still open.  There were three in our party. Our drink order arrived ten minutes after it was taken. Our dinner order took over 1 hour to be served. A meat appetizer, ordered well done, arrived RAW. A burger, ordered medium, arrived well done. Ordered a baked potato and was served French fries. Inquired about the meal 45 minutes into the wait and was told that everything was on the grill. The meat appetizer must have been frozen solid to have been on the grill for 15 minutes and then served RAW. Or we were lied to by the server.  This doesn't even deserve one star. Stay away from Parkers and you won't be sorry."
3089,"While the crowd is a bit on the older side, the overall friendly and warm atmosphere and unbelievable bloody mary make it a 5 star for me!"
3090,"It was like stepping into a dark cave. There was no hostess, when we finally were seated , the waitress took forever to appear. Worst part was I ordered squash ravioli - asked the waitress what was IN it - she had NO IDEA & claimed that a salad did NOT come with the meal - even though it was printed on the menu that it did. Terrible service & even worse food. If there were negative stars, I would rate it with those."
3091,"I just tried to have a nice welcome home dinner for my husband that just got back from Afghanistan, the service was really slow not to mention how rude the GM was, he literally kicked us out! just because we complaint about the food which you have the right to do as a costumer, also he said well I can give you boxes and you guys can get going!. I really can't believe how we were treated!"
3092,"Great food! Big portions, and good service.  Their home  made ranch dressing is the best I've ever tasted! And their chicken cordon blue, pizzas, and prime rib are some of their best dishes.  My girlfriend and I live on Auburn street, so it was nice to find a place so close with so much to offer!"
3093,"Ok food more old style but good. Interior decor, exterior decor and food have not been modernized and really need to be! The bar was very busy and the dining room was not. During the two hours we were there the bar just got busier and louder. Its good that the dining room was separate but it felt more like a ""happy several hours"" place than a relaxing restaurant."
3094,"Decent food.  Menu hasn't changed in years.  Here's the big issue:   We are in a craft beer revolution in Portland, ME and Parker's refuses to put anything decent on their draught line or in bottles.  They're so archaic that Harpoon has been their IPA for about 10 years.  Awful.  Get with it or something is gonna come in to North Deering that has a clue."
3095,"This neighborhood ""restaurant"" is in need of a Restaurant Impossible makeover.  The decor is dated. The lighting flickered high/low throughout our meal. The smoke detector dangled from the dining room ceiling. The ac was loud and caused the floor to shake when it kicked on. The service is slow and inattentive.  The dining room was not very busy with only 4 or 5 additional tables with patrons. We were seated for 20 minutes before we were even asked if we would like drinks by which time we were ready to place our order.  It took 30 minutes for the appetizer to arrive and an additional 20 minutes for the main course. I had the house haddock dinner, the fish was flavorful but the rice was like rubber and not able to be consumed. The portion of chicken parm was generous but had the distinct taste of dish soap. The bar to this establishment was hopping and is clearly how they generate enough revenue to remain in business. We will not be returning anytime in the near future."
3096,We have been going to Parkers for years.  It is a comfortable and fun neighborhood bar / restaurant with a fantastic staff and very consistent food.  Try the fresh made artichoke dip........amazing!!!
3097,"Sadly this once decent restaurant has become a shadow of its former self. After several years of not dining there we decided to give it another try.
Let me just say that the view is fantastic, the staff pleasant and it's a great spot to watch the sunset and have a cocktail. The food is fine, nothing special and nothing terrible, good spot to bring the
Kiddies. The real problem is no one is looking with the customers eyes. The last thing I want to see when I walk into a restaurant is cleaning g supplies on the drink fridge, right there at check in! Sticky table cloths and grubby menus add to the turn off before you have even ordered. 
This fantastic spot hardly lives up to its potential and the food would taste so much better if the whole place too more pride in the customer experience."
3098,"Well, what can we say?  It was open. And on a rainy day on the island we were happy to see that door ajar. However, because the place was closing for the season in a few days there was nothing screaming at us to make us return.  The food?  unspectacular. Wouldn't go back."
3099,"No where near what the other reviews make this place out to be. Had a few drinks while waiting for the ferry. Beer was cold, view was amazing, waitress was attentive, and the food the table next to us got looked good. Not sure what the other prissy missie's were expecting, but I give this place two solid thumbs up!"
3100,"So so so so slow. We got there and wanted to sit outside and they said a fifteen minute wait, so we wandered around and came back. Then we got drinks, waited, ordered food, and from the time we were seated to the time we got food it took an hour. The fish and chips were pretty spendy and looked really dry, plus didn't have much fish. My portobello sandwich was good, no complaints there. But I'm glad I got that and not one of the meals. I dunno, it's a small island and not a lot for a tourist to do. But I'd skip this one next time."
3101,"We chose this restaurant because of the view from the outside deck. The view was worth five stars. The service was a bit slow, but very friendly. I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries, it was cooked medium well which is their standard. I like my burgers medium rare so it was a bit on the dry side. My wife had a chicken sandwich with avocado, which she liked very much. Fries were good, coleslaw head too much mail in it. If you want to eat lunch with a great view, nice breeze, This would be a good place to eat."
3102,"Atrocious.

Really bad.

Tourist trap - big time....

The majority of reviews for this place are unfavorable.

They have a view, and thats it.

I wonder where the residents of Peaks go to eat because there is no place even remotely good to eat...

Portland I guess.

Condolences."
3103,"We saw the restaurant from the ferry and thought it would be a good place for a beer on a nice day.  Walked into the restaurant and a got some stares from the few people who were sitting there, who it turned out were all workers because there weren't any customers inside.  Not sure if there was a hostess, I spoke in their general direction and asked to sit out on the deck.  One of them said sure, go ahead and jerked his head toward the deck.  

So we walked out onto the large deck.  The good part was that there were several empty tables and they had a nice view of the water from a high vantage point.  The downer was that none of these tables had been bused and there were empty glasses, tableware and food particles on all of them.  After a few minutes of sitting there, we walked out.  Save your time and go elsewhere.  A pity, since it's a great location."
3104,"First thing we noticed was it was dead. We were seated outside, quickly, on a Friday night... that was our first cue. Then I noticed the clutter. There was stuff everywhere.. cleaning supplies, small unfinished projects.. etc. the table cloth was super sticky and dirty. After learning that all their fried foods had dairy, due to my allergy, my choices were limited. So I asked for a chicken sandwich with fries. The waitress who was still in high school I presume was unimpressed and couldn't have cared less about us. She told us they were out of fries. On a Friday evening! So I asked if we could substitute for the  sweet potato fries. She said yes, for an up charge of $2.50. This place was a rip off. I'm not going to pay $15 for a chicken sandwich. I ended up getting nothing and the person with me got a lobster roll for $22.95 it was ok but not for that price. This place sucks. Don't waste your money here."
3105,"Way too long of wait for food that was just OK. The food wasn't good or bad, just OK. The wait wasn't really anyone's fault. Restaurant looked very short staff. I would just recommend going when the crowd looks moderate to none. Otherwise, bring your own food or go to the cafe."
3106,"Walking in to the establishment felt as if it was going to be disorganized.   Nothing is dirty, however they should pay attention to the small details.  Counter at which you pay (display counter) didn't have anything really in it.   Looking around you could see lots of what I assume is staffs water bottles, silverware that was just hanging out in a table, things should be tidy.  We were seated quickly and this is where it went downhill.  I asked husband to grab me a water.  Waited for bathroom for about 5 minutes (nothing bad about waiting just giving time reference).  Came back to table and waited another 7 minutes to just get drinks of water.  He ordered a beer and now waiting as I write this.   It's been about 20 minutes total since arrived to just get a beer.  The view is amazing! It can't be beat as it overlooks everything.  He had forgotten beer and had to order again.  So took 26 minutes to get a beer.  Beer tastes well and we did not stay for food. Overall needs to be more organized.   Might be great for food."
3107,"Our running joke after leaving this place was ""At least the view was nice."" We had ""brunch"" here on a Sunday; the choices were slim. Two of us ordered chicken tenders and a basket of fries to share; two of us ordered an English muffin egg sandwich with a hash brown (legit like the frozen one from McDonald's). It took nearly two hours to receive our food. There were MAYBE 10 tables open on the entire deck. Three of us had a beer each, and the total bill was nearly $90. Just. No. No, no, no."
3108,"The staff is very nice and courteous. Great view of the water front. 

Everything else about the place is not so great. Kind of dirty.

Worst lobster roll I've ever had. Tasteless. For $19, I expect a juicy, sweet lobster roll. I didn't get that, not even close.  I should have known better since I did notice no one else in the dining room ordered it. Sigh. Most people ordered burgers and fries. I guess it was too much to ask that a waterfront establishment in Maine to have tasty lobster. Sigh."
3109,"nice view and friendly staff BUT horribly slow service and very mediocre food. I ordered the lobster roll which cost $18. it was a total rip off because it was tiny and dry. my mom got a veggie burger and wanted a side of guacamole but it was probably a teaspoon of it spread on top. she ask so asked for a side of summer squash and zucchini which came with about 6 slices total. my dad ordered the seafood pasta which sounded amazing on the menu but it came with overlooked linguini, 3 shrimp, 2 mussels and probably frozen and reheated scallops. definitely come to the island to walk around but head back to Portland for dinner. overall DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you want to waste your money, time and stomach space. to end on a nice note they did let me charge my phone."
3110,"Avoid the swordfish special. 
It was not fresh and was drenched in a lemon vinagrette to cover it up. It wasn't terrible but for the price you're better off with menu entrees. The fried haddock and fried scallops seem to be a favorite. The clams chowder was good but lacks clams."
3111,"We stumbled upon this place just as it was opening and we were not disappointed. The chowder (bacon and corn) was excellent- I wish we got more! The chowder was just what I was looking for from a seaside restaurant. Our sandwiches were very flavorful, especially the Hawaiian Chicken. With a great view and great food, we were impressed and recommend it to anyone heading to Peaks Island! It is not a fancy or upscale place, but for a quick bite to eat after exploring the island, we enjoyed our visit!"
3112,"Blah. Average service, overpriced good, mediocre drinks. The only good thing about this place is the fantastic view! Smoked salmon BLT was ridiculously salty, and came out with cold fries. I wanted to order the iconic Maine lobster roll, but they must have been out of lobster as it wasn't even offered on the menu. Waitress seemed uninterested and unimpressed with her current occupation. Of the 3 places to eat on this island, this place comes in with a solid bronze medal."
3113,"Any time I walk into a restaurant and there are posters with various rules all over the place I get turned off immediately and leave- but bc I was on an island and starving we stayed.
It was great- I got a salad and bowl of their salmon corn chowder-
The chowdahh was the best I've had in New England! Make sure to get a salad basaltic red onions in it- not to be missed!
Not dog friendly!"
3114,Unfortunately nothing special. Lobster roll is more like lobster on a hot dog bread. For that price i would expect a litle more love and detail. One thing is for sure great views to gave a beer.
3115,"Great place to stop if visiting. The potato slices were terrific, my burger was cooked exactly the way I wanted, and the staff was super friendly. I've been coming here since I was five and they are still finding ways to tickle my pickle. Just lovely."
3116,We had very tasty food the day after Thanksgiving. We had the bbq turkey leg and bacon mac and cheese. Johnny made our experience enjoyable by chatting with us and  being hilarious. He also gave us tips for where to go sightseeing on the island. I'd definitely go back.
3117,"Everything was tasty enough.  Just FYI, the lobster roll is only like 6-7"" long and it's $19... I saw the lobster salad and it looks like there is a ton of lobster for $2 more."
3118,"We stopped in here when we missed our ferry -- oops! Delicious gin & tonics, okay food. We loved the outdoor patio area (covered, thankfully!), too!"
3119,"Different mgt over the years, but not different results -- food is consistently mediocre to poor.  If it were not for one-time tourists, they would probably fail -- we give up and will not return -- nice location with outdoor seating (except at Sundown when sun comes under the awning and is uncomfortably hot and blinding to those on the side of the table looking out to sea) -- maybe somebody will turn it around someday, but for now it is a major disappointment."
3120,"Popped over here for a quick snack while we waited for the ferry back to Portland after we had carted around the island. I didn't have the full dining experience as we only had a couple appetizers. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised. We had the vegetarian nachos which were both filing and tasty (my wife kept raving about the guacamole) and our friends had the shrimp cocktail which they quite enjoyed.

The restaurant itself is nothing spectacular; it's a little dated inside and could use a sprucing up. However, the views while dining on the patio were amazing and the staff was super friendly and attentive. If you are on Peaks Island and want to stop for a bite, you'd do well stopping here."
3121,"THE LOBSTAH CHRONICLES
Day 4, Part 1

Back in Portland, ME now and we decided to take the 20 minute ride on the  Casco Bay Lines ferry over to Peak's Island.  It was delightful making  the trip over.  Upon exiting the ferry, we followed the throng of people up the hill.  Making a right turn we passed the Inn on Peak's Island having an all-you-can-eat pork roast for the holiday.  Folks were lined up out the door.  We walked on by and came to the Peak's Island House Restaurant.  This was a little gem of a place.  Outdoor seating on their covered deck overlooked the dock and an expansive view of Casco Bay and the city of Portland in the distance.  

Again, this was a non-lobster meal but delicious nonetheless.  We shared a potato skin (real potatoes!  ...see the review of The Lobster Trap in North Conway , NH) appetizer.  Nicely filled with potatoes and topped with melted cheese...a good portion of 6 skins.  My husband ordered a fried clam appetizer for his main menu item.  He raved about their taste and size.  He was happy.  I had the haddock sandwich and, again, it was lightly fried with a flaky, moist inside...forget the bun, just enjoy the fish!  It came with a side of cole slaw.   This is only 1 of 4 restaurants on Peak's Island but I would come back and try something different on the menu."
3122,"Ugh. it was a very very hot day but we ferried over to Peak's Island for a visit and lunch. Tried this place which had a nice view but that's about it. I had the clam cakes and they must have been deep fried about 3 times given what they looked and tasted like, and how long it took to make. My husband had watery chowder and my son had chicken tenders that were anything but LOL, they were also double or triple fried. Overall we just felt gross after eating here. It's a nice setting but not worth it."
3123,Meh. The food is absolutely mediocre. Don't waste the money. I bet the hot dog guy across the street is nicer and has better food.
3124,Second time here and the food and staff are great very little  waiting around to be seated great spot if you are on the island for a day or just for lunch
3125,"The restaurant has a nice porch that allows customers to look out at the water. The service is extremely slow though- my friend and I must have waited at least 20 minutes for any food and 10 more minutes just to pay the bill. The waitress actually got my order wrong, but I was so hungry and was not trying to wait another 20 minutes for the correct meal, so I just ate what was given to me. My friend got the lobster roll, which he said was good, but it was extremely small and definitely not worth the $19. Next time I'm on Peaks Island I'll try another lunch spot."
3126,"Affordable good food, local beer and refreshing drinks, large outside deck offering breathtaking ocean/Portland views. What more can you ask for? This place was perfect after our bike ride around the island. No wait, fast service. If Im ever back to Peaks, this is where Ill be!"
3127,"Dirty and outdated decor. Terrible service. Order the fried food, it's tough to screw up. We had the salmon special, took almost 45 minutes to arrive to the table. Lukewarm when it arrived. Salmon was dry, overlooked and a very small portion for the price. Avoid this place and go over to the Gull for a great meal and better service."
3128,"Quint, no frills inn, but you can't beat the view!"
3129,"Fun summer family meal! with attentive, friendly service from Jennie."
3130,"Let me start off by saying that coming to Peaks Island during the off season was not the best idea. We didn't realize that the whole island was pretty much shut down, save for a few businesses that were open. The Cockeyed Gull being one of them. 

It was a particularly cold and blustery day on the island. Trying our hardest to find some respite from the cold, we walked into the grocery store that was next door and grabbed some coffees, not realizing this spot was open. They were cool about us bringing in our coffee. 

I love the view from here. Nice little space to keep warm while watching the winds out on the water. 

The waitress who served us was super nice. She knew we were sitting around to kill time so she was fine with us hanging out. 

We ordered the crab cakes as a starter. This was really good! Hubs got the clam chowder which he liked - I loved the shrimp tacos!! The shrimp were very fresh and plump. I got a Murphy's to drink while waiting around. 

We also managed to squeeze in dessert. The waitress recommended  the carrot cake. It was super delicious!! 

This place definitely deserves 5 stars."
3131,"This spot is a good stop if you are out in the island.  I went with my family and they did an awesome job serving us so we could make the next ferry with the kids.

The food was good, but I did think it was rather over priced.  We had a scallop dish that was over 15$ and it was like 4 scallops.  They were well cooked and the sauce tasted good, but not for that price point. Also the shrimp tacos were around the same price for two tacos.  That's even more than Portland prices!

I would hesitate to stop here for drinks, which are standard price and menu."
3132,We got wine and the seafood stew. The stew was good but not the best I've had. The atmosphere is very nice with a nice outdoor deck overlooking the water.
3133,"Overpriced food, small portions and snarky service. 

If you are looking for better food, better service and more outdoor space I highly suggest eating at the Inn at Peaks which is just right up the road.

A lobster roll is around 30 dollars which is way more than it should be. My friend and I split an order of shrimp tacos and scallops. I don't remember exact prices, but I do remember receiving tiny portions and spending way more than I should. With a glass of wine lunch came to around 40 PP, and we still left hungry. 

Service was incredibly slow, and it just seems like the type of spot where the staff does not feel the need to go out of their way for anyone."
3134,"Not sure why this place has 3 stars overall, but I'm going to bump that here.

My sister and I were on Peaks Island for a Bob Marley comedy show, but we wanted to grab dinner before the show.  Considered some places on the mainland...but finally decided that the Cockeyed Gull would work since it was close to the place where the show was.

I had the Clam Chowder to start and enjoyed the Sesame Crusted Salmon with Seaweed salad and broccoli.

Added some Tabasco to the Clam Chowder (which was great alone, but needed some kick for me).  Then on to the Salmon, WOW, great job with it!  Very tasty!!

My sister enjoyed her Coconut Crusted Haddock as well.

Service matched the food.

The view off the patio?  WOW!  Very nice and worth going in the summer just for that.  Enjoyed the sunset over the city.

Parking?  Here?  Don't!  There isn't any, or much.

Look forward to my next visit!!!"
3135,"We had a fantastic dinner at Cockeyed Gull for our anniversary! A good friend of mine is working there for the summer and when I was stumped on where to go for our anniversary, she suggested coming here. It's like a getaway except it's only a 20 - 25 min ferry ride from Portland! I called on Labor Day and snagged us a table for that evening at 6pm. I was told the dinner menu is much different from the lunch menu (which I've never had).We got a table for 6pm and took the 530pm ferry out of Portland. It was a lovely boat ride and the Cockeyed Gull is just steps away from the ferry dock, to the left. 

We got a spot on the deck (prime spot according to the wait staff!) in the corner. We watched the sun set and enjoyed some beer and wine. The dinner menu is Asian influenced. The owner and her son, who works there, have created a really unique fusion menu for guests! I overheard a couple of folks being worried it was too ""spicy"" for them because they're used to old school mashed potatoes. I however LOVED the menu. We started off with the lobster and edamame fritters with a spicy dipping sauce. Generous portions of lobster in these for just an app! They were very good and there were way more of them then we expected. 

For dinner I ordered the asian style lamb chops with bok choy, slaw and potato wedges. The wedges were browned perfectly on the outside and you could soak up the sauce with them. The lamb was cooked medium, just like I asked. Very tender. My husband ordered the hangar steak, medium with wasabi mashed potatoes, ginger pop-over (SO GOOD) and bok choy. The ginger pop-over had just enough ginger, not too much. 

We were too stuffed to get desert at the end but we we stayed just long enough to finish as the sun went down. We took the 7:45pm ferry back to Portland. It was a beautiful night! If we get more good weather this fall, I encourage Portlanders to take the ferry over to the Cockeyed Gull for dinner. Small town / island life just steps away from bustling Commercial Street!"
3136,The shrimp tacos are the bomb!! Beautiful outdoor eating patio. Lobster roll was also good.
3137,"One of 3 places to pick on the island to eat and we picked the one that doesn't seem to like tourists. It was evident that the locals were treated far better than the visitors. The young man at the door was a pleasure and seemed to feel guilty about the way we were being treated. Starting with the bartender, didn't crack a smile and seemed bothered by questions. We were seated at a table inside and although we were only having drinks there while we waited for an outside table, the waitress came to us 35 minutes later apologizing for the delay and asked us if we were ready to order( obviously no menus).
We were then seated outside, another 39 minute wait, where finally a different waitress came over and took pity on us and took our order.
The food was good. If you go maybe say that your the cousin of a local - hopefully it will help!"
3138,"The service was a little slow, but I think that's a product of the fact that we were there in the off season. The food was great.  I had the pork bulgogi lettuce wraps. They were as good as any I've had at Korean restaurants and the house made kimchi was a star! My wife had the haddock and it was great as well. A surprising find for a little island joint!"
3139,Service was slow. When we arrived the restaurant might have had 4 tables with guests. Food took forever. Took my wife to ask about it before someone figured it out. Appetizer got rang up with the main meal so we got all our food at once. Had to find another waiter to get beer refills. Go see peaks island and eat in Portland.
3140,"The patio views are amazing.  We came from midwest to Portland for a long weekend, and one of our lyft drivers recommended taking the ferry to Peak's for the day.  By day 2 in Portland we were tired of the same old, and really happy we came to Peaks for great views and something different.  Cockeyed was the first restaurant we passed (maybe the only one).  We did have a longer wait as we requested to sit outside only - the patio and views are just beautiful.  Our server initially was a bit abrasive and we could all tell he didn't want to be there, oh also pretty much told us he was exhausted by tourists....
Anywayyy after he realized how much food & wine we were ordering he became nicer. 
Shrimp tacos - yum
scallops - yum, but small
fish & chips - amazing, larger size
Veggie asian noodles- yum!
had the lobster stew & clam chowder - each yummy"
3141,"We only stopped in for a few cold beers. Did meet some locals sitting at the bar, which is always a treat. Bartender was the soft silent type, but we made the best of it. We did not eat here, although the back deck had a nice inviting breeze. Worth a squeak stop no doubt"
3142,"It's the only place open this time of year. After a great day of Yelp Help service we took a tour around the island. 

It was a great day. We worked hard today and made some new friends along the way. 

So having a beer was in demand and we had time before the ferry. So happy to see it was open.  Good size place. Not sure about the food but for a quick beer it is fine. A bit pricey but nice place to connect with others. 

Easy access to the ferry too."
3143,"Usually restaurants with a beautiful water view are a little sub par when it comes to cuisine. Not the case at the Gull! The chef owner is Korean, so order anything Asian on the menu and you will not be sorry! Also had an amazing steak and cheese and incredible crab cake. Our waiter was sweet and funny, very attentive. Will absolutely be back!"
3144,"A great little bar on Peaks Island! It's where to real Islanders drink! I should know, I once was one!!"
3145,"This family owned restaurant has the best food on Peaks Island. Cute little bar pours a good drink, charming restaurant space and a kicking porch with perfect view, make this a local gem. Food is very good and there is a talented chef in the kitchen. The restaurant owner is Korean and some of the featured menu items have a Asian twist on New England classics, like steamed mussels and baked clams. Lovely salads, tasty sandwiches and fresh local fish. I had a watermelon and feta salad that was refreshing and filling, my vegetarian nieces enjoyed the manicotti, another guest was delighted by the Asian fried chicken and my daughter raved about the salmon. This is a spot loved by those who have homes on the island and tourists alike. Don't miss the key lime pie for dessert and if you are lucky enough to get a deck seat enjoy the view!"
3146,"hm no wonder this place is barely holding onto three stars. I mean, for one of the few places remaining open for the season, you'd think their performance would be above average.
I didn't even get to eat here, and that's the problem. waited for 10 min that's barely full of people, without any acknowledgment, and I was just by myself. all I wanted was a quick bite to eat in peace in a bar or something. but no. the waiter AND hostess passed by me multiple times with no 'hello' or 'be right with you'. I was about to seat myself since I saw two seats at the bar unoccupied - but I didn't want to be rude since I saw the sign 'please wait to be seated' so I held onto my patience.
what made me walk out the door was when the waiter/hostess totally blew me off and attended a customer next to me (and screw that customer next to me because she knew I was waiting) AND told them to sit at said unoccupied seats at the bar. the couple in front of me had the audacity to say to me what a good waitress she is - yea right, she can't even handle a shack like restaurant that maximizes only 30 people. the only thing going for this place is the deck with a view.

in all honesty and better suggestion, I would recommend grabbing breakfast AND lunch/brunch at the cute Cafe right when you enter peaks island from ferry entrance. the owner (I think) is very humble, attentive, and friendly. and you can grab you food to go and walk to the ferry dock and enjoy the view that way. boom."
3147,"Don't put your stock in the negative reviews, this place is classic New England.

What tops off a day of biking, hiking, exploring and beaching? Lobster rolls and gin martinis. Obviously. 

We sat on the deck in the sun overlooking Casco Bay, a really pretty view. The place is clean and quaint - no fuss no muss - and our server Maddie was really genuine, attentive and accommodating. 

I love a good stiff martini, and wasn't disappointed. The lobster roll was uncomplicated and delicious- hot dog bun, very fresh lobster, mayo, lemon, salt and pepper, with a generous portion of fries that were cooked and seasoned well. 

This place is near the ferry dock, and is a perfect last stop. If you're looking for some sort of ""elevated dining experience"", go someplace else. These guys understand and nail the core basics, and I appreciate that. If you are craving some seared ahi seaweed salad bullshiii and like a diet mojito or whatever, this isn't for you. 

I am giving 5 stars on the basis that it was a kick ass day and this was a very nice topper to it"
3148,"The exterior might turn you off, but give this place a chance. Best burger on the island. Excellent French fries. Really friendly service and a gorgeous harbor view. My one suggestion is to bring sunglasses if enjoying lunch there; the sun is quite bright."
3149,"Thank god for the great view on their deck! Or else, this would have been my first 1 star. Simply put, very weird concept. The name makes you think seafood, New England fare, but was far from that. Almost everything was Asian fusion and from appetizer to entree every dish was neon green/yellow. Was very off putting, probably misuse of turmeric.  Mussels were way too sweet with only one flavor profile. Asian Ceaser salad was unique to say the least, chicken was very thin and over cooked. Soups were the worst, felt like they were experimiting with us. Regretted eating here right when we say down....win some, lose some."
3150,"If I could leave no stars I would.  We came for lunch and were seated next to the host stand/order input station.  When we arrived they had a good crowd but nothing overwhelming.  It took 25 minutes for us to get water and then order.  Our waitress didn't enter our order into their system for 10 minutes (we were seated next to their station).  They were kind enough to bring a coloring book and crayons for my daughter and this thankfully kept her occupied while the rest of us waited and waited.  It took over 35 minutes to bring out 5 salads and 2 fish and chips.  My Caesar salad had so little dressing on it that I thought there wasn't any.  My cousins house salad came out with warm greens (not crisp) with some wilted lettuce in it.  Overall the food was poor (with the exception of the shrimp included in my salad) with non-existent service.  Would we have ordered a second drink, absolutely had the waitress ever come by.  As we were getting ready to leave we heard them reply to a customers question that yes, they did have a kids menu (why should a customer even need to ask).  I paid for two $20 salads and a $17 fish and chips for my 9, 10, and 11 year olds instead of ordering them something off of a kids menu.  This place was a ripoff from the get go which only cares about your money and nothing else.  The high light of the whole experience was the quick check and exit.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."
3151,"Great little seaside shack type restaurant. Good service, good food, and the view from the deck was worth the short 20-30 minute wait. Check this place out if you're ever on Peaks Island!"
3152,"Great food!  I had the burger with onion rings and kimchi, soooo delicious!  The seasoned, coated fries were a perfect side too.  Great atmosphere, view of Casco Bay, and the option of indoor or outdoor dining.  Great lunch spot!"
3153,"Very mediocre. 

The restaurant itself is pretty dingy. We sat on the back deck at a sticky table where we spent half the meal swatting at flies. Can't beat the view though. 

Service was fast. Server didn't waste time with small talk. She was great. 

Food was good. Nothing spectacular. I got the lobster roll and fries. Not a beautiful presentation but it's a hard dish to mess up. My boyfriend got the seafood chowder. Being from California he loved it but his standards are much lower than mine. He also got fish and chips with the ""house sauce"" which was the best part of the meal. I normally hate tartar sauce but was pretty much licking the plate. 

I would come back if I were hungry enough. 

(Bonus points for the fact that they write ""lobster"" instead of ""lobstah"" and ""chowder"" instead of ""chowdah."" That drives me nuts.)"
3154,"The owner and manager (mother and son) were both incredibly rude and unprofessional. Party of 9, one person didn't like her meal. Asked for a side of FF instead. Took nearly 20 minutes for FF. Charged for the uneaten food and the FF. Very rude when confronted about this.  He told us to pay the bill (our money was already out) the and leave or he would call the police on us and they would make make us leave.  He even pretended to call. When talking to locals about our experience we were told that these owners are known for being crazy and rude."
3155,"My husband and I stopped by about two weeks ago while visiting Peaks Island.  We read decent reviews online and it seemed like a cute little place to get lunch.  Well....when we arrived around noon, we were greeted by the host who told us it would be a long wait.  The restaurant was crowded, so we asked about how long the wait would be.  He told us he didn't know the wait time because the kitchen staff was behind on the orders of customers already seated.  Since they were ""inundated"" with customers, they shut down the kitchen to give those staff a break!!!  Additionally, he said (gruffly) it would take at least 40 minutes to then get seated once they were up and running again.  This was totally unacceptable!!

Despite having a long wait for the ferry, we left.  On the way out, a gentleman ""taking a breather"" outside mentioned that he had to wait 25 minutes, after he was seated, just for a drink.  He also placed his order before learning the kitchen shut down.  After hearing this, I was super glad we decided to leave.  We found a nice place for lunch a little ways down the road."
3156,Worth the trip over to Peaks Island just to eat and drink here. Special of prosciutto  wrapped scallops was a home run. Clam chowder and fresh sourdough were perfect comps. Highly recommended!
3157,"Stopped in for lunch.  Horribly slow service, which we could live with, but the overall quality/price of food was poor/expensive. $29 for a TINY lobster roll!  Really?  The lobsters were caught 10 feet from here.   just not worth it.  Should have waited to be back in Portland."
3158,"Great view of the bay, other than that, food was mediocre. The server ignored us for a long periods of time, nine dollar glass of house Pinot ?
Wow, the inside is crowded the deck area is nice
Come here for views not food."
3159,"The best place for lunch on the island. Fresh, hot, fast seafood. Light and well-prepared, with Asian and Thai overtones. On a nice day, the deck overlooking Casco Bay is magical. The staff were eager and professional."
3160,"Had a great lunch on the deck, curried chowder and PEI mussels which were awesome!! Nice local place with good draft beer"
3161,"Great service, great food and food presented very well.  Service was fast and friendly.  If you go, make sure you go for dinner to enjoy the sun setting over Portland."
3162,The best restaurant on Peaks Island. Asian / Maine fusion in a casual setting. Friendly service and expertly prepared food. Great sunset views of Portland and Casco Bay.
3163,"Don't be fooled by the silly name and the cartoon sign. From the cocktails to the seafood pasta to the pulled-pork bahn mi to the pumpkin cheesecake, this place knows what it's doing! And our server, Marlene, was a true delight--charming, funny, and efficient. Can't wait to go back."
3164,"Came to this restaurant after arriving in Peaks Island after 6pm, when many of the other restaurants/diners/food trucks on the island were already closed. To be honest, I wished that I had walked around a little more to explore my options rather than go into the first open restaurant that I saw. 

Our waiter didn't seem to know too much about the food that he was serving... and it seemed like he cared a lot more about the other tables that he was serving and blatantly ignored our table. I think that tables are supposed to receive a plate of bread rolls & butter before their entree, and while he gave bread to the tables all around us, he never even offered to give us bread. It was pretty disappointing to see a waiter blatantly treating two parties differently. We were also served our entree before our water even came, which is pretty unacceptable at a restaurant.

In terms of the actual food, the clam chowder was pretty tasty. However, the bowls are very, very wide, so the amount of chowder that you think you get is drastically different from the amount that you actually get once you start eating. We also had the Sesame Encrusted Salmon with Wasabi Aioli... and I would recommend to stray away from this dish unless you are a big fan of wasabi.

The only super positive part about this meal was the view out the back deck, which was beautiful since you can see straight out towards the Portland skyline.

Ultimately, I would recommend that you arrive in Peaks a little earlier so that you can get a taste of the other, much more affordable options at the other dining locations (or maybe even bring your own food for a picnic...) Nothing too special at this restaurant."
3165,"My husband and I came to Portland for the weekend with some friends.  Everyone that we met, told us to take the Ferry over and venture out to Peaks Island.  So we did, we got to the island, and rented a golf cart, which I would totally recommend! It was so much fun.  We took about a half hour drive around the island, taking in the scenery and taking some pictures.  After about 45 minutes or so, we came across Cockeyed Gull, and decided to stop in.  We order a few beers and just relaxed for a little bit.  After about a half hour or so, there was some commotion at the bar.  A server came up to the bartender and asked if that couple that was sitting at the end of the bar paid there tab. The bartender said no, therefore, the server went outside to find them.  The gentleman came back and told the bartender that he did pay, he paid $20 for two beers, and was never given his change.  The bartender, changed his story about 339759 times.  At first he said he didnt pay, then he said he did, then he said that he couldn't remember, then he said that he left which is why he didn't get him change. It was bizarre. The bartender started getting a little short tempered and nasty so the patron walked out.  A few moments later, the wife comes in, and starts asking questions.  She was very nice, and simply asked how much each beer was, and why they didn't get change.  The bartender started getting nasty again, and actually raised his voice with her.  He said ""I don't care what you think, please get out of my establishment!"" How rude!!! You do not speak to a woman that way, actually, you shouldn't speak to anyone that way! How unprofessional.  My friends and I didn't like that at all, so we asked for our check.  As we were squaring away our bill, the man siting next to me, said, ""Don't forget your change"", we looked at him and said that's not ours.  The bartender put the couples change in the wrong spot! Rather than giving it back to them, he put it closer to us! So they did pay, and he did back the change, but rather than try and make things right, he raised his voice and got nasty with his customers! Learn some management skills bud! Oh and please stop wiping sweat off your face with a sweat rag and then cutting the lemons and limes that will eventually end up in your costumers drinks, without washing your hands.  How is this place still open? Worst part, this bartender is the owner!!! 
 
Do yourselves a favor, skip this place and head down the street to The Inn on Peaks Island! Friendly service and much cleaner!"
3166,"Had a great dinner there with 3 others.  Everything was delicious and deck views of the sunset were stunning.  One fly in the ointment... My credit card number was phished there.  Found out the next day when the credit card company called to inquire with concerns.  Card was double billed for our dinner (and there were disturbing charges suddenly popping up in Florida).

So, good food, great view, and pay with cash."
3167,"My husband and I stopped here for a drink and an appetizer while we killed some time waiting for the ferry. We sat on the deck and enjoyed the gorgeous view while we waited for our server. It's a good thing the view was so beautiful because we waited quite a while for a server to come to our table. Not a big deal, we weren't in a rush, but when three tables are seated after yours and are waited on first, it gets a little annoying. Our server did apologize when he finally greeted us and we ordered a beer, seltzer and the hummus plate. Both the drinks and the food took an incredibly long time to arrive and our server continued to be apologetic, muttering something about problems in the kitchen. In the end, we got our food and drinks and all of this was fine. My husband and I both have worked in the service industry so we tend to be sympathetic toward servers who usually are doing their very best. Our server was young and polite, just inexperienced at his job. 

Now, the only reason I am even writing this review is because of what came next. We paid our bill and went to the beach to wait for the ferry. As we were walking toward the dock we were stopped by the police and asked if we had just ate the the Cockeyed Gull. We said yes. And she proceeded to tell us that the restaurant said we walked out on our bill. Ummmmm, no?
She seems to believe us but asks that we go back to the restaurant to see what happened. Now, the ferry is pulling into the dock and we have to run up to the restaurant to solve this problem. We arrive and our server is standing at the door. We question him and he tells us he had just misplaced the receipt, sorry! I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  You took our debit card, returned the receipt, and said have a nice day. How do you forget these things? And you immediately decide to fetch the police over our twenty something dollar tab? Please stop waiting tables and try something else. 
Also, that hummus plate was bullshit for 9.50."
3168,"Not a good experience today,first to arrive and they said they only had enough for 2 people to have the special which were fried clams. Really you just opened and you are already out of the daily special.And when it arrived the portion was so sad,we counted 6 clams on a bed of French fries for 15 dollars. The only reason I'm giving a star is because the view is beautiful. Sorry ,but i can't let this one slide."
3169,Friendly staff. View of the water. Good for a refuel before checking out the rest of the island.
3170,"The restaurant has a beautiful view of downtown Portland and Casco bay.   It is one of only a handful of restaurants on Peaks Island.   The menu options were rather limited.   I had a caesar salad, which was very good, and the New York steak which was a bit overcooked and tough.   My dining companion had the chicken stir-fry and was less than impressed.  Accept the fact that if staying on Peaks Island you'll probably come here more than once."
3171,"Beautiful view on the back deck. Food is decent, nothing special. Drink prices are reasonable as well. Also, note that they do turn off the fryer around 5."
3172,"The seafood selection and prices are pretty standard fare. The service was very friendly for us. The view is awesome, especially on the deck, and the place is small enough that most tables have a good view. Not many options on the island but this place is a good choice for a meal...plus the name rules."
3173,"This gem is well worth the 20 minute ferry ride from Portland.  We had lunch on their patio overlooking Portland Bay on July 2.  Waiters were friendly and helpful.  We had fried calamari that were tasty and not greasy, the house salad consisting of a large plate of fresh salad greens and vegetables, and a wonderful watermelon and feta cheese salad.- all good. Note that they stop serving lunch around 3:30."
3174,"Stopped by for lunch, food was decent. However we were not pleased with service of abrupt waitress. Maybe she was having a bad day, but we didn't appreciate her poor attitude.  Timing was off on service as well, when you order soup it should come before the main meal, not so in this case. Even though food was o.k. we would not go back again. A good view is  diminished  by indifferent  service. We are not fuss budgets, we are just looking for good food and cordial service."
3175,"Mixed performance. The food and view merited four stars - the wings were some of the best we've had, and the mussels in coconut curry cream were delicious. But the drinks and service were disappointing. Joe's dry martini didn't come with an olive or twist or offer of one (while leaving we noticed other diners with olives in theirs) and it was fairly warm upon arrival. My gin and tonic tasted like gin and club. When I asked, they fixed it (apparently the syrup in the fountain was out), but without much of an apology and the drink stayed on our tab. Most restaurants I've been to would have said it was on the house due to the mixup and time it took to fix. The clincher was when we came back later that night to try and get one last drink of the evening. It was about 20 mins before closing with patrons still at the bar. We asked if they could fit us in for one last drink. Waiter at the door looked at the bar and said, ""I don't know, I guess you can try."" No offer to speak to the bartender. His look was more like ""good luck, you're on your own."" We turned around and went to the place down the street, who were welcoming and hustled to get a drink AND app order in before close."
3176,"Although the place has great potential with its balcony overlooking Casco Bay, the food was some of the worst and most overpriced I've had in years.  The crab cake dinner was comprised of 2 tiny cakes which contained nothing identifiable by taste or sight other than breading.  The rest of the ""dinner"" was overcooked white rice and some extremely bland steamed squash.  Service was EXTREMELY slow and our server seemed unconcerned and generally kind of obnoxious.  With their location and the endless stream of tourists walking by their door, they realistically don't need to adhere to a doctrine of quality or service to attract customers.  But it's a crying shame that they've taken it so far to the opposite extreme."
3177,"Wow! What an unbelievable mess this restaurant is! We went here because it was the only place open and I can now see that is how they get most of their business: being open while other places are closed. The only reason to go here would be for a beer or a whiskey. AVOID THE FOOD BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.  The funny thing is, this place could be awesome if they just did maybe four food items well (is a lobster roll too much to ask for [?] ...we are in Maine after all...I don't even think there was any lobster on the menu at all), but they operate under a guise of semi-""upscale"" dining with outlandishly overpriced entrees when the food they put out is pretty much just flavorless slop. It's actually compelling in its badness. A good place to go if you want to stick to that diet!"
3178,"My friend and I decided to go to Peak's Island not knowing what was out there. We came across this restaurant and at first glance, we weren't sure what we were in for. Once walking in, there was a really nice deck off the back of the building overlooking the water. The food was really good (I recommend the Crab Cakes appetizer). The service was wonderful. It was $102 with tip for two people, so it isn't the cheapest but I would definitely return."
3179,"We arrived at the Cockeyed Gull ready to eat! We had a reservation, as the night before was busy and we couldn't get a table walking in. I'd highly recommend making a reservation for this restaurant. When we arrived, we ordered 6 waters. It took about 15 minutes for our waters to come out - foreshadowing the rest of the evening. Another 20 minutes for our drinks to come out, and about a good half hour passed until we got our appetizers. The restaurant was incredibly busy, but at no time did our waitress come and apologize or tell us things were running a bit slower than usual. One of my friends did not even receive the appetizer he ordered (the soup du jour). He actually ended up getting his soup AFTER his main course, and it was cold as well, and not very flavourful. The only saving grace this restaurant had was the amazing food. I had ordered the special of Lobster polenta, and the others at the table had the New York Strip steak (amazing), the special steak wrapped in prosciutto, and bacon (also amazing), with incredible fluffy potatoes. When we finished our meal, it took our waitress about 20 minutes to come and ask us if we wanted dessert or more drinks, and she did not even clear all the plates from our tables (we ate our main courses with the empty appetizer plate on the table still - we ordered the hummus - this was good, nothing crazy or special about it). 

All in all, the food was really good but the service really sucked. Two waitresses for this restaurant are not enough (not sure if thats only how many they have, but its how many were working and it clearly wasn't enough, as I noticed other tables were getting impatient and even some patrons ended up standing and looking for the waitress as she wasn't giving enough time to all her tables)."
3180,"The location and the view are fantastic and beautiful. However the food and the service are nothing to write home about. It is expensive and the amount of food is poor. We had the crabcakes, and we were highly disappointed as they were mostly fillings and not crabmeat"
3181,"I tried the fried Calamari with fries and it tasted okay.  Friends had smoked salmon and crabcake sandwich and thought it was okay also.  Our waiter was nice.  Maybe a bit too nice.  But overall, good view of the seaport and the food tasted average."
3182,We stopped in this little restaurant because it overlooks the water but was pleasantly surprised at the freshness and good taste of the food. The haddock sandwich was fresh and really hit the spot. The waiter also was very helpful and professional. I would highly recommend this place if one is visiting Peaks Island.
3183,"The deck offers a beautiful view, and the wait staff were very friendly and accommodating, but the food was seriously lacking. When you are asked to pay $27 for a steak, you expect more than a burnt slab of meat that more closely resembles and tastes like a hockey puck. We did find the carrot cake to be awesome, but a $5 piece of cake doesn't really make up for the overpriced and lackluster entrees. I would suggest enjoying a nice glass of wine on the deck patio simply for the view, but perhaps just stick with an appetizer or dessert."
3184,"We took a gamble on a Thursday night in February to celebrate my birthday.  We wanted to get out of town, but we didn't feel like driving, so we looked on Peak's and decided to give Cockeyed a gander.

After arriving we saw a few locals imbibing on Bloody Mary's at the small bar area.  The first impression was we found our way into Peak's version of Cheers.  Fortunately first impressions aren't always that accurate.

The loud and at times obnoxious patrons soon found their way out and we were left with an amazing dining experience.  The staff was courteous, engaging and friendly.  The food was mostly outstanding, the clam cakes were delicious, the steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce on the sausage penne was to die for.

After reading all the reviews here I was struck by one common theme: bad service.  We had an extremely welcoming experience, up to and including a great encounter with the chef who came out and chatted with us out of the blue.  She was very proud of her food and her restaurant and it showed.  At the end she even came to back to our table and gave us a few chocolate truffles as an impromptu birthday cake.

We will definitely come back here, especially as the weather warms up and we can sit on the deck.  The view was pretty good from our seat inside, but we could only imagine how nice it would be to be able to eat outside and have a full view of Casco Bay."
3185,Great view but the food was lacking. I came here with a party of 13 and at least half of us were dissatisfied with our meal. My NY strip steak was over cooked and lacked flavor. The clam chowder was overly creamy and also lacked flavor. Next time I'm trying the inn down the street.
3186,"Essentially you're paying for a beautiful view from the outdoor dock and decently priced beers. They had some Baxter Autumn Ale that I could chug like crazy if I was into that. I resisted, though, for our server would probably judge me (for good reason). 

Or maybe not. While she paid close attention to a lot of the tables surrounding my BF and I, our waitress seemed a bit inattentive when it came to our table (was it because of the giant touristy camera we were playing with?). Food was about as good as her service, too. My sesame salmon sandwich fell apart really easily within one bite, and BF's food was forgettable (seriously, I can't remember for the life of me what he ordered)."
3187,"Bad beer selection. No IPA? Grumpy server. The view is great, but i immediately felt uncomfortable like I didn't trust anything they were gonna put in front of me. So we decided to leave after a drink. We ordered the curry soup togo so we could catch the ferry back to better food options. Glad we did. The soup was really boring. It was curry coconut. How can that be boring? Its should have spice."
3188,"I'd say this place is pretty perfect for what it is.  The service was fine, the view was gorgeous, the atmosphere was bright and friendly, and the food was outstanding and fresh.

We both ordered the appetizer specials -- the butternut squash soup was perfectly spiced and creamy, and the green bean with feta and balsamic salad was super fresh and tasty.  My husband had the fried calamari and I had the crab cakes...so lotsa fried food, but I was totally surprised by how light everything was.  The calamari looked like it was fried in a tempura batter.  Yum.  

My only complaint is that they had just one beer on tap -- Hoegaarden.  I happen to like Hoegaarden, but was hoping to try a local brew like Shipyards or Allagash.  

Definitely stop by this place if you happen to venture out to this cute little island!"
3189,"I came in with a friend a couple of weeks ago. Cute place, we decided to sit outside and enjoy the lovely view.
 Since the 1/2 dozen oysters I ordered were so delicious, I was going to order more.Thankfully, I decided to check on the price first. They were $18.75 for 1/2 dozen!!! Are you kidding me? I realize that this  place deals with a lot of tourists but that is a rip off. J's Oyster charges $7.50.
I didn't complain at the time but I am mentioning it now.
I also felt that our server had an attitude. I am in the service industry and there is nothing worse than someone serving you who makes it feel like they are doing you a favor!!"
3190,"Stopped in for a quick lunch- drawn in by the view out back on the deck.
I let my server talk me into the lobster roll. BIG MISTAKE. What an incredible rip-off for $17.50. It had only claw meat, swimming - no, Drowning in watery mayo based dressing. Awful. The supposed side of caesar salad had too little dressing - a vinagrette that had nothing to do with caesar dressing, with a tiny bit of shredded tasteless cheese and croutons on top. 
I would only recommend coming here for a drink on the deck. I imagine that the Inn down the street has better food. Better yet, save your appetite for a 10 minute drive from Portland Waterfront to Two Lights Lobster Shack in Cape Elizabeth. For $12.99, their lobster roll is everything it should be, and the view can't be beat."
3191,"First time on peaks island, wanted a quick bite to eat. Beautiful view! I had the fish & chips and must say the best fish I've had in a long time, my companion had calamari and fries. Also delicious! Great service, amazing food!"
3192,"The back deck over looking Casco bay towards Portland is worth the Ferry ride over. We wanted a different view for a sunset with some appetizers. We were happy with the food, and we had friendly service."
3193,"Bring the Pepto, but Leave Your Children at Home! Upon returning from our trip to Maine, we compiled our thoughts on this horrific restaurant, and I found that my 15 year-old niece said it best. This is what she said: On a vacation with my aunt and uncle, we decided to grab some lunch at The Cockeyed Gull on Peaks Island. It was at least a 30 minute wait (even though we were told 15) before we could even sit down and order any food, and we were appalled to hear a same-sex couple be told that their wait was at least 45 minutes (maybe not everyone is welcome here). My uncle ordered a drink in that interval of time and had a seemingly pleasant conversation with the bartender. When we ordered our food, we found that the waitress was somewhat polite to us, but was incredibly rude to others. Finally, we finished our meals, my aunt staying behind to pay while my uncle and I left to rent a golf cart to drive around on the island. Unfortunately there weren't any available so we returned to the restaurant to inform my aunt of this. A guy, more than likely the manager, halted us, saying that they weren't seating anyone else (they were closing early for no apparent reason). Despite my uncle's calm explanation that my aunt was inside, the man impatiently told us that we couldn't go inside. We continued in anyways, and my uncle told the man to check himself, which resulted in the man's ranting. After informing my aunt that there were no golf carts, we ventured off to a bike rental shop. Outside the restaurant stood the bartender, so my uncle asked what the man's name was in order to write a proper review. Clearly, the bartender's politeness was a very false pretense because he defensively demanded an explanation for the inquiry, apparently getting an unsatisfactory answer; he exclaimed , ""Oh, you're one of those guys!"", then waved his middle finger in my uncle's face, yelling the corresponding words to the gesture. Later on in the day as we were riding bicycles, my aunt's stomach began to feel dreadful. My stomach began to feel awful as soon as I got on the ferry, my uncle's following in pursuit soon after we got off. Our churning stomachs caused us to have to take two Peptos, along with cancellations of subsequent plans. I would NEVER recommend this place, for it has terrible food, terrible service, and is utterly inappropriate for kids"
3194,"We really enjoyed the view from the deck and the shrimp appetizer that we ordered. However, the service was not good, as I believe we were judged for only wanting drinks and appetizers. We were seated with attitude. We were not told the appetizer specials, despite the next table with the same waitress being offered these (and they sounded delicious). When we received our food, we requested silverware/napkins that we didn't receive initially. We were provided with a paper napkin set that differed from all of the other guests who received fabric sets. Overall, I would only recommend for a full meal, as then you may receive appropriate service with good food."
3195,"How can you go wrong with a name like Cockeyed Gull!

Cool restaurant with deck that looks onto Casco Bay.  Nice thing is that deck is protected from wind so it was a beautiful location to have dinner. Small interior but deck is probably where most people want to sit anyways.

Our group had Seafood Chowder (pretty good but could be hotter temperature wise), Steak tips (tender, juicy, tasty), Steamed Mussels, Potato encrusted Haddock, Crab salad, Crab cakes, and the special lobster pasta in pink sauce (very good and very generous portion).

The owner was smoking a large chunk of brisket that smelled awesome, but it wasnt being served tonight so the lucky folks tomorrow will luck out."
3196,Wayyyyyyy too mediocre for the price.  Outside deck is fine--but you are better off getting pizza down the street and sitting on rocks by the water.  Overall a disappointment.
3197,"I came here for a late night breakfast, and wasn't very impressed.  Our server snapped at us when we took longer than 3 seconds to tell him our order.  

I asked for cheese on my eggs, and he said they couldn't do that.  ""Sir"" I replied, ""I'm willing to pay extra for it, whatever it costs"".   Mr. Snappy snaps back with a ""nope, we only have what you see on the menu, we cant make ANYTHING else.""  

I sat there with a dumbfounded look on my face... and I think I even re-iterated an astonished ""whatever it costs"" comment.   ""I'll come back when you actually know what you want, I don't have time to stand here"" he rudely snapped and walked off.  

It's not like the place didn't have cheese.  A-hole.  Maybe it's not his fault, it could be direct order from his boss... but still - COME ON!! it's cheese!!  Any type would have been fine!  You could have scrapped some cheese of an old pizza and given it to me, I would not have cared at that point.  

Food came out pretty quickly, but very skimpy.  1 piece of bread, and I think a total of 5 homefries.  

This restaurant comes across as they think they're the $hit and really good and fancy, when they are just plain horrible and need a metaphorical slap in the face.  

I almost gave the server a literal slap in the face, but I was in the company of ""islanders"" (long term residents) and they said they knew him.  

So I switched back to a subtle, no tip for you sir."
3198,"The food is ok!!! The service sucks, the servers are not attentive to your needs. We felt forsaken. We asked one server for water and she responded who is your server?
Very bad service!!!!"
3199,"Service was slow, impolite and rude.  Food was overpriced for what it was and make sure to ask about the price of their special.  Ours was double the price of anything else on the menu.  Would very much recommend finding other dinner accommodations."
3200,"Great food and view.  Fast and polite service.  Delicious rolls. Had the potato crusted haddock - perfectly cooked and delicious.  Everyone else's meal was great too (thai shrimp and crab cakes).  Nothing too fancy, just good solid food."
3201,"We stumbled into this unassuming place looking for some lunch.  What a delicious experience.  I had the shrimp mango salad and it was wonderful.  The freshest ingredients make all the difference.  Brian had the lobster roll and agreed, the freshness was the key to this delicious lunch.  I would say worth the ferry ride."
3202,"Although I would give it another chance, it was a disappointing experience.  The service was lacking, the mussels were barely edible by my standards (based on the texture, maybe they were from frozen?), and the chowder was merely passable."
3203,"this place is great! i had a scrumptious lobster bisque and my mom's crab cakes were light, crispy, and tasty. there is outdoor seating, but it is super cozy inside. i'm pretty sure this is one of only 2 restaurants on the entire island, so luckily it is fantastic."
3204,"Great great great! Great service, beautiful views and wonderful food! I had the hanger steak which was tender and had a wonderful flavor. My husband and I started with the crab cakes which were light and crispy full of crab meat not fillers. I would recommend it to anyone."
3205,"From a born and bred New Englander - this great place has all the charm of a waterside takeout complete with picnic tables.  We had a lobster roll and haddock plate that were fantastic.  Staff was friendly and prompt and laid back. 

This place was called Buddy's in another life but it's rebirth is heading"
3206,"I was really torn between 3 and 4 stars for this review.  The Clamdigger is a new business that has taken over for an old, sad seafood business, which had run out of the same spot for YEARS!  

The old place was really, really bad.  The food was old and questionable and the place was literally falling apart (moldy stairs and soft, wet wooden floors covered with smelly astroturf.  Ugh!

When I noticed that this was clearly a new place, with tons of lovely outdoor seating, I stopped in right away.

The new owner has clearly spent a LOT of time cleaning the place up and expanding the outdoor seating.  The menu also had many things I wanted to try.  

Unfortunately, we arrived after a ""rush"" and they were out of clam chowder, seafood chowder, shrimp (of any kind), and crabcakes, which caused us to go around in a few circles while trying to order.

Being the flexible people we are, we finally settled on a mixed seafood platter of haddock, clams and scallops.  We ordered one large to share for the two of us, and it was HUGE!!!  The seafood was plentiful and fresh and came with a whole bunch of fries and some really solid coleslaw.

The staff was friendly and we really enjoyed ourselves.  I am hoping that the cleaned out menu and some of the other concerns reviewers had are just a part of getting this new business up and running.  

I will definitely check the Clamdigger out again!"
3207,"We pulled into this nice, newly renovated, roadside clam shack with high hopes as there was no line and lots of empty tables...now I know why there were so many empty tables as the three stooges have come out of retirement to run this place. 

No clam chowder at 2pm in the middle of your busy season ? Nice planning Chef. We ordered fried clams and shrimp cocktail. They immediately cook the clams and let them sit on the back kitchen counter to get cold while they START to cook the shrimp cocktail to order ? News flash- shrimp cocktail is cooked ahead of time and kept chilled.

So I asked the snappy and very crabby cashier to give me the clams so that I could eat them hot and she barks ""I TOLD YOU IT WOULD BE 15 MINUTES""!

Well, I am not letting my clams sit on the counter for 15 minutes so she tosses them at me in a huff. First class hospitality here. Fried clams are the worst in Maine by the way.

15 minutes later, they call me up for my shrimp cocktail (which was for my daughter who watched us eat lunch without her) and the shrimp cocktail was WARM !! 

What ?? I asked for my money back and she loses her cool by telling me ""not to blame her for a poorly run kitchen"".

If you want to have a laugh, look at the Yelp Reviews of "" Benny's Famous Seafood"". Benny's is now closed but discovered the same people are now running the dreadful, mom and pop Clam Digger funny farm...keep driving folks."
3208,"Ran out of propane and expected customers to wait an hour. Wasn't honest about the problem - pretty scummy.

Half our party got their food and the other half couldn't order. First half didn't get refunded."
3209,"We ordered from your restaurant tonight and were so disappointed. We ordered haddock nuggets and chicken tenders. The fries in both meals were so mushy and undercooked they were not edible. There actually a few fries that were still frozen/cold. The chicken tenders, which are battered frozen grilled chicken strips were undercooked, cold and oddly flavored. They too were inedible. The portion of haddock was disappointingly small. Some portions of the fish were over cooked and tough and others the batter was undercooked. After spending 40$ on two meals that we could not eat we are feeling frustrated."
3210,"I was happy to see what looked like an old-school coastal lobster shack. Walk up counter, picnic tables and serving fried whole clams and lobster rolls. I can not recommend this to anyone looking for a good lobster roll...whether they are a local or tourist. I'm a native and perhaps because I know how easy it is to make a good lobster roll I'm really disappointed with this place. 
We ordered two cold lobster rolls (vs grilled???), and a half pint (the smallest order) of fried clams as well as one soft drink...it was $64 and change!!!! That wouldn't have been so bad if it was a great lobster roll.

The breakdown of the roll...The lobster meat was one claw and some cut up pieces of lobster...served naked on a piece of lettuce in a toasted bun, and a lemon wedge (what!) on the side. The roll was nicely buttered and toasted, the proper top split roll, but about twice the size...and nearly empty...really the pieces of lobster in this roll weren't even touching each other. I had to go back and ask for mayo. I took my plastic knife and scooted all the meat to one end. It filled about 1/4-1/3 of the roll. 

We really felt ripped off. And I don't like to give a bad review. I know it's hard to run a business, but this place isn't worth the trip. Shame on them. They have huge signs on both sides of the shack advertising their huge seafood portions??

The fried clams were mediocre. I saw some folks ordering fried platters, so maybe those are better? But definitely don't go for the lobster rolls and maybe not even the clams. I know I'm not going back. I wish I hadn't wasted that much money on a lousy lunch."
3211,"Clamdigger was A-OK!  Food is much better than whatever it was called before.  Lots of seating and cleaner too.

I will be back to the Clamdigger to try their other offerings.  Their batter was not the best but not the worst either."
3212,"Yummy! Very high on my list of best lobster rolls! The bun is outstanding - big thick brioche slice split in half with big pieces of claw meat. My husband had a fried clam roll with huge clams. Only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 is because of the noise on the road (which really comes with any roadside stand) and the fact that that they didn't have any steamers. However, there is a stand right next door with great prices on fresh steamers and lobsters to take home - so we grabbed a bag on the way out. 3lbs for $13.50. All in all a great experience for us as new locals, we will defiantly be back!"
3213,"The lobster roll was fresh, tender, buttery and generous serving. Best in the Portland area. Crab sandwich also equally good
 Owner said seafood delivered twice a day."
3214,"First time here - the fried clams were just ok, the batter was a little too thick for me - but for those that like a heavier batter the portion was generous."
3215,"I was a bit skeptical based on the inconsistent reviews so far, but the lobster roll was overflowing, fresh, and presented beautifully in a perfectly toasted bun. Onion rings were also very good, but not served hot. Nice staff aiming to please.  Dog friendly, easy parking, and comfortable with a welcome breeze across the water.  No seagulls eyeing your meal either!  Worth a try, especially if downtown parking is a problem on a crowded summer day."
3216,"I'm sorry to give such a poor review but it is honest and is a result of two meals from this re-named restaurant under new ownership. My first dinner there was fish and chips. The fish was deep fried in a very very heavy batter. There was way more batter than fish. That is unhealthy and unacceptable. Lots of french fries and onion rings, with coleslaw but that's not worth paying $18.95, when the main course is so unacceptable. My second meal two weeks later was a $24 lobster roll. Again, disappointing. Not enough lobster or high quality lobster meat to justify the price. That appears to be common with lobster rolls at other restaurants in the area. Lobster rolls should not be so expensive in Maine where the industry is right there and enjoys record hauls. Based on these two dinners, I will not return to the Clam Digger."
3217,"Without question, this place has the Best Fried Clams and unbelievably huge seafood platters. All fresh and exceptional. The lobster roll is fantastic! Friendly staff and a great location outside of Portland crowds. Highly recommended."
3218,"Fresh, just perfectly cooked delicious seafood! Staff was friendly and very helpful. I will most certainly be back when I visit Portland again!"
3219,"This place was the worst place I have been to in a long time, burger was raw they forgot about some of my parties meals , I will definitely never be back."
3220,The food at clamdigger was excellent more important the service provided by Christie was absolutely phenomenal five stars all the way!
3221,"My wife and I stopped by on our way from the airport to my parent's house on September 7, 2018.  I grew up in Cape Elizabeth and ate here a number of times under the previous management.  What an improvement!  The place has been cleaned up and the lobster rolls were a delight! Extra large brioche buns stuffed with a generous amount of lobster.  The cashier and the cook were both friendly.  The only upgrades I would recommend are to serve the beer and wine advertised on the menu, and build a restroom.  In a town with sky high lobster roll prices, this was a great value!"
3222,Been traveling to Portland for years and I love checking out the food scene. Lunch at the Clamdigger was very disappointing. The overpriced lobster roll was more roll then lobster and the clam chowder was missing the clams. There are much better options available in town.
3223,Was very disappointed.  Paid $28 for a lobster roll and fries.  Lobster was rubbery and bland and the fries had no taste to them.  The lobster was also chopped up into small pieces (not my preference) and the huge roll was rather greasy (looked like it was basted with too much butter).  What a total waste!
3224,"Our favorite lobster roll/lobster club/burger stop while in Maine. Delicious, tender, fresh and enormous servings. Not only did the seafood eaters in our party leave happy and satisfied so did the non seafood eater and kids. Service was likewise spectacular, friendly and prompt. Will now be a stop on our trips to Maine. The best!!!"
3225,"Great variety in the menu coupled with generous portions. Lobster roll was a cut above, and the haddock sandwich was big enough to become a knife-and-fork meal. Family friendly - my daughter ordered a lobster in the shell and they wrote it up as a kid's meal, probably selling it for less than full value. The owner went out and purchased kid-friendly lobster tools when she asked for something to crack the shell (it was a hard-shell lobster, easily 2+ pounds). The lobster seemed a bit underdone, but nothing that overly concerned me."
3226,What a great experience! I was born and raised in New England and have yet to find a place with such great food and a relaxing outdoor atmosphere. The girls at the counter were very knowledgeable with the menu and recommended the Clam Digger Platter. The portions are HUGE and everything tastes amazing! My Grandmother had a lobster roll and says its the best shes ever had!
3227,We love the Tom yum noodle soup and Pad Thai - we order them regularly. Great takeout and fast!
3228,"Scarborough has come up nothing, but excellent when it comes to cuisine. However... Jojo's disappointed. I ordered from the lunch menu. They do not have specials, but lunch portions. I tried the Basil Chicken with Rice & ordered the Tom Yum Soup. 

This was not the Pad Krapow Gai I expected. Usually, Thai Basil Chicken is spicy, very tasteful, the basil overpowers the chicken, yet somehow complements it all at the same time. The rice ties it in together and it all just melts beautifully when ingested. Instead, I literally had a chicken stir fry, with basically 2 basil leaves. To replace the copious amounts of basil, bell peppers and onions took its place.

The Tom Yum was not what I am used to either. Instead of testing like a hot & sour soup, it tasted like just hot soup..."
3229,"I just had the best bowl of Tom kha I have ever had. It was creamy and the chicken was so tender, not dry at all. I also got the mango curry. The chicken was just as good as in the soup and the mango was so sweet and fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone! It is delectable!!"
3230,"Was up for Thai and decided to try near by. Ordered the fresh rolls, then for me Tom Kha with shrimp, and Panang with beef. My mother orderd the Tom Yum with shrimp and Drunken noodles with beef. Knowing my mother, I'd be eating half of her order too.
Yep, so the rolls come out and she's not interested ""that would fill me up"" (somehow fried rolls are non-filling though as those were suggested as a better alternative). Any way they were held together tightly, and without the shrimp; still tasty for just carrot, cucumber, rice vermicelli and a minty herb whose name escapes me. The dipping sauce was a typical thin sweet chili mix with crushed peanuts floating atop. Not particularly spectacular or notable, nor bad. I probably would have preferred something more like a peanut satay or hoisin sauce with sriracha.
Both soups were very good. Companion ordered the Tom Yum but after a couple spoons we swapped so I had the TY. No need to fill up on water. Shrimp is with tail on. 
I had the Panang with beef. I'll stipulate It was very good as a curry (like a red curry).  But expecting Panang, it wasn't a Panang I'm used used to... thick and more intense flavor. So yeah, very good red curry But not Panang.
I didn't get to try the drunken noodles, but will get them as leftovers. I have no doubt they'll be good. My companion was pleased with them.
Was full after that so no room for any dessert - also forgot to see what they offered.
Honestly, despite the Panang, but because it was still a good curry, They are at least a low to med 4. And I'll round up. They are friendly and priced well too."
3231,"Have never dined in, but the chicken pad see yew I ordered for takeout was full of flavor, not too greasy, and came out FAST. Literally ready in 5 minutes. Yes, the price is slightly higher than some of the other Thai restaurants in the area (a few dollars more per dish), but food is delicious!"
3232,"Great Thai food without the hassle of traffic and parking.  Duck pad seew was delicious, as was the crab fried rice. Krapow Kai Raidow is a minced chicken with an egg on topp. Very yummy dish. Works for me."
3233,"Stopped in for lunch by chance as our original plan had a long wait...so glad they did!  From the moment we sat down our server was friendly, kind and hospitable.  In the end we found out he was in town from Florida helping the owner who had had a family emergency.  Our food came out quick, portions were very generous and the taste was wonderful!  We will be back!!"
3234,"Appetizers were good, portions good for price. Soup also was very good. Entrees were frankly horrendous. (Stay far, far away from the ""creamy peanut"" sauce). I possibly would give this place another try based on the strength of the appetizers and others' reviews, but I did not enjoy my meal at all."
3235,This place is the real deal. Great drunken noodles and northern beef curry dish. Really hit spices right on both dishes. Will definitely return.
3236,Was disappointed in the Pad Thai. Chicken was extremely dry and the veggies were undercooked and tasted odd. Cute place though and friendly staff!
3237,"I would first like to say that this is a very solid Thai restaurant, especially for maine. Jojo's has a very high rating, an attribute which I suspect is due to the fact that the reviews are written mainly by locals. I, however, live most of the year outside of Boston and thus have access to a wider range of restaurants with ranging qualities of food. I don't think Jojo's would earn a 4.5 star rating if it was near a city, but it provides solid takeout to an underserved area. I would go back, but don't expect the most incredible Thai food."
3238,"Since my last review I have ordered take-out which was delicious. Today I met a friend for lunch and it was terrific! I ordered the Pad See Ew and it was SO GOOD, plus it was only $8 before tip! My friend had the pineapple fried rice and also loved it. Service was friendly and speedy. There's plenty of parking, too!"
3239,"I took a friend for dinner last night to ''tis restaurant. We had Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp, Crab Rangoon,Shrimp Pad Thai, as well as Chicken Pad Thai. The food was timely and piping hot! We savored the flavors and couldn't stop complimenting how delicious everything was! Just enough heat , tang, and sweetness in both pad Thai dishes. The price point on the food and service were very reasonable.
Jojo and his wife Rungrawee are a dynamic team pouring their Thai influences and love into their food. Their infectious smiles make this place a #1 eatery in Southern Maine.
Thank you both for a lovely dinner and chat"
3240,"The food was good, albeit a bit bland. There was plenty of fiery spiciness, but not much else in the way of flavor. The sauce in my entree tasted mostly like oil and chili pepper. The savory/sour/sweet flavors were notably absent. Service was good and the restaurant was clean, but the atmosphere was not enjoyable: they had the same song playing on a continuous loop, over and over and over again. That song must've played at least 15 times while I was there."
3241,I've never had thai before until I ordered here! I ordered take out and they had the food ready in less than 15 minutes. It was amazing! The curry is really good .. like super good
3242,"Food was really good.  I had the duck which was crispy and delicious.
I would definitely eat here again."
3243,"Went for an early dinner, the dining room only had one other table with dinners, the phone was ring for take outs. Ordered soup to start, Tom Kha the broth was tasty the shrimp, all 3 were over cooked and they add mushrooms that were raw.The Tom Yum was about the same nice broth chicken that looked like it had been cooked a few days before and raw veggies.We ordered a curry, the sauce was good, very little chicken also precooked and raw veggies. Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. will not eat there again"
3244,"I go here at least once a week, and the food is always incredible. The owners are super nice. I've never had a bad meal here."
3245,"I get takeout from here whenever I'm home! The pad Thai and pad see ew are my favorites! You get huge portions that you can save as leftovers for the next day. Overall, the food is good but it's not anything spectacular"
3246,"We get takeout from Jojo's about once a month and it never disappoints. I should be more adventurous, but I just always get drunken noodles because they are so delicious. Scarborough is lucky to have Jojo's. I think it's the tastiest food around!"
3247,"Authentic food, speedy and kind service. Will definitely come back. Pad Thai was very good."
3248,"I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about Jojo's Thai Kitchen. I would eat here multiple times a week if I've could. I've dined in and also done a ton of takeout. Each time my food has been delicious, always consistent and the service is top notch. They have the best crab rangoons i've had in years as I hate the ones that are overloaded with too much cream cheese and not enough crab. The Pad Woon Sen with Tofu is my favorite dish. I recommend it to everyone I know! ALWAYS a happy customer!"
3249,food was decent. ordered the fresh rolls with shrimp and the Spicy fried rice. I asked for no carrots or peppers in the Spicy fried rice but they were not taken out. also no to go silverware was included in my to go order. not a deal breaker. not sure if i will be back.
3250,"The spice level is consistent, food is delicious, and the staff is friendly.  Would recommend if you are looking for good Thai food in the area!"
3251,I wish they served alcohol but luckily i had some in my car :).  Great family business and awesome food
3252,"Strong choice. I've been here at least six times and every time was a winner. Eat in, take out. Always great. Pad Thai. Very good. Rotating specials always a surprise. Unique offering like the wild boar basil. I had to do it. Very pleased. Crab Rangoon, while probably not Thai, still very good."
3253,"Really well done! Had drunken noodles one night and the wok hei was present but could have been stronger for me. I love that. 

Tonight won me over. Ordered Tom Yum and the broth was really spot on and had that delicious tangy, tart spice! Also ordered Yum Nua and forgot to make sure to ask for traditionally spicy -- it was perfect! Good balance of heat, sweet and sour and everything! Very good crunchy salad under the well spiced beef. When I close up my shop down the street I'll order here again!"
3254,"What a hidden gem!  We were up in Maine to celebrate our daughter's birthday, and she decided she wanted Thai food.  A quick Yelp search revealed Jojo's, only a few minutes from her house. I am so glad we came here.
1) We ordered two appetizers, the Vietnamese rolls and chicken satay.  Both were delicious, but the rolls were especially good.  Packed with meat and fried, there was plenty to go around for our table of four.
2) We ordered spicy fried rice with pork, chicken prikh king, tamarind salmon, and a special, chicken kai ka prow.  Everything was fresh and perfectly spiced/sauced.  The spiciest of the dishes was the prikh king.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly.
3) The menu is very accessible.  My daughter's boyfriend was nervous about ordering as he had never had Thai cuisine.  Everything on the menu is clear, including lists of the vegetables and the types of sauce (ex: soy-ginger sauce) are clearly described.  This is great for those unfamiliar with the items.
4) The place is BYOB.  I was hoping for a fun cocktail, but now I know to bring my own next time.
5) The staff is incredibly friendly and competent.  Dishes were cleared in a timely manner, questions were answered knowledgeably, and the owner even stopped by.  It was clear our business was appreciated.

I will definitely return to this restaurant the next time I am in the Scarborough area.  It may be the best Thai food I've ever had."
3255,"Jojo's Thai Kitchen is my FAVORITE Thai food in Maine! The food is delicious and homemade, and the staff is friendly and helpful. 

My favorite dish is the house special ground chicken (someone else posted a picture of it)! I dream about this dish and could eat it all the time. 

I 100% recommend Jojo's and have zero complaints! I've ordered here twice in the past week."
3256,Delicious chicken pad Thai & super friendly staff! Our new go to Thai restaurant since moving to Scarborough.
3257,"I have visited JoJos at least 20x since they have opened.

Every dish is fresh and delicious, and they always have the perfect spice level for me.

I am particularly fond of their drunken noodle. It is the best I have had.

Also wonderful service and owners."
3258,"I have only ever liked one Thai restaurant more than I have liked this one. If you are looking for Thai food in the Southern Maine area, you should take a trip here. I have been very disappointed lately with trying new Thai restaurant places, but Jojo's doesn't disappoint. The staff is friendly, the environment is clean, the food is great."
3259,A very nice evening!  We had wonton soup which was fresh and delicious.  I had pineapple fried rice with chicken and cashews.  A great combo!  My husband had ginger chicken which he enjoyed.  We brought our own beer and wine so the bill was very reasonable.  We will be back!
3260,"I love this place , food fantastic and nice service i been here many times me and my husband , we've got a cool time here we love theirs food and service.Jojo's staff so wonderful.I just wanna recommend Kapao and Viet roll the taste delicious love them'em all"
3261,"I tried out Jojo's before an evening event I was attending in the area. The service was incredibly fast and my curry was exceptional. Perfectly sweet and spicy.  The prices were very fair and their specials looked like a bargain. I didn't try any this time around, but I'll be back!"
3262,Pad Thai was tasty and the orange chicken was light with veggies that were NOT overcooked. Will definitely be going back.
3263,The duck with drunken noodles was delicious. The duck was breaded and fried and was served heaped in a sizeable portion over the noodles. Did not appear to have a liquor license but the thai tea was good. Very clean and nice decor.
3264,"02/25/17

friendly staff

authentic Thai food that tastes good

I will be going back"
3265,Three friends here for lunch were all very happy with their meals. Green curry with crispy duck was spectacular. And vegetable noodle soup divine and visually beautiful. To top it all off our server was so very nice and attentive. Thank you Jojo's!!
3266,So happy to have a great Thai place on Route 1. The food is delicious and consistent. I've been four times so far. Another reviewer mentioned that Jojo's does spice well. I agree. I'm usually a 2-3 star eater and my tongue was pleasantly warmed! The staff is kind and efficient. I've done take out and eat-in. Both are seemless. Parking has always been plentiful. The prices are less than others in the area and the serving sizes are equal. Thrilled to have them.
3267,"Excellent - tried the spicy fish. WHOA - asked for extra heat and they totally delivered. The dish included a huge amount of fish, cooked light and crispy with a delightful sauce of colorful bell peppers and onion. Glad I stopped in to try this new restaurant. Will plan to visit JoJo's Thai Kitchen in Scarborough and would encourage you to give them a try as well. New, clean spot with dine in and takeout offerings on their scrumptious menu. Starters are priced at $5-$7, entrees run $11-$16...noodles, rice dishes, curries, and a handful of chef specials as well."
3268,"Some of the best drunkin' noodles I've ever had!  Pairing this dish with crispy duck & a Thai ice tea is a must!  

Decor is simple, clean & quaint. We also found out that you have the option to bring in your own beer or bottle of wine!  Jo Jo and his wife are the sweetest.  We have definitely made this our ""go to"" Thai place.  So happy we found you!"
3269,"Sweet little place with very friendly staff. Really classy looking inside and out. Service was fast. So easy to begin to critique Thai restaurants based on the crab Rangoon appetizers - everyone does them so comparisons are a good touch point. JoJo's rangoons were excellent - hot, crispy and not greasy, heavy or soggy. Although my daughter's chicken pad Thai could have been more flavorful and the noodles a little less done, my chicken satay salad was really delicious, especially the coconut peanut sauce. Not too heavy, not too light and just the thing for a late supper. I hope I have the opportunity to return!"
3270,I had the Tom Yum soup with noodles and it was delicious! My daughter had the Tom Kah soup that had so much flavor it was great!
3271,Delicious! I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken and my husband had Rad Na with beef. Both were very tasty. Will definitely eat here again.
3272,"Very tasty authentic lunch. I am used to a little more heat in a spicy dish but overall everything was fresh, well prepared, and well presented."
3273,"The best take-out Thai I have had in Maine. My husband drives 30 minutes one way about twice a week for Jojo's. The people are incredibly friendly. The food is not greasy and the veggies are super fresh. I greatly appreciate that there is not even a trace odor or taste of fish sauce (if they even use it). I like that when you order ""vegetable"" instead of a meat, you get additional different veggies, not the standard carrots, beans, and onions but they throw in broccoli, green and red bell peppers, baby corn, zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms. It's fantastic. They can also make some of the dishes gluten free upon request (I only wish they could place an asterisk next to the dishes that can be made gluten free).

I normally order the Prik Khing with vegetable and the chicken satay appetizer (the largest satay app I have ever received!!). The chicken is so tender and delicious. Once, we skipped the satay and just ordered entrees with chicken - that chicken was overcooked, so we stick with the satay app and order entrees with veggies. The sauce on the Prik Khing is amazing and they get the heat just right. I LOVE spice, so four-star heat is my preference. My husband normally orders three-star heat and he thinks Jojo's is a little too spicy, so I recommend ordering a star down for first-timers. Also, the fresh rolls and gyoza are great appetizers, as well as the pad see ew noodle entree which we normally order when we do take-out to split for lunch the next day. So, in essence, we eat Jojo's four times a week. Also, the pancakes are quite flavorless but the accompanying sauce is good,, I wish there was more.

My only real complaint is that they don't have brown rice, but I usually make brown rice at home while my husband picks up the food."
3274,Service with a smile! The food is excellent. My family of picky eaters loves this place. The fried rices are delicious as are lo means!  Green curry is my favorite a close second is the drunken noodles with chicken  mmmm
3275,"A good quick little thai take out place. Prices could be a little cheaper. The food is mediocre, but compared to greasy Chinese this takes preference. The best part about this place is how close it is to my house. The people who run it are very friendly. I eat here at least twice a week. So no complaints for what it's worth. It beats pom's thai hands down, but that's not saying much."
3276,"Have eaten in once and ordered take out several times and the food is always good.  The spring roll appetizer, Green and yellow curries, Pad Thai are our favorites so far. Good sized portions and they don't skimp on the veggies in their dishes like other restaurants do. Restaurant is small and casual with friendly staff. Best Thai food in Scarborough/Portland area. Prices are between $11-13 per dish mostly and lunch prices much less- good value."
3277,I was traveling to Portland and decided to try this restaurant in Scarborough instead of heading into Portland.   I was pleasantly surprised.  The accommodations were excellent and the food was cooked very well.  The menu was plentiful to choose from and I was pleased that I tried this Thai restaurant.
3278,We have visited here several times since moving to Scarborough. The food is always very good and consistent and the owners are very nice people! My only tip is that if you like spicy Thai food be sure to ask them to make it extra spicy!!
3279,My husband and I have eaten here a few times and every time the food has been very good.  There are a lot of Thai restaurants but few good ones.  This is one of the good ones.  A plus is the owner and staff are very friendly.  This is now our new place to go for Thai food in the Portland area.
3280,"Great atmosphere.
Ale the owner in the kitchen.
Fun bar.
Efficient service.
All good."
3281,"I ordered the fried clams to go. I wanted my fries extra crispy. Everything was cooked perfect and was super delicious! Came with bread, which was very, very good-warm and perfect texture, not dry. Also came with coleslaw, which was very fresh and seasoned great. Portion size was generous. I didn't stay to eat but looked around while I waited. I've been in there before but not for a while, and the decor had changed for the better. Original artwork at the booths and creative repurposed hanging lamps at the booths as well. Looks nice. The hostess was a sweetheart. Definitely will visit again!"
3282,"This place was pretty good! Nice staff, nice decor. We had the fried haddock sandwich, haddock chowder, and a salad. The salad was just okay but seafood was incredible! Very fresh fish! The wine and beer list was just okay."
3283,"I stumbled into Bridgeway on a chilly evening for an early dinner. The place was deserted at 4:30, but by 5 the bar was packed. I happened to be the youngest person in there by about 40 years. The ambiance is a bit depressing, but the menu is reasonably priced for large portions of standard fare, seafood and sandwiches. My one complaint about the food (I had the haddock chowder and the calamari caesar) was underseasoning, but it's to be expected at a place that caters to the early-bird crowd, I suppose. My big issue was the service. My waitress had a horrible attitude and had the distinct impression that she hated her job, and possibly her life. After I had finished my soup she came over with some bread and butter and flippantly remarked that she should have brought it sooner. No big deal, I laughed it off. But as soon as she set down my entree she promptly forgot about me. Literally. Luckily I had a book with me, but 20 minutes after finishing my salad she was still no where to be seen. Finally I got up in search of the bathroom and when I returned she eventually came over with the check, revealing that she had in fact forgotten about me because I was ""so quiet."" I'm sitting there reading a book, I am not a ghost! Granted, the room did fill up a bit during the course of my meal, but really?! Needless to say, I will not be going back."
3284,"When they used to serve fresh fish, this was a good deep fried fish joint. They charge far more than that type of restuarant though, and on most recent visits the fish, clams etc. have been off, and yet more expensive. Service is always sketchy, which can be charming if you have time to kill. Total dive in atmosphere, but it really is a bar in restaurant clothing: it has a regular crowd liking the bar more than the food, and who can blame them?"
3285,"Scallops. Haddock chowder. Burgers. These are three of my favorite things at the Bridgeway, a local institution of great food. Comfortable, casual, easy, friendly, and very reasonable, but most important, DELICIOUS food."
3286,"Excellent. I cannot imagine how anyone who likes Thai food would give this restaurant anything but five stars. The food is spectacular, the service could not be better, and the restaurant is so clean that every time I go there it literally looks like it was painted that day. It is without peers in southern Maine. I recommend pad prik king 3 stars, chicken.
A+++"
3287,"Having read the reviews on Yelp and heard things from people about this place, to say nothing of driving past it on a routine basis, we finally here. I brought home food one night and my husband and I agree... It's nothing to write Yelp about! The food was lackluster quality at best and I found it disappointing that so many others seem to find it so much better. Was this a bad night? Do other people have such significantly different tastes and I do and what they judge is quality? I don't know. But I'm willing to give them another chance just in case."
3288,"We had a delightful dinner here. The service was excellent, but more than that was the wonderful variety of sweet and sour flavors that tickled our taste buds.  

We ordered three appetizers, spring rolls, Ruby thai rolls, and crab rangoon. Each appetizer was full of unique flavors that brought perfection to our pallette and joy to our hearts.  My wife said this was the best crab ragoon she ever had. 

I had the  won ton soup with pork and shrimp wontons, and fresh vegetabkes.  Even the carrots were thin sliced in a decorative pattern but were perfectly cooked, with a light crunch that was very satisfying.  We eat out often at our favorite chinese restaurant yet Ruby's wonton soup was far superior. 

Our main course was the simple pad thai with shrimp. My wife had the crispy Pad Thai while I rchose the more conservative regular noodle. If you cant get this dish right you are not a thai restaurant.  Well..they did it so wonderfully, the shrinp was fresh off the dock anf thry didnt skimp on the amount. Again the shrimp were perfectly cooked, not over cooked and the noodles were  prepared by a true expert-a passionate chef with an eye for perfection. 

We loved the food, the friemdly service but the music may have been a smidge too loud . Other than that small irritation, this was worthy of all 5 stars."
3289,"A pretty good Thai place. I've had better Thai food, but not in this hemisphere. Was empty Friday night,except for us, another family and (quite a few) takeout customers. 

Good crab Rangoon; very good duck and green curries; pretty good stir fry. This  being Portland, we were surprised Allagash beers weren't on the menu. Sam Adams was, however, so all was good. 

Recommended."
3290,"This review is for take-out only. The other night I tried Ruby Thai for the first time. I ordered pad thai, fresh spring rolls and crab rangoon to go.
When picking up the order I did notice a very sweet and comfortable looking dining room and plan to eat in a next time. 
I was extremely satisfied with the pad thai. The spring rolls were also particularly delicious with a little bit more green onion then others I've had and ground pork, which was a unique and tasty twist. 
One of the biggest surprises from the order though, where the crab rangoons. Crab rangoons are extremely popular in my household. Most of the crab rangoons we've gotten in the area have been the same basic construct; cream cheese, imitation crab meat, sometimes shredded carrots but more or less that's it. These crab rangoons actually had REAL crab meat in them!  An absolute first from any Thai restaurant in the greater Portland area. 
This place is really solid. I will definitely return!"
3291,"Excellent drunken noodle dish, prompt and friendly service. A very good Thai food experience."
3292,"There isn't much that stands out about the place but the food was good and the service was awesome.

Super friendly and attentive staff that try to make your experience the best it can be.

The food was good! South Portland doesn't boast too many GREAT restaurants but this little gem off cottage ave is a nice little neighborhood spot.

I'll be happy to go back soon!"
3293,"We started going to Ruby Thai because it's in the most convenient location from our house, and we instantly fell in love with their food. We prefer a lot of their ""typical"" Thai food dishes to many other Thai restaurants out there. It's also a great place for an easy and simple lunch/dinner out if you don't feel like cooking -- never needed to wait for some decent food. 

The only complain/suggestion we have for a Thai restaurant which targets most of its businesses on take-out orders...... please start to open on Sundays!!!! You have no idea how many times we were planning to order take-outs on Sundays and then found out that you are not open after we called in. Why would a take-out restaurant not open on Sundays?? Huhhmmmm.... difficult to understand. But good food!"
3294,"A friendly family style restaurant with consistently fresh tasting ingredients which are individually prepared.
All special requests have been accurately fulfilled.
Don't miss the fried banana desert.

A superb value!"
3295,Very enjoyable first visit. Place is clean and attractive. Food was excellent as was the service. The duck was delicious as was the Crispy Pad Thai. Will return.
3296,"I have had my share of Thai food and this restaurant is in my top three for sure.  We ordered take out and the portions are so huge, you'll have seconds for the next day or for the next round!  

I had Nam Prik Pao stir fry which has Thai chili paste, vegetables, and chicken, seafood, beef, pork, or tofu.  Jasmine rice comes on the side and it's substantial for a meal!  I had it with chicken and I was very pleased.  The dish was seasoned well and I LOVE LOVE LOVE how there's enough sauce to pour over the jasmine rice that it comes with.  I couldn't help myself so I had seconds the same night and I had just enough for a meal the next day.  

Check this Thai spot out!"
3297,"Three stars for service which deserves to be noted up front. The folks here are super sweet but they are consistently behind even with just a moderately busy night. Tonight I called for pick up and was asked to hold. For almost five minutes I sat on the line listening to distant kitchen and dining room sounds. 

That said the food is very good. Some of the best Thai at this price in the area. I like it better than Pom's Thai for example."
3298,"Went here with a group for dinner yesterday - 4th of July. The service was slow but others in our party said the staff was all different than normal. A party of six for dinner was about two hours from start to post-meal conversation. 

I had a few questions about menu items but the server told us it was his very first day so he didn't know. I took a chance on the Almond Tamarind Ginger Chicken, since I am crazy about tamarind flavor. Turned out it was a great choice. I also asked for brown rice instead of white rice. 

Once each of the six people in our party ordered, the wait for food was not too long. Unfortunately, our appetizers came out at the same time as our meals. The fresh rolls were very good, with the rice paper wrapper perfectly cooked and not gummy. 

The dish I chose turned out to be a big winner - delicious chicken, very lightly battered and sautéed, in a tamarind ginger sauce that was not too sweet or sugary. Toasted sliced almonds on top were a great crunchy addition. 

Others ordered mango curry, panang curry, and cashew stir fry, and reported that all were very good. On a night with the regular staff, the service might have been a bit quicker. But it was worth it. I would definitely return, or try the takeout, which was doing a brisk business as well."
3299,"Excellent.   Tasty, authentic Thai. Server charming and friendly.   Cozy place, good for conversation."
3300,"We ordered Red Curry with Tofu medium spice and Green Curry with scallops mild tonight along with the calamari appetizer for takeout tonight  The calamari was delicious, crispy and fresh!   However, the curry dishes were switched and the green was very spicy and the red curry was mild.  Also, the scallops were bay scallops and were sliced lengthwise.  There were a total of 8 ""scallops"" in this portion.  When we called to advise the orders were swapped and express our disappointment in the number of quality of the scallops, we were told the Green Curry does not come mild as explained in the menu.  I went back to review the menu and nowhere did I find this explanation.  They had no explanation as to why this wasn't advised at the time the order was placed. The restaurant had no interest in assisting is with correcting the order. From now on we will go to Pom's Thai Taste."
3301,Portland has its fair share of thai restaurants but I think a Ruby Thai is the best. The Larb Gai is the best I've ever had. Check it out!
3302,This has become a favorite place for my wife and I.  We find ourselves there about once per week.  Love the Crispy Shrimp appetizer and the General Thai chicken.  Not a fancy place but great food.  Yum Yum.
3303,"I went to high school in southern Maine but now live in Boston. I was back home for the weekend and my fiancé and I wanted to go out to eat and I remembered hearing about a new Thai place on Cottage Rd. in South Portland. Both my fiancé and I are Thai food fans, and I in particular am somewhat of a Pad Thai snob... I've eaten a lot of Pad Thai at a lot of different restaurants, and am very judgmental about my Pad Thai, so I was a bit leery of trying a new place.

Ruby Thailand is a bit odd on first approach: It is in a building that clearly used to be a house... the restaurant's dining room clearly used to be a living room. Also, the walls are painted an INSANELY. BRIGHT. ORANGE. Finally, other than the walls that will make you think you're in an LSD trip, the inside is actually pretty bare: there are no curtains, very little on the walls, and the tables are quite basic and institutional.

The place's appearance aside though, the service we received was very good (our waitress was very friendly and very attentive) and the food was EXCELLENT.

... and I mean EXCELLENT.  We had crab rangoons & fresh rolls for appetizers, my fiancé ordered one of the specials for her entree (I forget what it was) and I, as always at Thai places, ordered the Pad Thai. The crab rangoons are made with REAL CRAB. That's right, no crab stick... real, out-of-the-ocean crab. And they're delicious. The fresh rolls were pretty much like you expect fresh rolls to be, but they were very well made (and well put-together... I hate it when fresh rolls fall apart while you're eating them!) and they're served not with the typical peanut sauce, but instead with a hoisin sauce that went very well with them.

Now, the main event: My Pad Thai. As I said before, I am a Pad Thai snob. I've eaten Pad Thai at dozens of restaurants in a dozen cities in a few countries. This was probably the best Pad Thai I've ever had. It was perfectly balanced; the fish sauce was there but not too powerful, and it was sweet but not too sweet.

The food is five stars. I knocked off one star because the ambiance did leave a bit to be desired (if the owners of Ruby Thailand read this review, put some curtains on the windows and get some white tablecloths and this'll be a five-star review!).

My fiancé and I are already planning on going back next time we're in Maine.

P.S.- They also do takeout!"
3304,"Small place in South Portland.  They had ka prao chicken as one of the specials the night I was there.  It was very very good - should be on the permanant menu.  The chicken satay is okaaay but too thick and not that tender.  The yum nua num tok (which is usually called something like 'crying tiger' at other places) is very good.  The flavor was nice but the meat was not that tender on this day in particular.  Staff is friendly and the place is quant.  It is a little cold though - they could turn the heat on a little more especially since there are lots of windows.  Other than that, A-OK."
3305,"2/3 dishes were good. Mine tasted like the sauce was from a bottle of sauce I've bought at trader joes. Not impressed. The other two meals were good, rad nar was very tasty. Service pretty slow tonight, lots of takeout."
3306,"Excellent food - twice in one week excellent!  Crab Rangoon, green curry, and pad Thai - all best I've tasted.  Fast, friendly, attentive service. Will go back ... Next week."
3307,Best pad Thai in Portland. The wait staff and chef/owner are soo nice. I go every chance I get.
3308,"I have been ordering from this place since they opened.  I mean a LOT.  This was a go-to place for me, for group dinners, etc etc.  It is with a heavy heart and after reaching out to the restaurant that I declare my opinion of ""Downhill Alert"".  Its just not been good with any consistency for quite some time and I have given up.  Please someone post if things take an upswing because I am bitterly disappointed not to have this in an area with very limited options."
3309,"We live about a mile from Ruby's and it is our go-to spot for Thai food.  This is by far the best tasting Thai cuisine in the Portland area.  I especially recommend the curried dishes, but have eaten many other entrees and it has all been exceptional.  Having said that, I have learned to call ahead and try to prepare myself to wait for my take-out.  They can take awhile so you have been warned.  And the restaurant atmosphere is sort of sterile, like eating in a McDonald's....so don't go there if you want to impress your date, propose, or whatever.  In short, five star food in a 2 star venue (don't judge my formulary) thus the overall rating. Go to Ruby's for great food and unless you live in a dump consider ordering to go."
3310,"So glad this restaurant is in SoPo!  Great service, very good Thai food.  Fresh ingredients.  Great for take out or staying in."
3311,"Wow! Food here is as fresh as it gets, well prepared, & service is excellent. My husband & I dine at Ruby Thai as often as we get to South Portland. We have never been disappointed & we have been here countless times. For us this is the best Thai in the area. Like many others, we have to mention the unusually good crab rangoon. Never before have we had this with actual crab! However the rest of the menu we have tried is excellent as well. We highly recommend."
3312,"We used to love ruby thai. Today's dinner was a huge disappointment.  Mango curry with chicken.  Four little measly pieces of mango and an equal amount of chicken.  For $16, it was primarily onion and curry sauce and the flavor was not like usual. Hopefully this is a one time occurrence.  My treat to myself was a letdown."
3313,Great Thai food!!! Finally a Pad Thai that is not fishy - it was so yummy. They have brown rice and both green and mango curries were wonderful. Awesome location. Especially for locals and bonus - there's parking.
3314,"This is, by far, the best Thai food in Portland. We have tried most of the thai in the area (Thai Taste, Seang Thai, Veranda Thai, Pom's Thai, etc) and this provides the best spice, is less greasy, and is overall the best. We love it here! The green curry, larb, and drunken noodles are the best!!!"
3315,"This is our go to market.  They have an a large and ever changing wine and beer selection.  Lots of sodas, fruit juice, and  coconut waters as well.  Of all of the sandwiches we have eaten, the House special, roasted turkey, cranberry, mayo and stuffing on a fresh baked roll is DELICIOUS!  We have not had a sandwich that we haven't enjoyed yet.  The owners are always friendly, and offer to do little extras like toast bread, or warm up something for us.  There are other little goodies like banana bread, cookies and other sweet treats.  Good variety of chips and other snacks to go with sandwiches.  Great place to get some tasty sandwiches and drinks for a picnic, lunch treat, or a dinner special."
3316,"Ocean House Market is a little (big?) New England style house that hosts a Market on the first floor. Often advertising their fresh sandwiches and lobster rolls, they have a small picnic table outside during summer and couple of parking spaces on the side.

The market sells mainly wines and other drinks, but also does ice cream and sandwiches.

My friend and I stopped by here to try out their lobster rolls...raved by another friend who's thing is to get a lobster roll from here and watch the waves at Two Light.

Their lobster rolls are pretty big and not bad for their price..about $15~16 and come on a typical bun. What's a little different is the bed of shredded lettuce and the lobster is mixed with mayo, which isn't too strong, but stronger than some other places. I don't think you can request it otherwise.

There's some seating on the interior and the owners are really nice and friendly. They sell some foods and imported goods, so it's worth the look around."
