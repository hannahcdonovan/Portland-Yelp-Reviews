Beers are written on a chalkboard in the back. The majority are local and they have a fantastic variety for most people to find a beer they like. 
Food is written on another chalkboard, cooked right behind the bar and is oddly delicious.
Well priced burgers, tacos, fries with fixing additions of your liking. 

Mash Tun is up front about what you get, delivers well, and has a fantastic crew behind the bar.
I frequent this place whenever in Portland and somehow the bartenders always remember me (and my boyfriend who does the same). 

I almost don't want to write more because i would like to keep finding a seat at the bar to sit at :P",4.5,2,"['29 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.655846142385705,-70.2539712498444,"Burgers, Breweries, "

My friends had food and seemed to enjoy it.  The space is very nice and they have been able to expand into another area next door.  So more seating.

They have TV's which was perfect for watching football and other sports.  The staff was very nice and attentive to our needs, and offered suggestions for their various brews on tap.  It was fun trying different options and comparing the flavors.

They were in the middle of installing their online ordering system and moving away from the paper and pen.  They were excited about how it would speed up service and efficiency.

Looking forward to returning and trying food.",4.5,2,"['29 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.655846142385705,-70.2539712498444,"Burgers, Breweries, "

It's a very eclectic environment and definitely feels like a pub. I wasn't overly hungry, so just ordered the sweet potato brussel sprout hash. It was very good! I did try a few of the truffle and parmesan fries, delicious! Report was the burgers/sandwiches were delicious!
I'm gluten free so beer doesn't draw me, but there is a hefty selection of beers available and quite a few on draught. There are other beverage options as well, including wine, hard cider and non alcohol.

Not only is their beer list always amazing, but they have the most incredible parmesan truffle fries and what is, in my opinion, the best burger in all of Portland. The burger is super affordable, and you can dress it up to your heart's content. My favorite addition to the burger and dipping sauce for fries is their chipotle maple aioli- it's highly addictive and you need it in your life right now. On top of all this amazing food and beer, you have truly wonderful staff. They go beyond being friendly- they make you feel like you're actually friends. They also somehow manage to remember you when you come back in, and that touch really is what pushes them past other nearby spots. Come for the incredible comfort food, stay for the warm environment- you won't be disappointed.",4.5,2,"['29 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.655846142385705,-70.2539712498444,"Burgers, Breweries, "

The cheese plate, even at $8, is a reminiscent of a broke college students version so skip that. Lots of cheese with grilled sandwich bread chunks and vats of honey mustard and jam, a handful of baby doll pickles. Meh. 

The burgers and tacos looked tasty as we watched the food being made at the bar. For pub food I think this would be a hit to visit regularly. Odd set up for the kitchen but it works for them i s'ppose.

Cons:
-I just did not live up to its reputation and the reviews. I had high expectations. 
-Beer list nearly impossible to read from the bar (and I'm not old, nor do I have bad eyesight). The bartenders seemed reluctant to answer questions about what was on tap, and we chose this place because of the beer selection. So that was a major dissapointment. 
-Food was only so-so. Not bad by any means, but the Yelp reviews made me think it would be incredible, and it was average, at best.
-Food menu was small but there was probably something for everyone

Pros:
-Good location if you want to bar hop and walk around the main drag
-As mentioned, food wasn't horrible.
-Depending on where you sit at the bar, you can watch the line cook make your food, which is semi interesting.",4.5,2,"['29 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.655846142385705,-70.2539712498444,"Burgers, Breweries, "

We indulged in plain fries with salt and pepper, they where a little over seasoned for my liking but have tried both the Parmesan and Truffle fries before which is certainly more worth the calories.  I found my visit this time more enjoyable as their were less patrons so my ears where thankful.  I took my sweet baby out for the first time (mommy needed to feel human again and experience Portland downtown) the waiter smiled at me and passed zero judgement for me having my girl in their with me, which is more than I can say for the grumpy old couple sitting adjacent to us (the lady left half a glass of

The bartenders were great and very liberal with their samples, which was nice for someone like me who can never decide if I'll like a beer just from the name or a description. One other thing we noticed was that the bartenders were really upbeat and just seemed to be having a good time, which really contributed to the atmosphere.

Vibe: Since my first visit, they have expanded and now offer way more seating and have a server that is not the bartender. They also have 3 picnic tables outside. This allows you be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery as well as the fabulous people watching. 

Drinks: On any given day, they have 27 beers on tap, all local brews. They vary from Rising Tide to Allagash to Bissell Brothers. All the local favorites. They also (most often) have at least 1 if not 2 local ciders on tap. The bartenders are very knowledgable about the beer they have on tap. 

Food: The burgers are so delicious. One of the best burgers in town. And they are only $6. You can order a side of fries to be the epitome of American or have just the burger. If plain fries don't do it for you, you can get parmesan fries. The grilled cheese was definitely a hit this time around. The apples on it definitely made the sandwich that much better.

1645,1iCe-Wpqn2huOZR8souLqA,mash-tun,1645,2017-01-04,"I THINK I'M IN LOVE (with this bar)!!!!

I've been meaning to go to Mash Tun for weeks and months and finally went on a rainy Tuesday with my BFF, Savage.

First of all, who doesn't love a six dollar burger.  At first, I thought maybe these would be more slider sized or perhaps they skimp on the toppings and make it a more ""fast food"" type of burger.  NOPE.  This burger was big, well cooked (medium to medium rare) and had the standard toppings.  While I wouldn't say it was the BEST burger I have ever had, I would say based on the price to quality ratio, it was definitely up there at the top!!!  We also split the parmesan cheese fries for five bucks.  Okay, who doesn't love literally a pile of French fries with a pile of parm cheese on top.  This isn't super fancy food, but it's delicious and good quality and way better than the five guys you were going to consume instead. 

The drinks were super amazing.  Let's be real: drinks in P-town are expensive AF compared to the rest of Maine, but I feel like the cocktails were well crafted, they had a wide range of bourbon and whiskey (HECK YES), and the beer was supposed to be ""special beer"".  I don't drink beer, so you're going to have to take the website's word on this or reference another Yelper's review.  You will drop some cash if you try to ""get crunk"" here, but I'd think of this atmosphere as more of a casual dinner with friends/HH place anyways or a good start to your Friday and not a traditional wharf street bar.  It's worth the couple of extra bucks for the better quality and you're kind of evening out the super inexpensive food prices.  

Lastly, the bartender we had was AMAZING.  He was super friendly but not fake and he was good to have a discussion with, but was totally happy letting us be while Savage and I exchanged belated Christmas presents and squealed about her new boyfriend (I'm pretty sure this isn't a secret but shhh if it is...).  

I would strongly recommend this bar and I'm super happy I finally went in here (even if it was raining buckets).",4.5,2,"['29 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.655846142385705,-70.2539712498444,"Burgers, Breweries, "

1671,1iCe-Wpqn2huOZR8souLqA,mash-tun,1671,2017-07-04,"Unfortunately, my Mash Tun experience was quite different than those of other Yelpers'. My friends and I were visiting Portland for the July 4 weekend from NY and ended up at Mash Tun based on the raving Yelp review and it was certainly dismal to say the least..

FOOD: You literally get what you pay for. The $10 Grilled Cheese sandwich was probably the best thing on the menu. Do not order the tacos. The shredded pork was sauceless and I think they expect you to order sauces on the side. My girlfriend tried to save the tacos with ketchup and mustard to no avail..

SERVICE: The service was definitely subpar. Again, my experience might've been different because maybe this is the standard in Portland. This most certainly would not fly in NYC. The waittress was friendly at first when we ordered but once we ordered she was pretty much nowhere to be seen. We had to ask for napkins once the food came out after which she returned with 3 napkins (there were 4 of us). She kept on leaving before I finished my requests.

While folks from away are distracted with the shiny or new or seemingly trendy spots that are overpriced and have hour long waits... locals, you should really be paying attention to this hidden-in-plain-sight gem that's tucked just slightly away from the hustle and bustle of where everything else is. 

The wait to get in has been nonexistent to minimal.
It's a charming, sunny little spot that has an array of different, comfortable seating.
The staff is genuinely very friendly, engaging, accommodating, and warm.
There's usually a ton of available on street parking nearby.

And the food is out of this world good, hearty, and priced right too. If you love breakfast sandwiches, don't miss out on the Pesto Breakfast Sandwich - scrambled eggs, basil pesto, spinach, and provolone cheese all toasted on french peasant bread - it's straight-up ENORMOUS. My favorite is the Sardou Eggs Benedict - think spinach artichoke dip topped with poached eggs topped with hollandaise. It's decadent, it's rich, and it's glorious. While it comes on Tuscan bread and served with a side of home fries, I'd almost rather have it on top of the potatoes instead. I wonder if this is something they'd do!? Drool.

Don't skip out on their baked goods either - giant ooey, gooey cinnamon rolls, delightfully tangy apple donuts, various melt-in-your-mouth scones and cookies, all absolutely delicious!",4.5,2,"['61 Pleasant St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65393,-70.25917,"Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Cafes, "

6011,yS_a0_VrYufO9WVgXQpaiw,artemisia-cafe,6011,2019-01-12,"Artemisia Cafe has been around for a long time.  I used to take my daughter there when she was little, and then just kind of lost my way back for far too many years.
When same daughter suggested we meet up with some friends for an annual pre-Christmas brunch at Artemisia, I happily agreed, and boy am I glad I did.  
I am a big fan of brunch.  I love meeting friends to catch up over Benedicts, and have even been known to sip a pot of tea over an egg scramble on my own.  I love to take advantage of the slow pace of a weekend morning.
First, the tables and general space is comfortable, warm, cozy and lovely.  There are small touches of stained glass, and even things like an adorable glass creamer, that add to the atmosphere.  I would recommend a booth as they create a private space to talk and catch up, and all booths are against a big glass window.  If you hit it on the right morning, you will also be rewarded with ample amounts of sunshine.
The staff is warm and friendly.  In the last few weeks, I feel like i've already made a new friend on the waitstaff.  I've read in past reviews a concern over waiting a long time for food to arrive, but I have not found that to be true at all.  As a matter of fact, i've marveled at how quickly dishes come to the table after ordering!
There are a few specials posted each morning in addition to the regular menu.  There is also a full bar for any or all brunch cocktails you might care for.  Baked goods are typically on the specials board.  Last weekend I had an eclair at Artemisia that changed everything I thought I knew about eclairs. 
Which brings me to the food.  Inventive, delicious, fresh, and prepared with an expert hand.  Everything and anything i've ordered here has been very, very good. 
This morning, I had the eggs Sardou, a Benedict with artichokes and spinach which was amazing.  
Last weekend, I went for one of my AM staples, a western omelette.  It was elevated with caramelized onions and peppers and freshly smoked ham chunks.

My husband and I decided to come here on a Saturday morning for breakfast, and knowing that it was a small cafe, we were expecting to wait for a table. However, when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and we were instantly brought to our booth by a window. For it being 10:30am on a Saturday in Portland, there were only a few other couples in the cafe, which was surprising, but it added to the quiet, easy aesthetic of the venue. 

The menu has various takes on typical breakfast foods. From a variety of scrambles, omelettes, benedicts, and french toasts, there is something for everyone, but Artemisia elevates these options into something amazing. I ended up ordering the Sardou, which was a benedict with creamed spinach and artichokes on tuscan bread, and it was served with home fries. It was an explosion of flavor and the bread that it was on really added to the wholesomeness of the dish. My husband ordered the scramble with kielbasa, which was equally delicious and had amazing amounts of flavor. We also shared a cinnamon roll, which was flaky and had a nice amount of icing on it. 

Sounds like a 5 star review, right? The only thing that keeps me from giving Artemisia 5 stars is the service. Our waitress was incredibly nice, however, we were barely checked on. My husband only ordered water for a drink, and he had to be the one to consistently stop her for more. Then, we got our food and we weren't checked on until both of us were done our meals. 

Will the service stop me from going back? Absolutely not, as I definitely plan on coming back to try more of the items on their menu. However, after experiencing the service and reading other reviews, I think this is an area of opportunity for them.

Artemisia is a cute little restaurant nestled in the West End. If it weren't for Yelp, I probably would have never stumbled across this place just walking around downtown. 

We walked in around 11AM on a Saturday and were sat at a booth right away. The place was fairly busy, but not packed which was nice and relaxing. 

The menu provides a variety of brunch options that take a step outside of your ""standard breakfast"" options which I really appreciate. They had some interesting benedict options and this delicious sounding pesto sandwich. However, I chose to go with the Kielbasa Hash and a Cinnamon Roll to start (couldn't resist as they were just staring at me on the bar as we initially walked in). 

The Cinnamon Roll was very tasty. They heat it up a little bit so that you get a nice warm center and heated frosting. The roll was pretty big and I was happy to share with another. 

The Kielbasa Hash was pure deliciousness. The meal came in a large bowl that was filled with home fries and kielbasa and topped with some cheese and an over easy egg. Everything together was incredibly tasty! This was a HUGE portion and despite my best effort, I was unable to finish everything. The meal also comes with a side of toast raspberry some jam which was wonderful. 

Now the only thing keeping this review from a 5 star was the service. Unfortunately, our service here was not great. It took several minutes to get greeted by our server and she never followed up on our table. She only came over to us when she was dropping off our drinks or food.

And of course that means after way, way too many years a friend who lives here and I got to go have dinner!  She chose Artemsia Cafe and what a great choice.

Since she's a veggie it was great they had more than one option for her. She had the squash ravioli, which looked divine. I partook in the special and it was just as described - special! They have this every Wednesday night - $20 for a salad, spaghetti and meatballs and a glass of Chianti (I said that with my best Sir Anthony Hopkins voice). Oh - and a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, but given that there's a ton of snow on the ground and it's really, really cold here right now - I skipped it and we shared the zeppole. The honey was a great touch.

The spaghetti was cooked just right - sticky enough that sauce actually stuck. The sauce was light and good and the meatballs cooked just right. I may have made the sauce a little more garlicky myself, personal preference. I could have used a little less dressing on the salad, but that's on me for not asking for it on the side. 

The service was just enough to feel like they were paying attention, but not so much you felt like you had a stage five clinger staff on hand.

There were just 2 people outside the place who were waiting ahead of us.  When we came in, we were told that the wait could be about 25 minutes.  Which was strange because we saw about 3 tables that were free  and I am only talking about what was within our sight from the door.  Who knows there could be more inside that we could not see.  And yet, we saw 4 groups called before we were called, which was already past 45 minutes.  When we raised this to the waitresses and front door lady, they seemed unshaken and did not give us any explanation.  And then, we were called and seated, and while in our table, we waited for yet another 20 minutes before our food came in, making our wait effectively more than an hour.  

While waiting for our food, we read reviews and yelp, and voila - the problems we were having have already been raised  by others hear - long wait,  understaffed.  The understaffing situation could be the problem, because as we waited for 45 minutes, 4 groups were called to come in but we never saw anyone step out and leave their tables.  Which makes it clear that they were not filling up tables because they probably cannot cope with the demand, with only 3 women running the place on a peak hour of Sunday brunch.  

We were so disappointed that we left very little tip, and as we headed to the parking lot, we were chased by one of the ladies who screamed ""thanks, folks!"" in a sarcastic way.

The service is kind of hit or miss from what I've experienced. Sometimes it's fast, other times the waitresses couldn't care less about you. The food, however, is the saving grace here.

It's creamed spinach, artichoke hearts over a piece of tuscan bread, topped with poached eggs and hollandaise. So. Good. Their home fries are to die for as well.

Having spent 25 years in the restaurant biz, I watched with bemused detachment as they all went about their jobs with nary a concern for clearing off tables as the line grew behind us.
