0,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,0,2019-04-13,"WOW. Street & Co is certainly the spot for romantics! It's cozy, and I love that the kitchen has an open concept. It feels like you have your own personal chefs for the night. 

We ordered the Lobster Diavolo, which comes with a whole lobster split in half, tons of clams, mussels, a sprinkle of squid all served on top of a bed of pasta with flavorful, spicy tomato sauce. IT WAS AH-MAZING. I can't even. When I moved to Maine, THIS WAS EXACTLY what I was looking for when I envisioned seafood galore! 

Also, they serve unlimited butter and bread!",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

All of this made us so excited for dinner. We ordered blackened char and the scallops pernod. And when they came out, our eyes were bright and our mouths were watering. But then we tasted the food and it was just overpowering with saltiness. Everything was wayyyy or a bit too salty. We scraped all the seasoning off the artic char and it was still too salty. Not to mention the greens. A bummer, since we were so excited to visit this spot from out of town. 

The service was also great. We were just disappointed by the main event. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing...

5,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,5,2018-11-04,"This review is from Thursday, Oct 18, 2018.

How fortunate we were to have this restaurant in walking distance of our hotel.  The valet recommended this location and show did my cell recommendations.  We couldn't find a park, so we drove our car back to the hotel and took a walk.  This place was packed.  The people we were in line behind, said they had reservations, we did not.  We were seated in the bar area and spoke to a couple who currently reside in Colorado, but stated that they have been to this restaurant many times because they love it.  He went on to state that he got reservations the moment they were opened up. Ok.  This place should be good.  Long lines, reservations and a wonderful aroma.

We ended up waiting about thirty minutes for our table, but it was so worth it.  Our order was put in right away and we nibbled on some of their bread while we waited for our meal.

The Grilled Lobster on Linguine, Butter and Garlic was superb.  This meal was well worth the $39.95.  Please see the picture showing how I devoured it.  My dinner mate opted for the ahi tuna with broccolini in a pesto sauce and some roasted red potatoes.  I don't do raw fish (just slightly cooked on the outside and raw in the inside), so I can't say how her fish tasted (she really enjoyed it), but the broccolini was delicious.  It just had a hint of pesto and lemon.  Very tasty.  

Here's What I Think...I want to go back to Maine, just so I can enjoy this meal again.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

They had their lobster diavalo since the pictures from others looks so epic, and I can confirm it is indeed epic! The pasta was super tasty, the seafood in it had so much flavor, and if was massive! Definitely the thing to order for a hungry group. 
We also got the garlic shrimp pasta, which was heavenly and tasted amazing, definitely recommended. The pasta with scallops and affredo sauce was not too good though, it's on the heavy side with way too much cream and cheese, but that's what it is supposed to be so can't complain there, should have gotten their pan seared scallop dish instead.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
8,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,8,2018-08-22,"When in Maine... one must eat lobster!?! This restaurant is hidden away in a cobblestone alleyway. The lines are quite long, and it took us an hour to get in for dinner without a reservation. It was worth it. Inside, it looks like a food cellar in colonial times with all the vegetables hanging from the celings.

For the food, I split a bunch of dishes with my friends since the serving sizes are quite large. The lobster bread pudding for an appetizer was so rich and definitely a pleasant surprise. Typically, I thought bread puddings were supposed to be sweet desserts. This was really well balanced and there are chunks of lobster that, combined with the vegetables, cheese, and bread pudding, made for a really good mouth feel that was packed with flavor.

The main dish was the lobster diavolo for 2. Technically, I probably could have eaten this type of dish in Boston at some place supposedly called Giacomo's. I'll have to update my review when I actually go there to compare. The sauce is really good, which is a tomato based sauce that probably has white wine and herbs. It has all the juices of the mussels, lobsters, clams, and calamari. There is so much pasta beneath the seafood. If you have the stomach for it, make sure to order extra bread to dip into the sauce! To be honest, for normal people, this dish could probably be split with 3-4 people.

Our other friends got some pastas and we ended up trading some of our dish to get theirs. One was the Scallops in Pernod and Cream pasta, and it comes inside the pan they cook it in?!? The white sauce is really delicious, and the scallops are tender and quite big. I think I stole a lot of those..heheh. The other pasta was the Shrimp with Butter and Garlic linguine. This dish was also quite good, but I didn't have time to eat much because it disappeared so fast. It's very buttery, and the shrimps were pretty fresh. Again, the sauce is so good on all of these pastas that you just have to soak it up in bread, gluten-free critics and low carb diets be damned.

Somehow we made room for dessert. On our way to the tables, I could see the pies sitting out in the kitchen and they looked so good. Maine is probably famous for blueberries, but I decided to get a pecan pie, They heat it up in the oven and you can get it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Really decadent way to close out the probably 100000 calorie meal we just consumed. 

The service here is excellent, and they even give you warm towels with lemon if you eat any of the lobsters since it can get messy cracking open the shells.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
9,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,9,2018-09-17,"Follow the wisdom of the crowds here and just get the Lobster Fra Diavolo for two. Trust me.

The other dishes are solid and don't quite justify the price point, but all that is forgiven again by how excellent the Fra Diavolo is both in price and in quality.

But oh yeah, don't skip dessert. The bourbon pecan pie was one of the most balanced takes on the sweet I've had to date- not overly sweet or gloopy. Do yourself a favor and add a scoop of ice cream to round it all out.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

12,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,12,2019-02-07,"Went in January and there were only two reservation options open: first seating or last. We decided on an early dinner and headed over. It was right next to or hotel so we arrived before they started seating. The bartender was very friendly. He talked about a new cocktail he was working on that wasn't on the menu yet. It sounded good so we acted as guinea pigs for him- it was good, very good.

The dining room has a nice cozy feel. We were seated next to a group of guys who were discussing plans for opening a summer camp and it was a great conversation to eavesdrop on.

For appetizers we had grilled octopus and a simple salad. Both were excellent. I had blackened char for my entree and my wife had lobster with linguine. My fish was cooked perfectly and the side of potatoes and broccolini were great. Hers came with an entire split, grilled lobster and once we shucked that bad boy it was delicious in the garlicky sauce. Made good leftovers for when we got home too!

All and all this might have been the food highlight of our trip to Portland (maybe a tie with central provisions).

WOW. 
It was a bit pricey... but so worth it. Split between 2 people, we were left super full and satisfied. 
The bread they also give in the beginning is really good. I always make the mistake of eating too much of it.. but worth it.
The seafood pasta with lobster on top was amazing. They did not skimp out on the seafood. So many mussels and clams. All the seafood tasted fresh too. My only complaint is that the some parts of the lobster meat was watery/mushy. 

Also, it's $70 for this dish FYI (not $50 as it says on yelp haha)

Walking into the restaurant from the cobblestone streets was in itself delightful! My boyfriend's buddy recommended this place to us when we took a weekend get-a-away together. Unfortunately, it was back in November and I can not list what my boyfriend and I ordered because we both ordered the specials of the night! (See pictures below)

I can vouch that both meals were absolutely delicious! My fish was cooked perfectly! So creamy, super moist, and its meaty texture satisfied my appetite.

The service was exceptional. Our waitress made sure we had everything we needed and could not have been more helpful in listing all the ingredients so we were aware of what was in the food. There were so many great options it was hard to choose from.

Per previous reviews, anticipate approximately an hour wait. It was definitely worth the wait! My boyfriend and I came here and only ordered the Lobster Diavolo for 2, approximately ~60. It's a huge pot of linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, and a lobster. This was the ONLY thing we ordered, no bread, no appetizer, nada, and we were full out of our minds. This dish alone was enough for dinner and lunch the next day! The linguine was cooked perfectly. The seafood was fresh. The lobster meat was so tender. The dish was a teeny bit spicy, but overall, awesome taste and deal! 

We never skip on dessert, so we ordered panna cotta and the strawberry rhubarb pie, a la mode. I would 1000% advise you to order the rhubarb pie. The crust is made of cornmeal, but it was crumbly, warm, and buttery and absolutely awesome with ice cream and the tart, sweet, strawberry rhubarb filling.

It is delicious indeed and full of flavor. It's honestly a pound of pasta and generous amounts of seafood (clams, squid, mussels and a whole lobster).
They had a crabmeat mushroom pasta appetizer that evening that I found to be far superior to the lobster dish. It's a different flavor profile (not dosed in heavy handed garlic or tomato...phew) which I enjoyed far more. I wish I ordered a double portion for dinner.
I've had their scallops in Pernod cream in the past, delicious but the sides are so uninspiring. And I remember the grain (farro) was a bit underdone to my liking. For the cost of these dishes ($30+) I expect a bit more for the accompaniments to a seafood plate than a spoonful of whatever grain cooked en masse and a vegetable.

For our entree, we decided on the clam linguine with white sauce. Although we enjoyed it, I would recommend trying something with a red or Alfredo sauce if you plan to get the mussels.

43,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,43,2018-05-07,"My husband planned an incredible birthday weekend for me, filled with good seafood in Portland, ME.  It's hard to go wrong in this town because everything is so food-esque and chef-y but Street and Co. is definitely the best.  It's a good experience, with a lively atmosphere, open kitchen, friendly service. Prices are also decent for the portion of food you get... 

Of course we got the famed lobster diavolo ($60), and honestly it says it feeds two but you could probably fee 3 or 4. We're pigs so the server said we had ""above average consumption"" **sheepish** but honestly, all the elements were very tasty so it's hard to put down. You get: 

- A full lobster, which was fresh and well done. They crack some of it for you but you still have to do some work. The server was great about refilling our bowl for shells, etc. 
-Linguine pasta in a yummy spicy tomato sauce, arribata style 
-Tons and tons of fresh clams, mussels (meaty!), and calamari (the worst and the least)

A filling, delicious meal. 

We also tried some of the ""tastes"" which were craft little bites, creatively done. Among them, a cooked tuna dolma (stuffed grape leaf) with dirty rice - my fave. Halibut salad stuffed in a red piqullo pepper, and the Arctic Char type of deviled egg. Which was actually yummy considering I don't love deviled eggs. 

For drinks, my hubby had a local beer, and two cocktails - 1) the cocchi which was a bubbly processco type of refreshing cocktail, and 2) the Night Out which was a boozy martini type drink with savignon blanc. This was a pretty boozy cocktail. 

For dessert, we shared a light, airy Greek Yogurt Cake. It came with citrus notes, and pistachio. It's not everyone's cup of tea- quite light and perhaps tarte but I don't like really sweet desserts so it was perfect for me. They put a nice candle on it for me since it was my birthday and gave plenty of well wishes along the way.

For dinner I got the lobster with linguine. The lobster was delicious as expected and the linguine was great but I thought it had too much garlic in it. Towards the end of it I was trying to get the last few strands of linguine and was just getting full scoops of chopped garlic.

45,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,45,2018-07-14,"Street & Co is a member of the family of restaurants that include Fore Street and Scales and after a great dinner at Fore we gave it a whirl.

Upon entering the joint I was immediately cramped... not just because of the amount of people (it's very popular) but also because of the low ceilings and crammed layout.  As we waited for our table we ordered drinks in the lounge area which did not have a bar, rather various low tables and peripheral seating against a wall.  Somehow we found a couple is chairs on the periphery while we sipped our drinks but it was hard to relax as I constantly had to re adjust to let others pass as their tables were ready.  When our table came up we were ushered to a twofer against a brick wall, which I actually welcomed since that meant that there would be no traffic to one side.  I know I'm harping on this as it should be about the food, but it's important to mention that if you are not in to continuous bustle and the related acoustic cacophony heightened by wood-beamed low ceilings this is not a good choice for dinner.  Romance will not be had here!  On several table passes, various diners kept bumping our roasting pans that housed are mains as the handles extended out a bit.  Ugh!!  But on to the food:

Our starters were good-- the octopus was tender enough and maybe under-spiced and I missed the crunchy char that is often a highlight of this dish.  The Manchego membrillo starter would have been better for dessert as the combo of the paste with a fig cake created a sweetness imbalance with the cheese.  My fault though, so no big deal.  The heirloom tomato salad was the best of the three as the produce was amazingly fresh and not eclipsed by an overbearing dressing.  Maybe the olives were house cured or so they seemed!

The whole fish Branzino came atop a braised kale and mushroom base with a balsamic broth that paired perfectly with the white flesh of the fish.  I'm not usually a fan of white flaky anything in the fish camp but they nailed this treatment on the flavor spectrum.  The shrimp came atop a scampi like ""white sauced"" linguini and it was expectedly rich, decadent and teeming with roasted garlic and julienned basil.  The shrimp was sadly a tad over-done which made it dense and a bit chewy instead of that ""pop"" one gets when it's cooked to perfection.  My wife and I both thought the sauce had some other element that made the dish denser like ground pine nuts etc.... when we asked our serve said it was just garlic that was roasted..... I'm still not buying it though as this dish is one of my own specialties and garlic doesn't get to that denseness unless toasted to a golden color.

We paired the meal with a 2013 Sancerre which was a great choice if I do say so myself!

And thus I'll end by saying that it was a decent meal, not spectacular, and the ambience was aggravating.  Oh and our clothes smelled of the place long after leaving.  Fore St was better on all levels.

The great was the food and ambiance.  Excellent and I'd give it 5 stars.  
The bad, and I mean bad, was the blond hostess who just couldn't be more unpleasant and unwelcoming.  Completely lacking the ability to smile or get a greeting out of her mouth.  She acted as though she was doing everyone a huge favor to allow them to eat there.  

And it wasn't just us that she was unpleasant to, we were waiting to be seated when three other couples arrived for their reservation and she treated them like they were annoying her.  One of the couples actually asked us what her problem was!   I also saw her delivering some of the food to a few tables later on and she put them down on the tables as though it was beneath her to deliver food.  No smile, no words, just dropping the plates with a cold face and walking away. 

Maybe she was the owner's wife because it's impossible to understand any other circumstance which would put such a cold and unfriendly person in that position.  She's the first impression and trust me when I tell you, it's not a good one.
  
Normally I wouldn't bother mentioning a hostess, unless I had something great to say, and it pains me to reduce this rating to 3 stars because of one person but she really was a such an immediate and complete negative from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  

When we left, I said goodbye to her just to see if she would even respond at all.  She didn't.  

Anyway, the food was incredible.  Grilled octopus appetizer, tuna appetizer with oil and salt, freshly grilled halibut to perfection.

60,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,60,2018-04-06,"Note: a huge portion of this 5 star review is due to the heavy garlic usage in both dishes we had - I am garlic obsessed and would not recommend Street & Co. to anyone that is sensitive or has an aversion to garlic.

After reading rave Yelp reviews of the Lobster Diavolo, I knew that I had to come here for dinner. The stars aligned and when we walked in, two seats opened up at the bar and we were able to sit right down! The ambiance in the bar/lounge area is a bit different than the rest of the restaurant and I'd actually recommend the bar over the dining room if possible. The rest of the restaurant was crowded and the lighting was much brighter - whereas in the bar area, it felt much cozier. 

FOOD: 
We ordered the Mussels Provencal to start which were delicious. Big, juicy mussels with a garlicky broth - for $13.95 it was a huge portion that actually left us more full than anticipated. For our main course, we split the Lobster Diavolo which was unreal. The pictures are deceptive - my husband and I pride ourselves on being able to eat a lot (seafood in particular) and we were unable to finish this dish. Two lobster tails, clams, mussels, and calamari all on top of a huge serving of pasta. Again, very garlicky but oh so delicious. Perhaps if we hadn't started with a huge appetizer of mussels, we'd have been able to eat more of it. 

All in all, our experience here was fantastic. The amount of seafood you get for the price is absolutely unheard of in Boston. The value and garlic made it a 5 star win for me and I'll most definitely be trying to come back when I'm in Portland again!",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
61,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,61,2018-02-25,"Finally  I managed to hit up this place at 2nd attempt!

My 1st attempt coming here was cancelled since there was 45 minute wait without reservation and I was too HANGRY to wait..haha

On my 2nd attempt, after learning from the 1st experience, I decided to make reservation to avoid similar outcome during one of my dinners. My friends and I who all were visiting from NY were seated immediately. I immediately noticed the open kitchen concept, where I was able to see how the food was prepared. The place smelled so good from all the butter/spices/aromatics that constantly came from the kitchen..mm hmm.

So we shared the lobster fra diavolo and scallop with cream sauce. And finished off the meal with Bourbon pecan pie a la mode. The scallop dish unfortunately for me was so so. I remembered it came with some kind of 
farro it somehow did not soak up the creamy flavor. The scallop was okay, a little much smaller in size and not many of it in the pan. Not sure it worth the price tag. The lobster fra diavolo meanwhile was awesome. It's got rich tomato based flavor sauce and loaded with seafood. Definitely sharable even for 3 people.  We even managed to still clean up the leftover sauce with bread. The A la mode pecan pie was perrrfect. Warm bourbon infused pie meets cold ice cream. Perfect ending to the meal.
All in all, a little pricey meal (but then everybody knows that vacation is NOT the time to save money) but it was a great experience.

Great place to eat for an out of town visitors! Or catch up with friends/ date. Remember: ALWAYS make reservation. Reservation seems to be the norm for restaurants in Portland generally otherwise be prepared to wait for a while! (READ: Eternity)

As for as I know, they have three rooms in restaurant: one is a bar, the middle is for walk-in customers, and the last room is for reservations. The bar is just a lounge area for drinks and maybe small snacks. The walk-in section and the reservation area looked the same except the open kitchen is part of walk-in section so all the smoke filled that room up. We didn't really mind.

My husband and I chose to sit at the bar for dinner. We were greeted by a women who waited on us part of the time with some younger guys, too, that were working behind the bar. We had a bottle of Pinot noir and shared tastes and small plates. Since my husband doesn't do oysters, I had a half dozen myself. They were served with a mignonette. The oysters served were on the smaller side. I like horseradish or Tabasco with my oysters and neither came with or were offered. The three tastes we had were the goat cheese with pea purée & cracker; manchego with fig cake; and crispy jamon with fiddleheads. All were just a taste, really not a shareable dish. So taste means just that - a bite. This is not a complaint but more informative for you to make your ordering decisions. The goat cheese and that pea purée was just delicious. It was surprisingly not a soft goat cheese. The fig cake served with the manchego was the bomb...we loved it!  The manchego was easily shared as there were a few pieces of cheese. The crispy jamon was very crispy. It was so small that it really was just enough for one person to pop in their mouth. The accompanying fiddleheads were so dressed with vinegar that I choked upon tasting them. Next we ordered the mussels and the calamari appetizers. Both were so good! The mussels were large in size and plentiful. The flavorful broth was sopped up with crusty bread...yum. The calamari came in a tomato sauce. This also was a good-sized portion and tasty. Both fish dishes were plenty to share between the two of us. Overall, we really enjoyed our dining experience. Usually, servers are more interactive and friendlier than what I encountered here, so I took away a star for the lackluster service of those working the bar area.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

Since I'm back in Portland in April this time, I decided to give it a try. At around 11.30am on a Sunday, the wait was only 40 minutes long for a table for four. The wait time definitely increased a lot as it got closer to lunch time. 

I strongly recommend everyone to get the poutine with the full works - with duck confit and topped with a fried egg. The umami-rich gravy, gooey cheese curds, duck confit pieces and the oozing egg yolk makes this a dish from heaven for lovers of fries. If you prefer non-soggy fries, the regular duck fat fries are also equally amazing. We ordered the flight of sauces and it was a nice experience sampling the different sauces.

The fried Brussel sprouts special with bacon bits was also very delicious, you should definitely get it if you like both crispy brussel sprouts and bacon. 

I was very interested in their craft sodas and decided on the ginger drink. While it tasted better than a regular ginger ale, I would have like it to have a stronger ginger flavor and perhaps slightly less sweet.",4.5,2,"['43 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.660206085231295,-70.2503810791679,"American (New), "

I wish I liked the fries more than I did. I appreciated the poutine, as there is no way one could ever hate cheese and gravy covered fries. But, back to the fries themselves- they were kind of lacking in flavor and distinct texture. For a place that is known for their fries, I wouln't write home about these. But the rest of the food was excellent!

The fries were what sealed the deal for me. They were sooo crispy. I thought my boyfriend was eating potato chips across the table because of the crunchy noises he was producing.

It's worth waiting it out at Duckfat. You will get a buzzer when a table is ready for you. 

Duckfat brings dynamic flavor with an amazing quality of food. I had the poutine and got everything with it. Large (yes!) Egg (yes!) Duck Confetti (Heck Yes!). The different flavor came together beautiful. Quite delicious. Highly recommend ordering. I also ordered brussels sprout which they had as a special. Brussels sprout was done well as you could taste the bits of the maple bacon with the vinagrette. I figured given the wait, I should take advantage of all the great food Duckfat has to offer- I also got the pulled pork cubano and original milkshake. The pulled pork cubano also goes to a good cause-a $1 of the sandwich went to charity.  That's pretty cool. A popular socially responsible restaurant. Now I only wish that they had a bigger space.

BUT everyone said not to skip the paninis, so we decided to make a whole meal of it. First of all, I recommend coming early. The space is small, and the hype is large. We waited for about 40 minutes at 11AM. While we were eating, the wait went up to over 2 hours, and they had to stop taking people on the waitlist. The staff was very helpful though, and we were able to browse the local shops while waiting. 

Once seated, we were able to watch the kitchen action. The staff here is no joke! The whole kitchen was incredibly organized and efficient. I have to give it up for the staff here; I don't know how they keep up with the orders. They never stopped moving the whole time we were there! 

We decided to share several items to get a little taste of everything. We started with a small order of fries (perfect for 2 unless you really want to chow down on some fries) with the truffle ketchup. What a perfect combo! There's nothing better than well-seasoned fries and ketchup, and Duckfat did not disappoint. The fries were hot, perfectly seasoned, and the ketchup really packed a truffle punch. I could've eaten these all day! 

Next, we had the tomato fennel soup. So I saw the soup on Yelp and thought it looked amazing, but in general, I hate fennel. I decided to try it anyway, and I'm so glad I did! The fennel is not overwhelming at all, and the soup is very well balanced. We saw them sampling and checking the soup several times while dining, and I was really impressed with the attention given to each product. This soup is perfect to warm you up on a chilly day. 

Finally, we split one of the Porchetta paninis, which is their current special. The panini was topped with giardiniera, salsa verde, garlic mayo and provolone. First of all, these sandwiches are BIG and rich. Perfect for splitting if you're ordering fries and other things. The panini WAS fantastic though. DO. NOT. SKIP. THE. PANINIS. It came out piping hot and dripping fantastic sauces all melted together under the hot panini press. I'm bummed I will probably never get to eat this specific sandwich again! 

Overall, I was incredibly impressed with Duckfat. I feel like a lot of ""hyped up"" places eventually compromise on quality, but that is certainly not the case here. Since it was so busy when we visited, many people were placing carryout orders. They waited for the customer to arrive to box their fries so they were hot and not soggy. Their carryout option is great for larger parties! The area is quite small, so I imagine it is very difficult to get in without waiting forever.

216,HdQr2QayY8pZAHM8fiG0mw,duckfat,216,2019-03-02,"One word: Duckfat.

When I said to a colleague in Boston that I was headed to Portland for the weekend, he said, simply: Duckfat. 

That was my first indication that this was a thing. I yelped it, of course. And when I got to where I was staying, I said to the clerk that I was walking over to Duckfat for lunch. She pointed down the street in the general direction of. I asked for clarification. 

Oh, you'll see it, she said.

I didn't know what she meant but when I walked down the nearly deserted street and turned in the general direction of Duckfat, I looked down another nearly deserted street. And that's when I saw it: a crowd of people standing on the sidewalk in what otherwise looked like a ghost town. This must be it. 12:30 on a cold Friday afternoon, this place is jammed. I forged ahead. (Fast forward to me, with the blessing of the very busy hostess, finding a single seat at the bar. Yay! I hadn't eaten breakfast and had just finished a two-hour drive from Boston so I was ready.) 

Both hostess (who brought me menus and welcomes) and the bartender/server were great. Bartender (Charlie!) was helpful and friendly and attentive to the actual needs of eating/drinking. Every server seemed happy and good, so that's a plus. The turnover was swift -- I guess they'd have to be at lunchtime. 

But. The fries ($5.50) weren't as good as I expected. They're good, as most attentively cooked and freshly served fries are, but they're not good in the way that duck fat fries can be. I've had potato wedge fries cooked in duck fat both at a restaurant and at home (using the leftover oil from two deep-fried ducks), and both were wayway better than these fries. Those two had that peculiar rich duck flavor. The fries at Duckfat didn't. Or at least they had only a hint of it. It got me wondering about how much duck fat they actually used.... so I asked. The answer -- and, yeah, cheers for being open and honest and direct -- was 35% duck fat, 65% canola oil. Would they have tasted better with more duck fat? Would they have tasted better if I hadn't been subject to outsized expectations from all the hype? I'm wary of hype, so maybe I had my guard up. Maybe I wasn't going to like them enough, no matter what. I dunno. They were good, not great.The sauce (thai-something) was tasty but not as addictive as I expected. Again, the hype. (Maybe I should have asked for regular ketchup??)

The cubano panini ($12.50), however, was the best I've ever had. Totally awesome with layers of pickles and meat and sauce on a crusty bread of some sort. I ate half then and half for breakfast (after microwaving it for 33 seconds) and, I have to say, it was still amazing. For this? Five stars. 

And another star or two for the idea of Duckfat, an amazing storefront hustle. The place isn't that big. In fact, it's tiny. And the kitchen, even smaller, is probably just a deep-frier and a panini machine. They might as well be printing $100 bills back there. If this isn't a chain, it should be. I'd like to own one in Boston.

tl;dr: good food, good service, fast turnover; forget the hype, have a sandwich with fries.",4.5,2,"['43 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.660206085231295,-70.2503810791679,"American (New), "

The shake was one of the best I have ever had. We ordered one and they split it between two glasses for us. I loved the bread used on the paninis. The fries were perfect.

We also split the overnight duck panini, which had great flavor and a perfect crisp! A few bites were less saucy than others, but overall delicious.

Also, if you love a good milkshake, get the traditional Duckfat milkshake. It's not too sweet, and dipping your fries is perfect.

The duckfat fries are pretty good, but not amazing. I really like the flight of sauces - great variety and creative flavors. The poutine was a disappointment... I've definitely had better poutine before. I also got a duck confit panini, which also turned out disappointing. It simply lacked flavor.

True to their name, the duckfat is used to make the most delicious bites.  From fries, to poutine, to the fried brussel sprouts to the milkshakes- you cannot go wrong.  There are a handful of sauces that you can choose for the fries so you have many options if you want something with a kick, something sweet, or something light.  Definitely worth it to find the one or two that are right for you!

The fried brussel sprouts are by far my favorite!  They are so crispy and put together with so many different elements- there are crunchy garlic bits, bacon, and it is all balanced out with pickled apples.  Never would I have thought to pickle apples!  It gives it a nice acidic balance to cut the fat and salt.  

We've always been lucky and have been seated right away, but we typically go at times that are a little bit off from ""normal"" dining times.  You can always get take out which is also worth it!

The first time we went on a Sunday night before Christmas and got in right away. The next time was a Friday at 2pm, and there were 15+ people standing outside waiting. We went to the Frite Shack instead (n.b.: poutine not as good there. Lacking in the gravy, confit, and cheese curd departments) 

Anyway, here's what we had:
Poutine - added confit and a duck egg. Came to $18ish, but totally religious food experience. So good!! Loved every bite. 
Cubano - pretty good but not worth $12 with no sides
Duckfat original milkshake - best milkshake I've ever had. Incredible. They also split it into 2 glasses for us which I really appreciated. 
Cotechino - they make in-house charcuterie now. This one wasn't to my personal taste (strong anise flavor) but it was objectively good

So my verdict: come here for a snack(poutine!) and a beer or milkshake, but skip a full meal. The sandwiches aren't worth it.

I tried the duck confit sandwich and one of the specials, the roast beef sandwich. The duck confit was super delicious. There was a good balance of flavors. Every bite was savory, sweet from the duck confit and acidic from the slaw. This was a perfect sandwich. The fries were also amazing! You get a choice of 1 sauce for the small order and 2 sauces for the large order. I tried the truffle ketchup because I love truffles! And truffles + fries are the perfect match.

This is not a good location for people with disabilities, the elderly or people who want normal type of seats. There are a couple tables outside the restaurant with normal tables and seating in an enclosed area where everyone enters/exits, which is not climate controlled. I did notice there is 1 tall table inside. (Could be another one. Unsure.)  I did not get to see the type of seating to that table. All other seating is a counter at a wall. My stool leaned back causing me to constantly slide back and it was on a corner towards the end. Not comfortable. They have hooks under the counters for bags/purses and wall hooks in the back for coats and yes, you do need that, because there's not enough room to put your stuff anywhere around you. May be worth waiting for one of the tables. You cannot go in and get a table without your entire party being present. Staff is very nice. The fries and sauces were very good. All of us had paninis. The bread was good, but I was not a fan of the pulled pork Cubano to a point that I just couldn't eat it. This does not mean you won't like it. Everyone has their own tastebuds. The BGT was ok. It's also important to point out that the paninis do not come with a side.

227,HdQr2QayY8pZAHM8fiG0mw,duckfat,227,2018-10-23,"Marked this place as a must on my trip to Portland, so was very determined to try food fried in duck fat that everyone seems so crazy about.
 
Stopped by on a rainy Friday around 4pm. The tiny place was jammed packed with a line outside. The wait time was over an hour. Decided to come another time, when there would be less people. Ha. Returned on Saturday around 2pm. The wait time for a table for two is 1.5-2 hours. TWO hours!! And everyone around the block is waiting for a table as well, so you know that wait won't magically shrink to 30 mins or even an hour. A lot of people ordered take out and created impromptu picnics on the grass right across from the restaurant. That's an option if you're pressed for time but resolute to try the food. My bf persuaded me to leave and not waste half our Saturday on waiting.

Despite so many futile attempts, I was resolute to make it to this local favorite before leaving back to NYC. Sunday morning, our last day in Portland, we arrived at 11am, right when the place opened. We were seated right away. FINALLY! Within half an hour, the place filled up to the brim. The restaurant is tiny, fits no more than 40 people at the time, and is insanely popular. If you don't want to spend over an hour waiting, recommend getting here right around opening time.
 
The ambiance is super casual, good for a quick and informal bite. Tiny space, so they tried to squish as many wooden tables as possible. Very loud noise levels. There's outdoor seating area as well.
 
The service is swift, warm, and welcoming. Everyone is super courteous despite the hustle and bustle of this tiny, overpacked place. Our waitress was very helpful with menu recommendations. Our food came from the kitchen at mega speed.

Now let's talk food. After all this wait and hype, my expectations were UP there. And have to admit that we left stuffed and content.
 
Large Fries ($8) come with two sauces. We got truffle ketchup and garlic mayo, which was solid, but everything fades in comparison to truffle ketchup--GET IT! The fries are a perfect golden color, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. My bf and I devoured everything to the last tiny fry.
 
Mocha milkshake ($6.75) was sinfully delicious. Made with local gelato, it was very smooth, not watery, rich, not too sweet.
 
Slow roasted Pulled pork panini ($12) with mustard pickles, swiss, and garlic-mustard mayo was my bf's favorite. Fail proof--if you like juicy, tender meat, go with this. Perfect flavor profile. Thoroughly enjoyed this delicious, sweet & savory combination.

Overnight Duck confit panini ($13.50) with spicy Asian slaw, miso mayo, cilantro was not as juicy as the pork cubano, but I still loved it. Delicious duck and great pairing with Asian slaw and miso mayo. Recommend trying this and the cubano. The paninis are cut in two, so you can share and try multiple flavors!
 
Doughnut holes ($7) served with caramel were tasty but simpler than anticipated. Brought out piping hot, so enjoy them while they're fresh and warm. Enjoyed the contrast of the crunchy shell and warm, fluffy filling.
 
Overall, really glad I persevered and had this experience despite crazy lines and wait time and advanced planning. Was worth the effort.",4.5,2,"['43 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.660206085231295,-70.2503810791679,"American (New), "
228,HdQr2QayY8pZAHM8fiG0mw,duckfat,228,2019-04-22,"Hipster place. Through and through. Take something everybody is familiar with and try and bring it to the next level. The one thing I will say positive about the fact that this is a hipster place is that they don't take themselves too seriously which is one of the biggest issues I have with hipster restaurants. 

Now I must say that nothing I had was bad. There was nothing that was inedible. But everything was mediocre. Except the fries but I will come onto that in a minute.  We started with the brussels sprouts which had some very interesting flavors and would have been very good except for the fact that they were halved instead of quartered them which in my case meant that the interiors were still nearly raw. And maybe that's what they were aiming for but I didn't care for it. I like the crispy outer layers and wanted a little bit more cooked in the middle, not mushy but cooked. Also eating half of a Brussel sprout at once can be a little difficult even if you got a large mouth like I do. 

On the fries. This was the highlight of the meal and what the restaurant is known for. Though personally I don't know if I have ever had bad fries cooked in duck fat. It was served with a choice of dressings and I chose horseradish and their Thai chili. Both were fine but nothing exceptional. The viscosity was a little lower than I care for but they weren't aiolis they were something else. 

Now on to the most problematic portion of the meal, the sandwiches. The other big highlight on the menu are the Panini's. I'm not convinced that these are traditional Panini's because they were dry as s---. I'm used to Panini's having some nice butter that helps caramelized the bread and these were just dry. Again I don't know if this is the what they were going for but I certainly didn't care for it and neither did my wife. She had the smoked ham on Rye which was fine but not great. But when you were spending $12 on the sandwich I think I want something better. Maybe our expectations were heightened because everybody talks about this restaurant but the sandwich was just mediocre. 

I took the recommendation of the server and got the duck confit. Again it was fine but not great and since it's the one she recommended and this is what restaurant is known for I really expected something else. When you spent $14 on an al a carte sandwich, mediocre isn't good enough for me.  There was something pickled on it which was nice I really enjoyed that flavor but it over powered everything else and again the bread was just dry. Not grilled, just dry. 

Couple of the notes about the restaurant, it's a hole in the wall place which is kind of fun except the fact that they set us at a community table, and I'm a big guy, next to another big guy which means we were touching shoulders the whole time. I don't have a problem sitting next to people I don't know but I don't want to be touching them the whole time. That's what airplanes are for. Another note is that they are on a wait all the time. That's not a problem for me I'm just pointing it out in case you need to eat quickly. Of course being on a wait actually can't be indicative of a good restaurant though in this case I feel like it was just in emperors new clothes situation.  I for one am not willing to say that I had a good meal just because I paid $46 for two sandwiches a basket of fries and a small plate of Brussels sprouts.",4.5,2,"['43 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.660206085231295,-70.2503810791679,"American (New), "

The place is very small and the parking situation around there sucks. Street parking and a garage that was almost full when we were there on a Wednesday around 2:30pm. There was around a 20min wait when we got there so we were given a buzzer and we walked around for a bit.

The place is very small so keep that in mind. They have a couple of larger high tops, a main bar and then some bar sitting along one of the walls. Probably not the best place for a large group.

Service was very good. Everyone from the hostess to our server were all very nice and explained some items on the menu for us.

They had a decent selection of local beers and a nice spritzer of the day. Both my beer and my girlfriends spritzer were great.

We started off with a small order of fries since we got the feeling this is what they were famous for. Didn't go for the poutine because we were having sandwiches and didn't want to get too full. Honestly the fries were good, but there wasn't any different or special about them. Just fresh good fries, but I guess I was expecting something different.

The sandwiches on the other hand were phenomenal! I've had a lot of pork sandwiches being from South Florida but their Cubano sandwich is one of the best I've had. My girlfriend got the special which was a haddock sandwich and that was also amazing. I love how they cut up the fish which makes the flavors blend in more and makes it easier to eat.

We finished off my sharing a chocolate milkshake. Also very good, not overly sweet with nice dark chocolate taste.

Don't get me wrong, the food here is really good!! we had the duck poutine, overnight duck confit panini, and sea salted caramel milkshake. The bread of the panini was something else...very toasty, not too heavy, and balanced nicely by the duck, Asian slaw, mayo and cilantro. The fries in the poutine were heavenly!!! Truly addicting as it had the perfect  crispness and seasoned heavily. The sea salted caramel milkshake was decadent, but a bit too caramel-y for my preference. 

...BUT a 40 minute wait for simple orders of paninis and poutine & only to eat our meal on a public bench right outside the restaurant makes it not worth the hype--even if the food is good. Granted, my opinion of this place might change if we had the opportunity to dine inside, but it seems like the sort of place where you'll feel too cramped in that tiny space and guilty for taking your time while there is a line of hungry people out the door.

Expectations define experiences, experiences define reality. I would say ""Expectations therefore define reality"" but this would be an equivocation fallacy. Wait... how did I start talking about logical fallacies... onwards ducklings. 

In terms of the wait, I must say if I had to wait 30-45 minutes, I would have left satisfied with the meal, but other than crossing it off my to-try list I would not 100% say the wait was worth it. 

Fries were very good, seasoned and cooked nicely. I will take them at their word that they're fried in duck fat, however, to be honest I didn't notice a difference between other really good fries. 

Speaking of fries, the sauce flight... for the most part very enjoyable. Except for the garlic mayo, the additives added a pleasant amount of flavor without taking everything over. My two favorites are the Curry and Thai Chili.

- Truffle Ketchup: Great, however since I make it at home occasionally, this was not as special. 

- Horseradish Mayo: What an interesting way to add some heat! Not overpowering by any means, unusual in a great way.

- Curry Mayo: Curry lovers rejoice! If you are a fan of this distinctly yellow spice, you will love this one!

- Thai Chili: This one brought a different, slightly stronger heat than the Horseradish, but still great even for those with low heat tolerance.

- Garlic Mayo - I think the ladle that filled my cup is a vampire. I looked and looked, tasted and tasted, and could not find the garlic in this one. 

Then there's the duck confit panini... 

The portion was more than filling, and unfortunately they can't do half-sizes. If you find it a little large, take it home or better yet, bring a friend! What I also liked is that they didn't skimp on the meat! The slaw added a nice fresh component too! Bread was grilled nicely, and not soggy or mushy in the slightest. 

However, this was far from spectacular. I would have liked for the meat to have a little more seasoning, as it was rather mild for my taste. As for the slaw, while I have no issues with its flavor, it was spread rather thin in places, and I would't call it spicy. Another thing that took my aback was that the sandwich was somewhat dry. They may have used miso mayo as indicated in the menu, but I don't recall seeing or tasting it (same with cilantro, but this isn't as big a deal in this case). 

To drink I had the All Maine Tonic... This was one of the most unusual sodas I've had in a while. Of all the flavors mixed in there, one of them was rather buttery! (in consistency, anyways). I am fond of the gentle level of sweetness, but the something didn't sit right. I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but there was a flavor that made this less-than-enjoyable. Looking back trough the menu, though I've not had it before, I don't think it was chaga (a kind of mushroom). My money's on vinegar being the culprit here. 

The service was nice, fairly quick, and surprisingly attentive. Seating is not just cafeteria style, but rather cramped as well. I was almost bumping elbows with my neighbors, but in a small place like this, space is at a premium, so I can't be too upset about it. Board with words you can arrange was cool too! My neighbors were far more creative than ""Wants more pesto beneath the lake."" This sentence is almost grammatically correct, but for the lack of a subject... because who would want pesto beneath a lake, and why?

The value is also not exceptional, especially when it comes to fries. I know duck is expensive, so I can understand the panini costing what it does. However, I got a rather small helping of albeit very good fries for $5.50.",4.5,2,"['43 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.660206085231295,-70.2503810791679,"American (New), "

We also got the turkey panini, and it was perfectly crisp, moist, and cheesy. As for drinks, we tried their Maine blueberry and buttermilk smoothie. It was delicious! We ordered 1, but they gave us some extra and split it into two cups so that we each had our own cup.

2) ""The Original"" Duckfat Milkshake - vanilla gelato w/ crème anglaise & fresh Tahitian vanilla bean

The most delicious thing wasn't even on the menu...they had a special blueberry and buttermilk milkshake that we couldn't not order. It tasted like a creamsicle but blueberry instead of orange.

I suggest getting the Poutine- you won't regret it and you won't leave hungry! It's not really an appetizer- you should consider it part of your dinner because it's dense. Also, ordering plain Belgian Fries is a good option since they come with their homemade sauces. I hate ketchup, but their Truffle Ketchup is to die for! Curry Mayo, too.

When you walk into Duckfat, it certainly has a European vibe, with tables put together in a very tight space. It's always pretty dark inside, but with some modern lighting, it gives it an easy coolness vibe. In the nicer weather, there are also benches placed outside for outdoor eating. 

I have been to Duckfat on multiple occasions, but I have yet to actually eat at their location. If you plan on going to Duckfat, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. Due to their small location and limited seating, this causes wait times to fill up fast, and they do not take reservations. Because of the close proximity and the boisterous atmosphere, I prefer not to eat at the location, because I typically like to relax while out to dinner, however, the take out is where it is at. Just the other night, I wanted myself some poutine and a duckfat shake, so I ordered to go, as I normally do. I was told that it would take about 15 minutes. When I went to go pick up my order, I was able to skip the large amount of people waiting to eat-in, and I left with my food in hand! So, if you are able to get the take out, DO IT, and go eat on the Eastern Prom...or in the comfort of your own home. 

The food that Duckfat offers varies from sandwiches, poutine, fries, and some charcuterie and other spreads, which again gives it that European vibe. I have only ever had the poutine, which is beyond amazing. With the Duckfat fries...it's definitely a heart-attack waiting to happen, but it is oh, so good. I may not have had their sandwiches, but they do look amazing, and I will be sure to get one on my next visit. 

Duckfat also provides some milkshake options. I tried the salted caramel duckfat milkshake, and it was an explosion of caramel. Between the duckfat and the salted caramel, the flavors are incredibly elevated to make for a sweet treat.

Duck panini. 
Hearty amount of meat. Great choice of bread. Crispy outside and tender on the inside.

This place specializes in duck fat fries two styles: plain with a specialty sauce or poutine. I ordered the poutine since there are such good reviews for it. They were incredibly salty, and the gravy left a lot of flavor to be desired. The fries were cooked well though and I think I would have enjoyed their regular fries more. 

We also ordered the meatloaf panini and duck confit panini. The panini bread was terrific in both--super crispy. The duck confit panini lacked flavor, and it was mostly just salty meat. The meatloaf was terrific, I would definitely order this again if I came back. 

The seating is limited, so it might be hard to get a seat at peak time. At some of their seats, there is a magnetic board with words so you can create some poems.

We shared some duck fries and brussel sprouts. The duck fries were good and came with your choice of dipping sauces, but it only came with 2 of them and you need to pay if you want to try the other sauces (though regular ketchup is free!). The fries were really good, but I couldn't tell anything special about them being fried in duck fat.  I got the butternut squash soup of the day and the leafy green salad.

We ordered: Belgian fries (famously fried in duck fat, obvs), roasted cauliflower salad, slow roasted pork cubano panini, meyer lemon curd milkshake, and some beer & wine (no liquor). Well, if you go here and don't get the fries then ya goofed hard. They're completely addicting, and I loved the truffle ketchup! I also highly recommend the cubano; the pork was so tender and savory.

We ended up in here by accident-- it's a long story but it involves me being stupid, and we were hungry enough to Just Do It (like Nike, except without the massive donations to Republican candidates mixed with disingenuous marketing to liberals).

We sat at the bar. There was some cold at our backs occasionally but no big deal because we had great coffee, signature fries with curry mayo (droooooooooooooooooolin'), and a meatloaf panini. I hated meatloaf when I was a kid. If you would've told me I would intentionally order meatloaf later on, I would've said, ""shut up crazy adult. I'm moving to Maine where I'm gonna be a fisherman and eat nothing that's meatloaf.""

It's so good it will convince your younger self to question all his food choices.

Also, if you sit at the bar, you can see rows of panini's getting made and it's like watching a fashion show.

Since it's so small, we ended up sitting at a bigger table with this couple we did not know. They were friendly so it wasn't awkward or anything (although it can be).

We got the duck salad, poutines with duck and egg, cubano and duck confit sandwich. The salad was a little too salty so it wasn't too enjoyable.

-Dipping sauces are great! The sauce flight is so worth it. My personal favorite was the truffle ketchup. 
-The duck salad is small, but tasty! The duck is seasoned well and very tender. Staff accommodated my dairy allergy by swapping the sour cream dressing for a sun dried tomato dressing!

  The best part of my meal was the bread and veggies.   Be warned that they don't have a kids menu, just smaller portions of two meals and a bowl of pasta.    So if you have a picky kid, don't bring them here.    I had a flank steak and brussel sprouts and my husband had a pork chop with mashed potatoes.

Getting a reservation is borderline impossible so your best bet is to go as a duo and try for a walk in. They reserve a third of their tables for walk ins although the wait is really long. We waited about 2 hours for our table but it was worth it in the end as this was one of the meals I have had a while.

When you walk in, you're immediately drunk off the intoxicating aroma of the burning wood stoves they use to cook most of their meats. So many items are wood grilled and the end result is you feel like you're sitting by a cozy campfire eating perfect food. Beyond that the candle light votives really enhance the ambiance of the restaurant. 

Once we sat down they brought us the house bread which is made by the bakery downstairs. The sourdough misch is incredible and it is the perfect tool to sop up all the juices from your meal. From there we had the warm foie gras lobe which was the duck liver lobe cooked to perfection. It practically exploded on your knife when you cut into it melting as you spread it on your bread. Everything about it was perfect. 

Our main course was the pork chop and the roasted chicken.  The pork chop was juicy, smokey, and supremely flavorful. This is a must get. With a side of the mashed potatoes,  the combination was a bit of heaven on earth.The grilled chicken was well prepared but lacking a bit on flavor, it could've used a smattering of garlic and fresh herbs to liven it up.

We finished the meal with the apple crisp and the walnut pie. The crisp was overly spiced with what resembles a deep cider flavor. The pie was excellent and it mimicked a pecan pie.

Food and service are top notch, so I'm glad this place was so-highly recommended. 

After my drink order was taken, I was started off with a plentiful basket of Standard Baking Co. (amazing bakery in Portland, which I believe own-affiliated with Fore Street, along with Scales and Street & Co.) sourdough bread, with ample creamy butter, salt, and pepper. 

I honestly don't quite recall what cocktails (2) I had, but they were delightful. 

For my first dish, I ordered the famed Wood Oven Roasted Maine Mussels in garlic almond butter and dry vermouth. Wow.

Second dish was the Wood Grilled Atlantic Squid with grilled napa, scallion, pea tendril, fermented red pepper aioli and carrots. OMG again. I don't know what it was, but this squid/calamari was just packed with so much flavor, it was unbelievable.

I've only heard of this town as a foodie Mecca by friends and relatives and now that my kid is at sleep away for two blissful weeks... it was time for us to food crawl through this quaint sea side town.... first stop Fore Street.

This old brick building sports what seems to be the original metal casement windows and once you enter, you can feel the warmth of a cozy, darkened dining room, ample bar and a bustling open kitchen.  We sat for a cocktail on the deep sofas in the bar area whilst they readied our table and the impression here is that whether you meet your many friends here, or you are gunning for a canoodling romantic dinner, you will be pleased!  I had a neat pour of Booker's with a side of ice and wifey chose from their cocktail offerings-- a Martini made with vodka, grapefruit, elder flower and a rosemary sprig.  Perhaps 14-16 bucks for this cocktail is not the greatest of values, but she enjoyed it nevertheless.

Benson was our waiter this evening and he navigated is through tonight's offerings which change daily and thoroughly as we learned.  The Menu is divided into courses of small plates that run the gamut from salads and soups to sea and land plates and then to an ample array of charcuterie.  We began with the heirloom carrot and pea salad and a charcuterie of pork terrine, chicken liver mousse, pickled lamb heart and tongue and the usual array of accompaniments.  When paired with their artisan bread this really could have been a meal on its own given the richness level.  Everything was stellar-- the greens were fresh and flavorful and the charcuterie scintillated with wonderfully gamey flavors and spices that matched up well with the jam and mustard as well as with the Tuscan red that Benson picked out for us.

Our mains were no less amazing-- wifey had the blue fish, fire roasted atop a tomato basil and duck fat potato mash and I had the ""medium"" hangar steak served with cippolini onions and mushrooms.  Benson convinced me that ""medium"" was the right call on this cut and thankfully, their version of medium was nice and pink.....We also enjoyed our sides of roasted cauliflower and squash.

For dessert we enjoyed a cheese course where we picked three of the 9 or so offerings and just like the charcuterie, they come arranges with the appropriate accompaniments such as almonds and and a house made jam to counter the gaminess.  The Triple creme Brie was the standout on this plate as it was a piquant blast of creamy heaven..... not something I usually get out of this type.

On the whole Fore Street was an amazing start to our foodie crawl as every course was expertly prepared and presented with fresh and semi local ingredients.  Great job guys and we look forward to our next ""Fore-ay"" here.... (sorry.... couldn't resist....)

Truly one of the best cooks on a lobster I've had....which makes sense since this is a top restaurant in Maine. It's soft and buttery, and the corn side was actually the best part of my meal. Super unique concept and a really fun texture. My dad ordered the lamb dish, and his lamb was VERY tough, so just be wary of that if you're considering that dish.

For dessert, I got the chocolate creme brulee. It was small but tasty. Not a bad way to cap off the meal.

Fore Street should probably get 5-stars if it was based on the food alone, but I see an issue with giving them that distinction after a really weird interaction I had at the restaurant. I, a 21-year-old, decided to order a cocktail which was advertised as blueberry and mezcal. I ordered the drink, and the waiter didn't ask to see my ID, but I assumed there wouldn't be any problems. I got my blueberry drink, and it was honestly pretty bad BUT it really didn't taste like alcohol at all. And I'm a lightweight and didn't even feel slightly tipsy. When the bill came we noticed that the drink was less expensive than advertised on the menu, and the waiter informed us that it was actually a MOCKTAIL, because he thought I was underage. Well, I could've shown you my ID if you were curious because I don't typically like drinking straight sodas.

Their menu changes every day -- I can't remember the exact names of everything we ordered, but I'll try my best. For appetizers, we got the SOFT SHELL CRAB which was pretty bomb. We also got this platter of chilled seafood -- it was unique but it wasn't that great. It was just five different samples of fish I believe. I got the SEA SCALLOPS and they were plated on top of different greens and I think some type of grain. Out of all the things I tried that night, the scallops were the best, in my opinion.

532,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,532,2018-09-03,"OMG.  Three letters are all that is necessary to describe an experience at Fore Street.  It's not every day that you come across an experience that transcends or alters your opinion of what something should be or has been for all your life.  Today, at Fore Street, that moment in time where you are given a choice, take the blue pill, which will ultimately lead to a blissful and safe but ignorant experience or take that red pill, the one that will free your mind, change your perception of reality, change untruths you've held dear from day one.

Morpheus (masquerading as my server this evening as David B.) steered me, Neo, towards that red pill and changed my perception of how good a pork chop can be forever.  Never before have I had a pork chop that wasn't over salted, fried, simmering in butter, or wrapped around some other fatty pork(pork belly) to add flavor or juiciness.  This pork chop needed none of that to be better than any other pork chop I've had.  This pork chop was tender and juicy, full of flavor, but not salty.  It was wrapped around this slightly sweet almost ketchup-y tomato gastrique, surrounded by absolutely perfect black trumpets, sweet peppers, corn and alliums which were plate cleaning licking awesome.  David's mild insistence that while that Hanger steak was going to be a great option as well, that this Pork Chop, cooked by that guy (he pointed to him) behind working the grill, was going to be the best Pork Chop ever.  Now I know how Neo felt when Morpheus gave Neo the freedom to choose and nothing will ever be the same.

If you ever get David,.... uhhh, Morpheus as your server, just listen to his suggestions.  Aside from this Pork Chop, he was spot on in regards to the Wood Grilled Longfin Squid and Wood Oven Roasted Mussels.  Before that Pork Chop entered my life, the Squid was going to be what I would have gushed about.  As it stands, this super tender squid will have to take a back seat.  Of the remaining items I tried this evening, the Foie Gras and Wild Mushroom & Grilled Corn Salad were amazing as well.

For dessert, the Nectarine Tarte and done.  Really.  Sweet and fresh sliced nectarines layered on top of a buttery crust and ultimately topped with ice cream.  All the desserts are insanely sized for like two or three.  

The entire experience was eye opening from the moment I sat down.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen area, right next to the wood burning oven, was the best seat in the house.  I was so close I felt like I was cooking tonight with all the heat that was generated by that oven.  Of all the dinners I've had in Portland, and there have been many, this has to be the dinner that tops all others.

Sadly with this knowledge that Pork Chop doesn't have to be dry and brined for hours, there is sadly one big issue, and that is I won't be able to replicate this Pork Chop myself or get to Fore Street often enough to enjoy.

We ordered two appetizers, the pork belly which is a portion about the size of a deck of cards for $15 and was pretty good. The sweetbreads app (also $15) wasn't my cup of tea. My friend really liked it, however. 

I ordered the flank steak as my entree, cooked perfectly and it was delicious. My friend ordered the duck cooked two ways which comes with breast and a duck leg. I ate some of the duck breast and it was delicious! The entrees don't really come with sides, you have to order them separately. We ordered garlic mashed potatoes and fingerling potatoes. Both were delicious and I would order them again ($8 each and they are shareable portions). The entrees cost about $35 and up.

We wanted everything, but settled on the mussels (heavenly sauce, no grit, and yes, I confess we saw it on television), lamb sausage with cornmeal cake which arrived looking something like a street taco but not tasting like anything you could grab on the corner, roasted chicken that was tender and crispy, although maybe a little too salty, the hanger steak which had that lovely flavor you only get from cooking over an open fire and that melting tenderness which meant that cow must have exercised less than me, and a shared side of creamy butter with a little bit of potato mashed in to keep it on your fork.

Patrick, our waiter, was busy but gave us good service, and other than the salty chicken the only complaint I had was a little indigestion after, for which I blame our menu choices.

538,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,538,2018-08-18,"After a few visits into town - and forgetting to make a reservation in advance - we decided that we'd hit up Fore Street via the walk-in line and grab a meal before heading back to the airport. We arrived around 4:20 PM, and we were the only folks there for about 10-15 minutes on Sunday...for future reference, coming for a walk-in spot at 4:45 PM would be more than okay IMO. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the kitchen does not actually open until 5:30 PM - so if you are under the gun for time (like we were), you'll probably do what we did and end up eating dinner at the bar. It's plenty nice enough - a view of a classy, well-stocked bar full of liquor never gets old - but it doesn't quite compare to how the dining room looks, with its high ceilings and wooden slats marrying the industrial feel of the brick building the restaurant is housed in with a more rustic sensibility. That said, we were serviced pretty quickly at the bar and had plenty of time to spare when it came to making our flight - so no complaints there. The drink selection is what you'd expect - a handful of local ales - and the cocktail I had was pretty good as well.

The food here is excellent overall, and it's easy to see why after all these years, it is still the standard-bearer for the Portland food scene. For starters, though - the sourdough served here (unsurprisingly from Standard Baking, which is in the lower half of this building) is excellent. We started out with a few appetizers, with the oysters being the first served - a nice selection of local oysters that showcased some of the subtle differences in salinity and finishes. The mussels were excellent, and I really enjoyed the garlic almond butter giving the broth something a bit creamier and nuttier relative to a standard white wine sauce. Our last appetizer was the seasonal salad, which was light but not necessarily distinguishable in any way...definitely the least memorable dish. Then it was on the entrees, both of which were delicious. The half chicken I ordered was ridiculously good, with the honey brine giving the skin a vaguely sweet flavor that mixed so well with the natural juices from the meat. It's a ton of food, so be forewarned...but this was definitely a can't-miss dish from my view. My wife went with the poached lobster with corn, and while the corn preparation was a bit on the sweet side, the lobster was prepared to perfection. We then finished up with a very seasonal dish that was a lot of fun to eat - a mixture of large and small blackberries (I forget the proper terminology here), served with lemon curd and brown sugar for dipping. It's simple, not overly sweet, and a perfect way to end a meal at this restaurant in particular.

Although we didn't get a chance to make it here in the past, I am glad that we came, and whenever our next trip is, I will need to remember to book a reservation in advance so we can sit in the dining room! With a rotating menu - but with some favorites (like the half chicken and mussels) always on the menu, there is going to be something new - or an old favorite - to enjoy.

Staff was knowledgeable and great. Only snafu for us is that with our 8 month old baby, as there are no highchairs or accommodations for kids, it was slightly difficult to eat peacefully. But, maybe that is on purpose?

It is pretty basic from the outside - I walked by during the day and didn't notice it but once you walk in and the smell of the open wood burned envelops you - well I knew I was in a happy place.  We arrived early - like way early because it was raining and took a seat at the bar - Fore Street not only has great food the bar is excellent as well - can't get Allagash back home so kept it simple and my wife went one of the specialty cocktails with beet juice and was very happy - especially after the second.  Was called well before our reservation time (thanks) and a quick note - you should make a reservation as far in advance as possible)  Fore Street is intimate with exposed brick and wood with dim but not dark lighting.  The restaurant not only has an open kitchen, the prep area is in the wide open with a massive basket of fresh bread on view as you walk to the table with staff preps out salads, etc. - our table didn't look into the kitchen and it doesn't appear they have a chef table but would like to just watch them work.  So about the food - started with oysters - we live in the mid-west and super fresh isn't an option so local oysters are a treat and these were so fresh and delicious the mignonette was not necessary and in most places the oysters would have been the pre-entree highlight but then there was the sauteed squid with mushrooms - it appears that it is not always on the menu but if it is do not hesitate - just cooked through tender squid matched with sliced mushrooms was amazing.  Also ordered a fettuccine app - kind of weird as an appetizer but house made pasta in a light white wine sauce was kind of fantastic - just didn't see it coming.  So after three pre-dinner snacks listen to our waitress and order the Halibut steak served with potatoes in a ripping hot (their term) tiny cast iron skillet - it was a porcelain white inch thick piece of fish just cooked through that accentuated the fish spectacularly.  My wife also took the recommendation of the Scallops cooked with navy beans and sweet black rice with slices of white radish - I would have never considered that combination but now can't imagine them any other way.  So three apps, two entrees - no way dessert was happening - until the warm cherry rhubarb cobbler - with cinnamon basil ice cream - are you out of your mind - forget everything else that happened - Fore Street would get 5 stars just on the dessert.  We actually discussed trying to get back in the next night - I would not go to Portland with eating at Fore Street and neither should you.  Bonus for eating at Fore Street - your sweater will smell like roasty wood for several days - I actually picked mine up from the suitcase when I got home and relived the experience.",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

Luckily, the hostess got us at the bar when there was a last-minute cancellation. SCORE!

I know the menu changes on a daily basis, but they have standard items and I just thought it was weird when the waiter said he doesn't have any idea of how anything tasted. 

How does he not know how the standard plates tastes. and I know restaurants that offers a tasting to their waitstaff before serving time, so they are able to speak to the dishes.

It wasn't like that here. but our waiter Benson said everything was good here.

I am always reluctant to order mussels because a lot of places doesn't cook them properly. I asked him and he advised that they were good.

When the mussels arrived, they were huge and I have never seen them of that size.

I tasted them and I was just like grossed out by the texture and this is coming from an Asian. I can eat Uni, roe, sea cucumber and etc, but I just couldn't stomach this fluffy, super soft, and mushy type of mussels.

I called the waiter over and advised that the mussels tasted overcooked, but he advised the mussels supposed to take like this because of the type of mussels that are from Maine. He said it was because I am used to PEI mussels, but I am thinking I had moules from France, and mussels in Asia and Australia and I doubt they are all PEI mussels, since it wouldn't make sense for them to get them from Canada. But none of those oysters tasted like these mussels here.

The two tables next to us ordered mussels as well and I was dying to hear their thoughts, and the table to my left, had Benson as our waiter and when they ordered the mussels, he didn't mention anything to them in terms of size or anything after I complained about the texture.

The table to my right had a different waiter and he didn't mention anything either, but I wasn't there to witness the table to the left. however, I got to see the people's reaction on my right.

I saw the guy taking a bite of the mussels and he put his fork down and didn't say a word. He didn't reach for more, but his dinner partner took more mussels and ate them without a pause.

She raved about them, but he just nodded and as I observed, each time he took a mussel, he would chase it with his beer.

When their waiter came by, he asked how everything was going, and the guy said, these mussels are ""fluffy"" and big. 

Their waiter didn't mention anything about being the characteristic of this certain type of mussels, but he said the reason why they are bigger is because it is their spawning season.

I would definitely had appreciate if our waiter gave us this insight before ordering mussels and not lie and tell me it is because it's due to the Maine's mussels.

Everything else besides the mussels incident and our waiter were great!",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

Dessert was decadent, delicious, and delightful. I got the chocolate fudge torte and my boyfriend got the vanilla layer cake.

My girlfriend and I were there for a birthday celebration. Both our entrees were a disaster. She ordered halibut, which came out virtually raw. I ordered lamb, which was tough as shoe leather and extremely difficult to cut. I noticed that the woman seated next to me also ordered lamb and was having trouble cutting it. I also noticed that her presentation was entirely different than mine, even though we ordered the same dish. When I inquired to our waiter about that, he said that the kitchen places the entrées into whatever dish is available, so people get different presentations. Seriously? A $40 entrée and that's what you do?


By the time we finally finished our entrees, after I switched to chicken and my girlfriend's halibut was sent back and returned still not really cooked through, we were too disgusted to order dessert. 

Most telling was that our waiter and the hostess both apologized profusely, but only our $12 app was comped. No offer even of a glass of wine.

574,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,574,2017-12-14,"I REALLY wanted to give Fore Street five-stars. All of the reviews here are so amazing that I thought for sure I would have an equally exceptional experience, but I think this is a solid 3-3.5 star restaurant.
The food is very good, but it is not GREAT. We split two appetizers- a pork belly appetizer and the mussels. While the mussels were delicious (especially with a crusty piece of bread to sop up the sauce they are in), the pork belly really lacked in flavor, and was very tough to chew. Entrees were the half chicken and a duo of duck. Both were very flavorful, and no complaints on the execution of the cooking, but I just do not believe that the taste comes close to justifying the price of this meal.

Based on the a\\experience above, I would typically award this restaurant 4 stars, not 3. However, the entire time we were there we felt extremely put-off by our waitress. I don't know how to explain the vibe that she was sending, but it almost seemed like she thought we were going to try to run out on our bill? I'm not sure if we looked ""too young"" to be able to afford such an ""expensive"" meal (we are both almost 30), but I didn't appreciate being made to feel like we were somehow beneath the quality of such a prestigious establishment.
And not that it matters, but we were both dressed more than appropriately for the location (skirt/blouse for me, blazer/slacks/button-down) for my fiance. 

My advice to management would be to retrain the staff to respect the patrons more, and avoid the snooty, entitled attitudes.",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

I was lucky enough to get a reservation here with only two weeks notice, barring it wasn't the ideal time my family wanted, but we are very glad we got to eat here.

I could write the longest review ever for this place, but i'll keep it as short as I can.

We ordered a lot, almost too much between the six of us, but every single dish impressed.  I mean, every, single, dish...  There was nothing we ordered that we went ""that was just okay"", every dish was delicious, and fresh.  This really stays true to it's farm-to-table credo, and you can see it in the menu as it changes often as well.  The place itself is beautiful too, and they had a good beer and bourbon selection, I got my EH Taylor Barrel Proof!  

The big thing was the pacing of the food was great too, there were never more then 2-3 dishes on the table at a time.  Dinner was about 2-2.5 hours, and it didn't feel rushed or slow, was perfect.  This place fits in my Top 5 places that i've ever ate at.

I've never had mussels as good as the ones from Fore Street and the chicken is magical.

When we arrived they did not seem too busy. They quoted us 30 minutes which was fine by me. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. The bartenders were a bit rude and pretentious! I told them that we were waiting for a table, or even 2 seats at the bar if they opened up. A few minutes later, one of the bartenders came over to us and said that it will be longer than 30 minutes since they forgot about a couple that was ahead of us. So, I finished my drink, spoke a few words to them letting them know how I felt about the situation and we left. All they had to do was accommodate us too for their mistake. I would have accepted an apology too or better yet a gift card. We all make mistakes, but if they tried to make up for it, I wouldn't be giving them 3 stars.

This was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. It bursts in your mouth with unmatched flavor and phenomenal texture. It's like an experience. Unbelievable! 

My only critique, however, is that the foie gras was a bit undercooked. Came out lukewarm, not seared long enough. It's an easily reparable faux pas, we could have sent it back to have them cook it longer.

My wife had the Heritage Pork Leg Steak with sweet potatoes purée and collard greens. 

I ordered the Hanger Steak medium rare. The steak looked perfectly cooked, but I took one bite it was room temperature at best. I informed the bartender, and he offered to have it warmed up for me. I declined as I didn't want the steak to come back overcooked.

- Wine list met expectations.  
- Absolutely awesome atmosphere.  Casual with wood-fired lighting and a consistently delicious aroma throughout the restaurant.  

What needs improvement:
- Service was very slow with bread taking multiple tens of minutes to be delivered when empty on two different occasions.  Server quite disengaged.

I was told Portland has an amazing food scene and it did not disappoint. 

That said, there were a couple of places that stood out the most above the others; this was one of them.

We came here for Sunday early breakfast before heading back to VT. We were shocked to see how many enthusiastic early morning diners there were and that there was already a 35 minute wait at 9am. Not to worry-we like great food enough to chill and wait our turn for some amazing grub.

The hostess was super nice and made sure my s.o. and others had coffee while we waited. A couple of chairs opened up at the bar and we were glad to take them when offered. Willie G, our server and bartender du jour was great. When he wasn't mixing up drinks for the servers and serving food to other bar guests, he took the time for a friendly chat. 

As we knew we had along drive and the menu just looked too good to behave, we ordered a smoked salmon eggs benedict for me, a canadian bacon one for him, and we split a breakfast special: banana brad french toast with bananas, chocolate syrup, whipped cream and powered sugar. Um yeah, we were being piggies, but it was so worth it.

I also ordered a mimosa, which came in a large pint glass generously filled with champagne and then a nice dose of OJ. I got a hot chocolate as well which came in a large handled mug with whipped cream. Both were fantastic. 

The eggs...now, I am fairly an aficionado of eggs benedict. So when I say these were hands down the best I have ever eaten, it's no joke. The Hollandaise was so light and airy with a touch of lemon and a teensy hint of heat that I could have ordered just that and bread to dip in. The smoked salmon was of a very high quality. Seriously good eats. The s.o. said the same.

The banana bread french toast was to die for. We took half of it home to not overindulge and to allow a proper second tasting.

It was pricey breakfast, but well worth it IMO. I have no issue shelling out money for excellent food and service. 

I'm sure we will visit his family again here, so I definitely want to come back here for lunch and dinner in the future.

With 2 kids under age 3, it seemed better to have both high chairs outside as the interior seems quite small. On a weekend during brunch, it is rather quickly crowded and it was a nice enough day.

The prices were on the higher end of what I consider a nicer brunch...so 10-15 per person with more elaborate or specialized dishes only found during brunch or as daily offerings.

We ordered a round of drinks, I had the Cajun bloody which was spicy and awesome. The garnish is pickled green beans, okra, and olive. A total flavor sensation.  My partner and friend had mimosas, which came in a pint glass... score!  

Our food was phenomenal.  The Cubano sandwich and the Mother Clucker were decadent and SO filling.  The Mother Clucker is an open faced chicken on a biscuit as gravy with fresh green onions on the gravy.  We also had a red/green burrito and a side of fried green tomatoes. Those were Oh So good.

Hot Suppa does its best to bring southern food to the northern states, with middling results. My boyfriend and I split the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with gravy and blueberry waffles. Though he loved the chicken sandwich, I wasn't a fan - the coating was soggy, the gravy was mediocre, and the hash browns weren't crispy. Also it was all white meat, so pretty dry. The bluberry waffles were SUPER thin (which I actually liked better), and the sauce/whipped cream was pretty delicious. Waffle itself wasn't anything special, though.

The wait for a Saturday night around 730 wasnt bad at all.  Got seated for a table of 3 and the server was very attentive to us right away.

Ordered the charbroiled oysters, also ordered the $1.50 oysters (right!?!? 1.50?!?!) and the 3 of us ordered the friedchicken, as it was the most popular choice).  I was SUPER TEMPTED to order the nashville fried chicken because of the VERY HOT, YOU TRY ON YOUR OWN RISK spicy warning but i was also scared.

The server offered to have the sauce on the side for a buck more, which i happily comply with.  For my side, i ordered the shirmp, corn gumbo

Ok lets start with the oysters - now now, lets not start a yelp storm, BUT...it was my first time having it -_-, so does my review count?  YES!  The charbroiled ones were delicious, with that garlic butter and parm...OMGGGOODDNESSS...why are you delicious.  Then i had my raw oyster...i mean...for a 1.5, if i didnt like it...it didnt hurt my wallet.  It was a bit more on the sweeter end but i have to say...it wasnt my favorite (cause i dont like the texture)

Ok...enough already - to the main course....my CHICKEN.  So sidenote - i was a bit upset that my friend got like an extra piece of chicken (3 in total) and i only got 2, wth?!  Anyways, so here is my chicken, i believe one was thigh and one was breast.  The skin was crispy and flavorful, not thin crispy though.  The chicken meat itself...could have use a bit more love with some seasoning..i felt like it could have seep in a bit more.  The chicken, i do have to say...was moist and not dry.  I had a hard time finding the meat in one of my piece so i was a bit sad.  
The gumbo soup was a bit disappointing...i felt like it was a bit on the lighter side where as the gumbo texture is much thick and rich.  I even tried adding the nashville hot sauce to it to see if it would taste (dont do it!)

ONTO my main point - the nashville sauce...to be honest, it is spicy...like shit does kinda hurt...BUT BUT BUT! the part that im upset about it....it is nasty bitter...it has nothing but bitter and burn, so it was not enjoyable! Can you imagine if i have gotten my fried chicken covered in that?! I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED!!

We waited around 7-10 minutes for a table. Breakfast & lunch is served until 2pm. At 2, doors are locked and new customers are not allowed. Usually, the place is packed, so your best bet is to arrive like we did, an hour before closing. 

The atmosphere is casual. Large, wooden furniture. Modern and classical hits playing on the radio. Cozy atmosphere. Pleasant to relax over a friendly chat. Not a lot of spacing, so not suitable for large parties.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. Service is quick, so nothing to remark on there.
 
We were starving, so were super ready for some rockin food based on stellar reviews and our Airbnb host's recommendations. What we got was underwhelming.

My bf got the soup (with shrimp) with grilled cheese ($9). Tiny cup of soup and a small sandwich. Not filling for anyone, especially a man. The soup was hearty and slightly spicy, solid flavor, no complaints. Wish the portion was bigger. Grilled cheese was nothing spectacular. 

I got corned beef hash ($17), which was the establishment special. The waitress highly recommended it so of course I had high expectations. Per waitress's suggestion, ordered it with hollandaise (which they make in house) on the side. The tiny paper cup was an additional $2 charge, which was a bit pricey. Hollandaise was delicious, no complaints there. Very creamy and light. Per recommendation, got the grits instead of hash. Regretted that decision. Grits were very watery and I couldn't eat much of it. Corned beef itself was well cooked, but nothing special, probably the most forgettable I've ever had. The portion comes with two eggs any way. I chose eggs Benedict. Huge disappointment. Eggs were stale and flavorless. Probably the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had. Overall, the entire dish was a let down. Expected so much more. Especially for $19, which is a dinner restaurant price for a plate, not for a simple breakfast egg dish. You can find much better for a better price.

Hearing about the southern style flair that Hot Suppa provides on their brunch menu, I was excited to check out all of the goodness. 

As everyone has stated in other reviews, the long waits and lines are not a myth. My husband and I have come a couple times when the wait has been over an hour long. However, sometimes you can hit the restaurant at a decent time (8-9:30am) and only wait about 30 minutes. The restaurant is very small and has limited seating, so sometimes sitting at the bar gets you in a little quicker. 

In a recent trip, I decided to try their famous bloody mary, which had a nice kick to get the day going. Probably one of my favorite bloodies in Portland. One of my friends ordered the maple latte, which was also really good. I ended up ordering the fried green tomato egg benedict, because benedicts are just amazeballs and fried green tomatoes? Why not?! The eggs were cooked to perfection, the tomatoes, flavorful, and the hash browns are cooked crispy and delicious. 

So the food and drinks are great...so why the four stars? First off, as I have stated, the place gets super busy, which I get can be overwhelming and sometimes frustrating. But each time I have come, the hostess has always been rude and uninviting. I would get one day being a little ""off"" but it has been consistent every time. It's just a little off putting. However, the wait staff is always accommodating and nice. Secondly, I find that many of their options are very over-priced. I don't mind putting down some cash for a great brunch, but I found some of their prices were extensive.

Pros:
* Surprisingly short wait for a Friday night. They were able to sit a 6 person party in about 20 minutes. We called ahead to get an idea of what the wait was like.
* Small cute restaurant. 
* Food was okay. Tried the falafel sandwich which... Well, it tasted really fresh and healthy because it had a LOT of chopped lettuce, but also that means it had a very small amount of falafel in it. Roasted beet salad was pretty good. 
* Good local beer selection. Mostly leaning IPA, as they tend to these days.
* We waaaay overstayed our welcome and they didn't make us feel that way at all. We were catching up and didn't realize the restaurant had closed. That was really nice of them, although of course I wish we hadn't been the extra burden.


Cons:
* No personal experience, but a friend who researched workers' rights in Amherst a couple of years ago shared that the owner didn't treat workers well.",4.5,2,"['703 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.653044924140005,-70.2684836089611,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Comfort Food, "

We got bottomless coffee and shared the fried chicken and waffles special and the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs sunnyside up (both were DELISH!)

The total was ~$15/person which is not bad at all for brunch in Portland. Plus it was sooooo much food, I took leftovers home for another full meal.

Started with a Maine maple latte, they don't have soy milk here but substituted with almond milk and was still very delicious!

Tried their famous corn beef hash and it did not let me down! This was hands down the best corn beef hash I have ever had! Not too salty, real meat, pressed on a griddle to perfection.

While visiting Portland with my wife and 4-month-old son, we picked this placed based on reviews and were quite impressed.  We were able to get in quickly and the service was excellent.  We ordered several things to share.  We got a few oysters (they were only $1.50 each so why not), the poutine, the catfish tacos, shrimp and grits, and the Fried Chicken with Mac and Cheese.

The Oysters were really good!  They tasted fresh and the housemade cocktail sauce was absolutely delicious.  And since my wife does not like oysters, I got these all to myself :):):)

The Catfish Tacos were amazing.  Having never eaten catfish before I really don't know what it should taste like, but if it tastes like that I WANT MOOOOOOREE!!!

The poutine was a little disappointing to me.  Having grown up in Canada and being a little bit of a food snob, I may be being a little bit harsh, but poutine is near and dear to my heart and I feel like I have to defend it.  But then, I did order a Canadian classic at a southern soul food place so what can I expect.  I just felt like the gravy needed more seasoning, so still not a bad choice.

The shrimp and grits were good, but they were not what I was expecting.  The sauce/gravy that was on the shrimp tasted quite tomatoey, which was strange to me.  It was seasoned kinda like a tomato vegetable soup, but again, since I have never had shrimp and grits before I can't be super harsh on this.  The shrimp was cooked very well and still tasted great!

The Mac and Cheese was the star of the night. It was delicious! (For the one bite I got to taste).  I had ordered my piece of fried chicken in the Nashville Hot seasoning, and while it tasted super good and I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was so hot that I could not taste anything else.

I had initially tried to come on Thursday however the wait was over an hour and my hunger could not wait that long. When we came back this weekend the wait was about 35 minutes, which was reasonable given the popularity of this place and the limited seating available.

I have to say, my biggest turn off about this place was the hostess. Super unfriendly. She was there both times I came and each time was just as unfriendly. When you try to put your name in, she has a way of making you feel like you are inconveniencing her and whenever she gives a wait time it almost seem like she gives longer wait times in hopes of having you leave. Definitely not a good first impression.

The restaurant itself is super cute. There is nice art on the walls and it has a very homey/diner feel. The seating is super limited which certainly doesn't help the wait times.

The menu was decent and offered a variety of options. Prices were a little expensive in my opinion. I got a Bloody Mary and the Biscuit and Gravy for my meal.

The Bloody was tasty, but not my favorite. It was garnished with an olive, green been, and okra which I thought was rather odd.

The meal was really quite good. The gravy and biscuit were both delicious and the hash browns on the side were also excellent.

Many remarked the venue is popular hence the excessive delay in getting seated, which I experienced and found off-putting,  Since they do not take reservations I was stuck waiting for nearly an hour with my guests when I was there last.  That is way too long.  Therefore keep this in mind as you will wait if you go to Hot Suppa for breakfast on the weekend; I cannot speak for weekdays.

Generally speaking the food at Hot Suppa is good.  Is it extraordinary as some would say?  No, I do not think so; yet ""good"" in any restaurant carries weight from my perspective.

Hot Suppa is pricey.  Once upon a time Portland had a vastly different demographic that would not support the prices many venues charge today.  Pursuantly, Hot Suppa is supported by people who have the means to pay their prices for their meals.  Just keep this factor in mind if Hot Suppa is on your radar screen.

I would go back and try Hot Suppa for dinner out of curiosity.",4.5,2,"['703 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.653044924140005,-70.2684836089611,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Comfort Food, "

After a 20 minute or so wait, we ended up seated at the bar. The bartender was so friendly and the Saturday morning jams were a perfect way to start my day.

I get it. I get why people wait! First, the bloody mary. It was just what I look for in a bloody. A good punch of spice (without killing your taste buds) and the perfect drink snacks - pickled dilly beans and okra. It was equally good without vodka. Second, the food. To eat, I had one of their specials - pork with tomato gravy, over cheesy grits with the most perfect biscuits. Oh! And two perfect poached eggs! My husband devoured his (yes, we got the same thing), but I was conscious to savor every bite (so unlike me). It was one of those times where I was actually very sad that I couldn't finish my plate.

Wait was 25ish minutes (9am on a Wednesday), which we were fine with. Took a while to get our order in and food, but we understand it was busy and whatnot. Our server was nice. No complaints there, just understanding that restaurants get busy!

I ordered an eggs benedict, subbed with normal bacon and hashbrowns. My boyfriend ordered the omelette with bacon and American cheese, hashbrowns and wheat toast (no pictures, sorry).

I am a huge eggs benny fan and I was extremely unimpressed. The english muffin was barely toasted, bacon was chewy, hollandaise was sparse and too lemony. The poached eggs were fine. I had an extremely tough time cutting through the eggs benedict because of the english muffin. It felt lukewarm when I started to eat it, like it had been sitting out for a bit. Usually a place nails at least a couple components for me but I felt like only the poached egg was decent on this one. 

His omelette was quite small for $13 or so, and there was just one piece of toast cut in half. The filling was decent (I tried it and liked it). 

The hashbrowns on both our plates were deliciously crispy on the outside but the inside was mushy and flavorless. There was a big serving of hashbrowns, however we didn't finish them even though we usually really like anything potato related!

We're not picky people (especially my BF) so it's strange for us to leave a place completely disappointed. Maybe we caught an off day?",4.5,2,"['703 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.653044924140005,-70.2684836089611,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Comfort Food, "

The cocktail menu was very interesting with unique flavors that I don't find in most craft cocktails. I went with a Violet Fizz and unfortunately found it to be too overpowering on the violet and I love the flavor of violet. My husband's Congo Square Zombie was very good. 

We started with Deviled Eggs. Three were bacon and three were sriracha. Both were delicious and we just loved this appetizer. I had the Fried Chicken with Sweet Potatoes as a side.

We all enjoyed our food (my friends got the biscuit and sausage gravy, fried green tomato and eggs benedict, and waffle plate) and our server was really nice, but I have definitely had better breakfast food. Nevertheless, it was a great start to our day-trip in Maine.   

By the time we left around 10 AM, we overheard that the wait time for even a two-person table was at least 30 minutes.

Chicken & Waffle: 5/5 OMG OMG OMG!!!! Best Waffle I have EVER had in MY LIFE!!!! I can just eat a whole stack of their waffles. And the fried chicken is crispy and so flavorful~ This is a must have coming here.

Deviled Eggs: 4/5 Both Sriracha & Bacon flavors are really good. The only thing is that the egg din't taste really fresh. You get the tastes that it's been in the fridge for a while...

Hot Cat: 5/5 Spicy version of Shrimp & Grit plus a cat fish. It's well seasoned and not crazy spicy. I would recommend people to try it but definitely go for Chicken & Waffles as top choice

Roasted Cauliflower: 3/5 It's very lightly breaded and I don't know what they put but it's sour??! I just think that it would be a lot better if this is not sour....made it kind of weird tasting

Zombie: 4/5 It's not too sweet yet full of pineapple flavor but I can't really taste the alcohol in it? still I prefer Zombie over Afterglow

Afterglow: 3/5 I like the kick from the jalapeno but the passion fruit juice made the whole drink kind of thick...too little alcohol is the problem I would say

Buttermilk Pie: 4/5 It's light and not too sweet. The crust reminds me of Taiwanese Pineapple cake, which is pretty interesting

743,8D39iKzQXQqDofh0Xx9dxQ,the-thirsty-pig,743,2018-05-11,"A must do in Portland if you are into gourmet hot dogs and sausage links! This place is also great if you are looking for a more reasonably priced meal. Most of the other restaurants are on the fancier and more expensive side. 

We tried to look for a place with lobster but all the restaurants had 'market price' for the lobsters which, since it was off season, it meant the prices would be pretty steep. Plus we already had plenty of lobster the days before so we were good.

There are so many sausage choices! In addition, there are also lots of choices for premade hot dogs. I was pleased to see that the hot dogs were all beef so I decided to order one of those.

I ordered the chili bomb, which is basically a chili dog, and my husband ordered the Chicago dog. Instead of a hot dog bun, the restaurant serves the dogs on a delicious and perfectly toasted slice of bread. I loved the chili dog and my husband liked the Chicago dog except that he is used to having it on a traditional poppy seed bun but other than that it was perfect! 

We ordered a side of hummus to share and it was also pretty good. We were actually still hungry so I recommend to pay the $13 to mix and match 2 types of hot dogs. We ended up buying and sharing a third hot dog. We went with the flavor of the month, which was a Mexican street corn hot dog complete with seasoned corn, tortilla chips, and mayo. It was delicious! 

Heads up you can enter on 2 sides of the restaurant. We entered on the main street side with booths and tables but there is also a back patio area where people enter from the alley on the other side. This kinda creates a problem because no one knew where to stand in line. There was just one big crowd of people. Fortunately, the orders are taken pretty quickly so if you accidentally cut in line or someone cuts in front of you, everyone puts their order in within a quick amount of time.

There's plenty of outdoor seating (esp for Portland which seems to have chronically tiny seating) in a nook of the Old Port. Additionally, the menu is meat-tastic. A wide variety of sausages are available and all of them tasty. 

On our visit today, two of us got hot dog baskets (a pair of Shields Meats' natural casing hot dogs locally made in Kennebunk) and one of us got the Lithuanian kielbasa. All of it was cooked well and paired great with the cider and beer of choice. 

The buttered split toasted bun was the delightful vehicle to deliver these sausages to our mouths. Not too dark, not too light--a terrific complement to our meats. 

Those housemade pickles were sweet and TART AF. My face screwed up as the flavor went from sweet to tang and made me crave an entire bucket of them. So unexpectedly bright and lively in flavor. 

Is $9 expensive for two good hot dogs? Maybe, but Five Guys charges $4.50 a hot dog and they aren't locally sourced or as flavorful. 

At the end, we were still peckish and ordered the pub pretzel. The pub cheese wasn't my style, but I did enjoy the mustard. This pretzel had the ideal coating of pretzel salt--no bite went without. Not my absolute favorite pretzel in town, but it certainly earned the right to be ordered again in the future.

- the ambience. It's cozy, it's not pretentious. It's welcoming. The servers are kind.
- the BEER. Oh. EM. Gee. They always have something on tap for everyone. They almost always have a delicious Bissell on tap, which is my go-to. They have wines too - beer and wine only.
- the old school card trivia. I cannot even count the number of times I have sat in this bar or on the patio with my bf and with friends quizzing each other on random facts of the 1950s. It's free, cheap fun.
- the bathrooms. IDK about the men's room, but the ladies' room is nicer than my apartment, tbh.
- the patio rULES. In the summer, the green vines reach up, you're secluded - it feels like a true Maine experience. In the winter they used to have the patio open with the heating things - not sure that's still happening. If not, they should bring it back.
- the food - they serve mainly sausages, but serve a vegan sausage too! Can I get a YAS. Their pretzels rule.

The only time I despise this place is when it's filled to the brim with screaming drunk bros that can't hold their alcohol and crash into you as you're waiting in line for a drink. That is not great. But, it's in the OP. What do you expect, I guess?

The line can get long here. That's not great either. Plan accordingly.

I came here on Christmas, as it was one of the only places open, and I do not regret it. It was fab. This is a true Portland bar.",4.0,2,"['37 Exchange St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.657146,-70.25403179999999,"American (Traditional), Bars, Beer, Wine & Spirits, "

We both ordered beers, which were tasty, but I had to remind the bartender to pour them because she had forgotten.

I had 2 Icelandic hot dogs for lunch. I'll tell you, I have been to the famous hot dog cart in Reykjavik and these hot dogs are nothing like those. They were decent but very oversauced. Far too much ketchup and mustard. Far too much remoulade which doesn't resemble the sauce used in Iceland. And the fried onions weren't flavorful enough. Very messy to eat.

My BF had the kielbasa which didn't taste at all like a kielbasa. It was also overdressed and had some odd spices in it which gave it a weird flavor. Just wasn't what was expected from the description. 

The environment is still nice but there were about 100 wasps flying around the ivy next to the patio. Made me nervous as I'm deathly afraid of bees. I was a bit on edge due to this.

Location is great, right in Exchange Street surrounded by local shops and close to the port. The atmosphere was kind of neat, parts of it were neat. They provide board games that can be played at the table while you wait for your food or enjoy your meal. That was fun, we played trivial pursuit and quickly remembered how bad we were at it. Lol. While there I got this ""chain restaurant"" feeling. I don't think it is a chain but it felt that way. It felt kitschy and like I could buy a franchise and order from a catalog so that my branding is the same. 
Their menu is mostly sausage, hot dogs, & sides with a few other options. I had the Chicago dog, long way from Chicago but it sounded good. It was good, the portions were small so I didn't feel like I got my money's worth and it really wasn't cheap. I don't drink but my husband, a beer geek, said the beer was ok. He got a flight to test out some of the offerings and I seem to remember that he didn't drink all of them. A couple were not pleasing to his beer palate.

1) read the menu
2) walk to the counter and order what you will 
3) sit and wait to be called. 

Sounds pretty simple but you will understand why I wrote it that way if you visit. Only way I figured it out or anyone else that was there was by being told. 

The food is EXTREMELY overpriced for ""gourmet"" hotdogs. Pretty standard Fenway frank with a few slices of tomato does not warrant a $9 price tag.

cheaply priced, but great selection of beer and other drinks - these rotate
a rustic/dive bar type atmosphere
random live music that's mostly pretty awesome  - GO TIM BERGERON!!!!
dive bar food - i.e. sausages, low maintenance apps, etc
friendly knowledgeable counter service, prompt delivery of food

super classy or refined - this isn't a traditional dive bar because it's fairly clean and everyone is cool, however it's definitely a bit hipster/casual.  
full meals - you CAN get full on the food and they aren't stingy but this is more of a happy hour/beer and snack type place

I am not sure how to describe it, it didn't really taste like anything, I would not get it again. The buffalo chicken dip was embarrassing.

I absolutely love The Thirsty Pig in nice weather and have positive, but less excited feelings about it during the winter or on a rainy day. The tap list is great, always lots of local options to try and they switch it up regularly. If you're not drinking beer they do have some ginger brew bottles available as well, and probably some other soda options. The sausages are good, though I'm not always 100% in the mood for a sausage, and you really need to be cool with eating that to enjoy the food. You order food inside and they will come deliver it to your table when it is ready.

Here's the best part: the back patio. Why don't more places have a nice patio like this?! We get such a short nice season, I want to be outside for as much of it as possible. In worse weather, the indoor space is best for groups of 2-4 people, much bigger and you will struggle with where to be.

This place has a great offering of a variety of different sausages, including a vegan sausage.  I had a Blueberry Chicken Sausage which was unlike anything I have had in the past.  The Thirsty Pig also boasts a good selection of different local and regional brews.  Two beers ($6) and two sausage sandwiches with sides ($10) came to $32 before tip and tax.

The venue is somewhat smaller, but intimate. It instantly made me think of how it would be the perfect place to go out on a date. They have a small bar with some seating, and when there is nice weather, they have a fenced in outdoor patio space with cafe dangling lights. The restaurant has accents of modern lighting fixtures and has contrasts of black and white between the checkered floor, the black tables and chairs, and the white walls. 

I will say, my first experience with their lunch didn't leave me wanting more. I had ordered a quinoa dish, and while it was okay, the portion was incredibly small and the taste was just ""meh."" I had never planned on really coming back, but I'm super happy that a few months later a friend of mine wanted to come here for dinner. My dinner experience ended up being terrific and I have come numerous times since then for dinner. 

isa's menu has a variety of options, and it changes pretty consistently since they have a farm-sourced menu that changes with the seasons. Their menu is separated by a variety of starters, main dishes, salads, and sides. I have had the chili-rubbed pork chop, the bolognese pasta, a haddock dish, the cheese plate, brussel sprouts, an eggplant quesadilla, bistro steak, and a pasta dish with rabbit. Honestly, all of the dishes that I have had for dinner are incredibly flavorful and are decently portioned. I would recommend any of the dishes that I have ordered here, however the standout for me is the pork chop! If they have it on their menu, GET IT. 

Service is always top notch as well. There is a fine line of being neglected and/or being checked on too much, and the serving staff at isa has really mastered this art.

Isa, however... it's been weeks and I'm still savoring the octopus, duck sandwich with a sweet berry chutney, and rabbit hash. All SO incredibly well done. 

8 out of 10 times, chefs seem to overcook octopus, and you're left eating an expensive rubber tire with tentacles, but the octopus here was cooked and slightly charred to perfection. 

The rabbit hash and duck sandwich -- I'm pretty sure I drool about them even in my sleep. Neither were overly complex nor simple, but just the right balance of flavors to make them outstanding.

I had been to Isa before for dinner (they hadn't been open very long at that point). The food didn't wow me - it was, in my opinion, overly priced for underwhelming portions of just alright food. The outdoor ""patio"" (for lack of a better term) area, however, did wow me - it felt like I had been transported out of Portland and was nestled away at some known-by-locals-only, hip spot in Brooklyn. The long, narrow alley-way feel with exposed brick on one side, the pots of homegrown cherry tomatoes, the Edison light bulbs above... very, very cool.

I recently came back for brunch. While the inside didn't wow me, this time the food and service did. Arrived at 11am when they opened; stayed until well past 3pm and, long after the bills had been paid and we had outstayed our welcome (though we were *never* made to feel that way!) our water glasses and coffee mugs remained full. They were super considerate about (and even two-steps ahead of us regarding) dietary restrictions. There was no real wait for table. They served food and cocktails off both the lunch and brunch menu until 4pm.

This is EVERYTHING other brunch places in Portland should be doing and are not.

So yes... brunch perfection hidden in plain sight.

The egg sandwich (currently for $8 sans meat) is twice as big as everyone else's sandwich in town. All that scrambled egg, cheddar, and smear of the day (I've seen pesto as an option, I've seen onion jam as an option) on house made focaccia is almost too much, but it's not (no it reallh is, but I don't want Isa to change this bargain breakfast deal, so ignore I wrote that, mmmkay Isa?!). Get a side of hollandaise to dip your sandwich in, skip the home fries (they're a little greasy) and get the perfectly golden fries instead, and enjoy what has to be the best coffee-based alcohol drink in the city: the Boozy Hot Mexican Coffee (no spice here! this baddie is just coffee, tequila, kahlua, cardamom syrup, and cream). Also, get the Hibiscus Margarita while you're indulging. I don't even like tequila, guys. I. Don't. Even. Like. Tequila. But those two drinks are flavorful, balanced, and no less than uhmaaaaahzing.

All in all, having been to Isa during different seasons for different meals, if you can score brunch outside in their pretty little alley... You will love, love, love it. Went a long time ago for dinner and haven't been back? This is one of those places you probably need to try again... for brunch.

The restaurant itself is small and cozy, with black lacquered ceiling and old-school lights hanging from the ceiling giving it a retro yet homey vibe. It felt a bit similar to NYC in that there really was not much privacy / space between tables, but that didn't make a huge difference to us. Service was quick, with food coming quickly and water being brought by quickly for refills. The beer menu is mostly local stuff from nearby, although I did encounter a beer (Florens IPA from Austin Street Brewery) that I had not been able to find anywhere else. There are cocktails and a good assortment of other nonalcoholic beverages at brunch as well, but I stuck with my tall can of beer and plenty of water.

The food here was really good, which was a relief after our poor dinner outing the night before at a newer restaurant as well. We started with the cod fritters and the lobster tostada, and while we love the lobster up here and the tostada was pretty good (clean flavors with generous amounts of radish as a garnish, although the corn didn't do much), the fritters was absolutely fantastic. The fry on the fritters was just right - not too heavy - and the chunks of cod were succulent and flaky, and the whole fritter paired excellently with the light tartare sauce spread beneath them. The mains were similarly good, with my only negative comment being that the duck carnitas tacos were already out somehow(?), so I went with the substituted pork version instead - quite solid, but with only 2 tacos and an overdressed side salad clocking in at $14, it felt like a worse value than I would get in NYC. My wife's osso buco stew was very flavorful, though, with the beef cubes being highly tenderized and the tomato broth being infused with lots of herbs and a hint of spice.

Ate here on a Friday evening and enjoyed ourselves! I was nervous about going somewhere that doesn't take reservations on a Friday night, but we were seated right away. 
As a table we ordered the olives, French fries, heirloom tomato salad, grilled octopus, the lamb, the rabbit, the pork chop, and the steak. 
The olives were fine, they were olives. 
The French fries were kinda sad. Some were good and crisp and some were no good and soggy and oily. I don't recommend those. 
The heirloom tomato salad was stupid good - I wish we ordered two. 
The grilled octopus was absolutely delicious, but less of a portion than we expected. 
The lamb and rabbit dishes were both great and the individuals at our table who ordered them raved and raved about them. I tried bites and thought they were yummy! 
My husband got the pork chop and felt it was a little dry and needed more of the pineapple flavor. 
I got the chimichurri steak with greens - the flavor was great. I ordered it med-rare and it came in ever so slightly under, but not enough to send back. Our waitress offered to have it refired for me and I declined because it was so close that I was very happy with most of it. And it meant my husband got extra bites - so he was happy too.   
We got the tres leches cake for dessert and it was delicious and the perfect end to the meal.",4.5,2,"['79 Portland St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65808,-70.26494,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Salad, "
867,EVGkegIGDO91k2q7WHadxQ,isa,867,2017-12-03,"Isa is a super cute little restaurant with some really delicious food. We went here a couple weeks ago to try out a new place for dinner.

We arrived at about 8PM for dinner and were the only group waiting for a table, which was good as there is not much waiting room inside. The hostess was very kind and offered us some drinks while we waited. She personally took our orders and brought us our drinks.

The interior was very elegant. It is on the smaller side, however this creates a very cozy intimate feel. It is in a beautiful brick building which provides a nice touch of rustic charm. The décor is also very calming and tasteful which just makes you feel relaxed and able to enjoy your experience.

We were quickly seated as soon as there was a table available for us. We were greeted by our server and offered some water.

The menu was great and offered some great options that you probably wouldn't see at every restaurant.

We started out with some of fries and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious. They had a wonderful glaze and were served with some bacon.... Yum!

For my meal, I decided on the braised local rabbit which is something that I had never tried before...... or even thought about trying for that matter! But, boy am I glad that I did. This was absolutely delicious. The rabbit was served with garganelli and English peas. The flavor was simply amazing.

Other meals at the table included the marinated bistro steak and the grilled pork chop. I was able to have bites of both of these and they were also delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent.

The service throughout our meal was excellent and very consistent. We were appropriately taken care of without feeling like we were being hounded.

This was a wonderful place, and I will definitely be returning.",4.5,2,"['79 Portland St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65808,-70.26494,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Salad, "

Located on a corner in a very nice brick building, this small dining room with bar looked welcoming and the porch outside was perfect. All the ingredients were local and superb, the cooking was creative and really well executed. They even had a homemade rhubarb/something non alcoholic soda for my wife and preggers daughter. We did not get to try dessert as dusk hit and the girls were getting buzzed by mosquitoes (not the fault of Isa!). The owners will get consistent five star reviews once they can maintain a waitstaff this place deserves.

The first time was so memorable that we kept wanting to go back and make sure it wasn't a fluke. I don't often have octopus, but the last time we were there, we got that dish and it was the best octopus I had ever eaten.

This time we started with the happy hour taquitos for $5. They had potato and cheese and a delicious romesco on top. You can tell they were homemade and at 3 to an order, it was quite a deal. Nice and crispy with manchego cheese lightly dusted on top.

Next, we had salt cod fritter was dill pickle tartar dipping sauce. I have had many cod fritters in the past, so my mind was expecting one thing and my pallet got an entirely different experience. These salt cod fritters were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The texture was like a really soft crab cake, which made me believe they were freshly made. The sauce was a excellent compliment along with the spritz of lemon completed the dish.

We really enjoy getting one thing at a time. One, because it prolongs the dining experience allowing us to take in the atmosphere and service. Also, we like to get a taste of the food before really committing to a full meal. Many times, people order way too much and just guzzle it down without enjoying.

The last thing we got was the eggplant lasagna - housemade pasta, ricotta, and tarragon. This dish was also excellent! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the eggplant was sliced to mimic the pasta sheets. On top was a delicious helping of ricotta they make in-house. You can tell time, love, and care went into this dish. And it was drizzled with an excellent olive oil.

Isa is a beautiful restaurant that is neat and clean and makes you feel very comfortable. The food and service are both outstanding, making for a pleasurable dining experience.

I do agree with a review saying the service was ""missing something"". The waiter seemed and sounded cold. However, it didn't affect the star rating in this case. We ordered salt cod fritters, octopus salad, lobster tacos, tuna sandwich and pork sandwich. 

Salt cod fritters was crispy outside and soft inside and the aioli brought the fritters to another level. Octopus salad ""wow"" me. I made salad and salad dressing almost everyday.

I came at an odd hour between lunch and dinner, so I can't really say how busy the place gets.  But for me at least, it was a laid-back meal.

To start with I ordered the panzanella which was quite refreshing.  The cucumbers were juicy and the bread soaked in the basil vinaigrette really enhanced the flavor.  Very delicious.  For the entree I tried the eggplant lasagna.  Lasagna is usually such a coin toss at restaurants, because they can often end up being too heavy a dish.  Instead it was light and airy, the ricotta not being too overpowering like in certain places.  The cuts of eggplant within its folds was a nice touch.  

It was a light meal that hit all the marks.  isa promotes their choice of using locally-sourced fresh ingredients and it shows.

Portland tends to be on the pricey side when it comes to dining, yet Isa is an exceptional value.  Dinner here seems to be about a quarter of the price of other places in the city, and the quality is just as high.  Perhaps it is because the neighborhood isn't as charming as the Old Port.

The menu is somewhat small, but extremely varied, and everyone should be able to find something that suits them.

Have you ordered yet? Great. Here's the rest of my review...

Isa is the total package. They offer terrific service, fresh, seasonal food, and some of the most interesting and surprising (all in a good way) flavors that I've ever had. Do you like rhubarb? How about mustard seed? Ok, now picture a pleasant combo of both of those on fire-grilled asparagus with some shaved pecorino. Having trouble picturing it? Well, good thing you're already there...just order some and see for yourself!

The drinks were pricey ($12 for my Rosemary Gimlet) but were absolutely fantastic and trust me...you only need one! It was refreshing, and came loaded with local Bimini Gin.  A real treat. My husband had the Isa Sidecar and it was soft and fruity. 

We tried the arugula salad with rhubarb mustardo and burrata - wow. Light, flavorful, and lots of burrata. The spring gnocchi were soft, pillowy perfection, in a heavenly sauce. The meal was so delicious that we felt like we'd be doing ourselves a serious disservice to skip dessert, so we went for the server's recommendation and split a piece of the tres leches​ with candied orange peel. It was a showstopper. The server mentioned that it's their signature dessert and that it's never come off the menu...I pray that it never comes off. It was moist, light, not overly sweet, and the best way to end such a fabulous meal.

The atmosphere is upscale yet cozy...Isa has a classy vibe, but is not a place where you feel underdressed or uncomfortable. The staff is warm and really knows their stuff! We didn't have to ask for a thing while we were there, and felt completely cared for the whole time. Excellent customer service can be tough to find, but these folks have it down to a science.

Service was phenomenal. Very attentive and a pleasant attitude/smile with every check in.

Seriously some of the best food I have ever eaten. Not just for Portland, but my entire 33 years walking this Earth! 

Lamb meatballs were the most tender meatballs I've ever had. We were unsure what to expect of the green sauce versus a red, but it was ooooooh so creamy and delicious!

The cod fritters were equally amazing, served with a thick smear of tartar sauce. Fried to perfection!

My husband got the rabbit pasta with peas. We are sad to eat a bunny, but at least it was f-ing yummy. Just how I picture bugs bunny tasting after sitting in a cauldron full of carrots.

I ordered bolognese, and was blown away! I'm a huge bolognese fan, and never expected this to be the best I've ever eaten!

We ordered desserts, even though being quite full. We didn't dare pass up another amazing course even if we had to unbutton our pants to make room.

This is a MUST if you are visiting Portland. Don't be dismayed by the slightly disheveled neighborhood. It was still safer than a lot of streets in Boston/Cambridge MA in my opinion.

I followed it with the eggplant lasagna which was pretty exceptional - fresh pasta, fresh ricotta, perfectly cooked eggplant and a drizzle of EVVO.

903,EVGkegIGDO91k2q7WHadxQ,isa,903,2017-10-04,"There are some things I really like about Isa: the ambiance is nice; it's more casual and less expensive than the nearby Back Bay Grill, and yet it's a nice spot for a date. It's warm and cozy, it's fancier fare than pub food, they bring out the (delicious) pre-meal bread. Beer and wine selections are limited but ""refined"", reservations aren't often required. I used to have this at the top of my list for date-night spots for friends visiting Portland.

I probably only visit myself maybe once every couple months, and the menu never seemed to change much. This is fine, but if there's only a couple things on the menu that you're really interested in eating, you want them to be near excellent every time. And one would think that the kitchen, only preparing these certain dishes repeatedly, would also have them down to a science. 

A visit a few months back led me to the bistro steak, as I'm not a big seafood person (a sacrilege in Maine, I know) and wasn't feeling rabbit or pasta. It wasn't very memorable but my girlfriend enjoyed whatever it was that she had. On a more recent visit, I went specifically for the steak (and the atmosphere) and m'lady had the pan-seared Bluefish. I ordered the steak medium-rare, and the nice guy serving us said that temp back to me, and yet when it arrived it was much closer to ""well"" with just a hint of pink in there and somewhat tough which is always a bummer to someone wanting a bloody steak. If nothing else, I just wanted a steak to taste better than I cook at home, which isn't a very high bar. Sadly, my girlfriend commented on how dry and overcooked her bluefish was before I even commented on mine, the only moisture coming from the accoutrement. 

I have no doubt they would have fixed both of these issues without much annoyance, but when you've had a long day and just want to relax and have a nice date, you don't really want to sit through the awkwardness and time of sending things back, which is where we were at. The lamb meatballs we had to start were divine, so I suppose it's just a matter of ordering the right thing on any given night.

We'll probably still stop by for a drink and a snack on occasion, but I don't think I'll be dropping $25-ish on any other entrees in the near future.",4.5,2,"['79 Portland St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65808,-70.26494,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Salad, "

The corn tortillas with corn masa and a red pepper sauce bed was a sleeper hit; sublime light red sauce with crispy filled tortillas.  Terrific texture and just the right portion size.  

Next for main (lunch) courses: Eggplant lasagna, which was well made and super tasty, if a touch oily, with a perfect egg-shaped ball of ricotta on top.

A round of drinks and our order placed - the two aforementioned dishes plus one of the specials. To my surprise, all three were served with the same pasta - the menu hadn't specified. I'm normally big on sharing, but we all got a bit territorial with our meals (because they were so delicious) and we didn't even exchange bite for bite. As tempting as the others looked, I was perfectly content cleaning my plate and only mine. The others followed suit. You might think that polishing off an entire bowl of pasta would leave you feeling overstuffed and weighed down. On the contrary! The portions were just right and the pasta not too heavy that we were full without feeling uncomfortable. Exactly how I want to end a meal :)

I had never had rabbit before and wasn't sure what to expect, but the dish ended up being fantastic!

My first visit to Isa was ok.  The food was good, but I thought the amount of food for the amount of money charged seemed off balance.  SO I stayed away for a long, long time.
This past Sunday, I was looking for a place in town that was still serving brunch after 3.  Most brunch places in town stop serving at 3, which I find kind of ridiculous.  I think Portland should move to a NYC brunch schedule and serve until 6.  Ok, how about a compromise and serve until 4????
The great news is Isa DOES serve brunch until 4, so there we were at 3 walking in, with plenty of available tables.
My husband and I both ordered brunch cocktails.  Mine involved hibiscus tea and I enjoyed it very much, although I did think it was a small amount for a $10 cocktail.  My husband got something with bourbon, which looked more generous.
For food we got:
Starters for the table:
Codfish fritters-Very tasty and fresh with a house made tartar sauce, small serving
Fries with aioli-I tend to like my fries browner (personal preference)-solid overall
Eggs Benedict-Nice job with this classic.  Served on a biscuit and came with home fries and a green salad 
Roasted lamb hash-Nice mix of lamb and root vegetables, two sunny side eggs on top.  Kind of a small serving.
Croque Monsieur-Loved it, high praise
A braised pork and pineapple sandwich-Good reviews

We were not going to get dessert, BUT decided to have a look at the menu and picked a coconut cream pie and a brownie with nutella ice cream to share.  They also serve tandem coffee (highly recommended).  The desserts were actually spectacular, especially the coconut cream pie.  I liked that so much, I might place it in my ""worth a special trip"" category.

Overall, I would suggest Isa, if you are in town and looking for brunch.  The only reason for four stars, instead of 5 is that this town has a STRONG brunch game and the competition is abundant and stellar.  
On the other hand, if you have a very hungry crowd (meaning more generous portions) and want a nicer sit down brunch, I might suggest Outliers, Abilene or the Frog and Turtle in Westbrook.

For a more in depth review:  

My friends and I started outlet own brunch club and this was the inaugural spot.  The servers were super friendly and sat us right away even though two members of our party had not yet arrived.  The server we had was super friendly but also knowledgeable.  She specifically asked if anyone had allergies or sensitivities, which I really liked.  


The atmosphere was great.  Isa is definitely smaller, however they clearly do attempt to accommodate everyone as there was a larger party of ten in the restaurant.  The space is a bit noisy, due to the acoustics, but it is well decorated and definitely clean.  I can see it getting quite crowded but the space seems pretty modular.  There is an outdoor patio (it was too cold for it sadly) and they have a small but well kept row of parking spaces (maybe seven or eight cars worth) in the back. 

My food was delicious.  I had the croque madam and the French onion soup.  It was well prepared. My only issue with this restaurant, and the reason it gets four stars instead of five is that it took a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen.  Think 25 minutes for the soup and over 45 minutes for the entrees.  While I definitely get that everything is from scratch, if we were super hungry or in a rush this would be a problem.  I would personally rather have the food take longer and be delicious, but this is an important planning factor and it was long enough that I couldn't NOT mention it.

On this our first visit, we stopped in for their very first day serving brunch. We are really glad we did as the food was very,very good. 

I started by trying the lamb sliders, which consisted of spicy lamb sausage, pickled  red peppers and goat cheese served on focaccia. Mmmm,Mmmm Yum and large living in the land of small plates I will add enough to share with several people (I of course, devoured the whole thing)! I particularly enjoyed  the light and fluffy goat cheese, It had the most wonderful consistence like it had been whipped. In any case the cheese and sausage made a super yummy flavor bomb when combined with the lamb sausage.
Next up was the croque Madame, layers of crisp Standard Bakery bread, covered with prosciutto and melted Swiss, then topped with a beautiful fried farm egg. So good, so very very good! 

My wife had the baked eggs and they were very good too. Super rich and creamy balanced nicely  by the tangy tomatoes and kale.

939,tEQCE_cnOAhQZ791XCkVtQ,scales,939,2019-04-22,"Just had dinner here for Easter Sunday. The atmosphere is wonderful, somehow both relaxed and higher end at the same time. There were people there in jeans and flanels as well as people like ourselves, nicely dressed (although it was a holiday, might not be the norm)  They have their daily catch on display at the front which is cool, it was even decorated for the occasion with an ice/snow-bunny and colored eggs. 

The wait staff is all very friendly, they clear in a timely manner and remove empty glasses/refill water basically without you noticing which is ideal. They're also very knowledgeable. My BF and I asked about the pronunciation of a certain fish since we've heard multiple ways over the years, and received a fascinating lesson about the fish, it's various names and how it varies by regions they can be found in. 

This place is right on the docks, so you can look out the windows and get a very classical Maine-type view from your table.  Sadly it was a bit foggy, so there wasn't as much to see as there normally would have been, but it was pretty  while it lasted. 

The wine list was great. I personally don't drink domestic wines; I find I can taste the higher sulfur content in wines from CA, so I prefer to drink imports. There were options from Spain, France, Denmark, New Zealand, along with several others.  Most options are by the bottle, but there are decent options sold by the glass.  They also have a great selection of local beers, ciders, and specialty cocktails made by the bar. 

We started with one of their artisinal bread options, Anadama, which was topped with salted butter and molasses.  OMG, so, sooooo good. The bread was fresh, and the balance of salty and sweet was perfect.

For dinner my BF ordered the halibut, which has hazelnuts, brown butter, lemon and potatoes with it. I took a bite and that was to die for. Perfectly cooked, nicely presented, and a great balance of favors.  I got the dorade (the fish we asked about, lol), which comes with lemon, almond butter, and seasoned with paprika and coriander. This was flayed table-side for me, by a new waiter who was training, all of maybe 15. Sweet kid, and he did an excellent job under the tutelage of the senior server who was helping him. Generally speaking, i didn't have too many bones to pick myself. The fish was cooked perfectly, not dry at all and again the pairing of flavors could not have been better. 

The dessert menu has some daily specials on it, but I got a chocolate frappe (childhood favorite on mine) and my BF got a wild blueberry frozen custard.  

In the end we were pleased all around. Great atmosphere, staff, food, and drinks.  This is one of those special occasions we go out somewhere nice and don't worry about the cost, maybe do that a couple times a year, and this came out to be far more reasonable than I thought it would.

If you really like the flavor and sweetness of pineapples, you will love the fluke ceviche. For me, I felt that the dish lacked acidity, and was more like fish in a very sweet sauce.

The duck agnolotti pasta with foie gras and morel mushrooms was on a totally different level, it was a dish bursting with umami and richness in comparison. The pasta was cooked al dente, and had a generous amount of filling. This was an appetizer sized pasta and it was the perfect portion size since it was so rich. I usually hate peas, but I loved the addition of peas on top as it was a nice burst of freshness in contrast to the creamy sauce. Order this if they have it available!

We came to Scales on a Tuesday night and were immediately sat. 
The ambiance was great, a nice restaurant but not overly fancy feeling and well lit. The kitchen is also an open concept and all of the oysters and fish is on ice at the front. 

We sat and each ordered glass of wine. The wine list was huge and really well priced. 
We started with 1/2 dozen oysters (2 of each that they have- they have 3 rotating choices- so we each got to have one of each). 
The oysters were very good and all local. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the seared scallops, which came with squash, pancetta, and kale in a delicious cream sauce. She orders scallops any time it's on a menu and said this was potentially  the best she's had. 
I ordered the seared tuna (part of the raw bar menu and an appetizer/small plate) and the Brussels sprouts side as a DIY entree. 
The tuna was perfectly seared and tasted so fresh. The Brussels sprouts were also great, shaved and cooked perfectly (browned) with big, delicious pieces of duck. 

Since everything was so great, we felt we had to have dessert. We ordered the chocolate crémeux, which was rich but accompanied with many things that balanced it out. We also had a dessert wine to go with it (Colosi Passito Mascato), which was fantastic.

This is the restaurant you take someone to impress, especially out of towners. It's a gorgeous, wide open new building directly on the ocean. There's really no discussion...this is the most stunning restaurant in the city of Portland and should be your first choice as a seafood destination. It's a class above a place like Eventide and a much better atmosphere than sister restaurants Street and Co. and Fore Street. 

With the above being said, as a local, I wouldn't come for entrees again unless someone else is paying. At $32-$38 for most items, which includes only a minimal side, it's just too expensive for anything besides a special occasion. The arctic char, haddock and hake were all excellent, and about as good and fresh as you'll find in the city. If you're visiting Portland, stop reading and make a reservation (and you'll definitely need one).

For me, the happy hour and/or bar is a great up""scale"" (couldn't resist) year round choice. It's a gorgeous stone bar and oysters are shucked directly in front of you on a pile of ice placed in a crevice. From 4 pm-6 pm in winter, it's $1 oysters with various wine and beer options at $6. The appetizers, priced $9-$16, are much more reasonable and great for sharing. In order of preference:
-Mussels: a massive portion in an oversized cast iron skillet with perhaps the best bread I've ever tasted, baked across the street at Standard.
-Seared Tuna: melts in your mouth. I can't think of a better version, anywhere.
-Fried Cauliflower: decent, but not exceptional. Similar items at Central Provisions are better.
-Salt Cod Croquettes: too salty for my taste.
-On different visits, the fried clams and fried squid have been excellent.

The staff was super friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to eat off their menu. The server suggested a special appetizer that they had that night which was a fried branzino on top of sweet/spicy slaw. I went with his suggestion and ordered that and then also ordered 3 raw oysters and 3 raw clams since I had never tried either raw before. My main dish I ordered was the Seared Scallop entree. 

The fried branzino was phenomenal. Like easily one of the best appetizers I had during my business trip. The branzino wasn't super heavy feeling and the slaw was really tasty. The raw oysters and clams were presented on a very appealing platter. I just however decided raw oysters and clams aren't for me and that is nothing against Scales. The Seared Scallop entree was one of my favorite entrees I had during my trip. The scallops were seared to perfection and the combination of mushrooms, bacon, spinach, and parsnip cream sauce was delicious.

This place fit the bill and boy did it not disappoint!

We did not have reservations on a Saturday evening but were able to get seated within 5 minutes - though this may have been due to the rainy weather and maybe not being as busy, it was very nice that we didn't have to wait a while. 

As soon as you walk in you're greeted by a huge
Box of frozen seafood on display and a nice open seating space (big windows with views of the water) - It reassures you that you're in for a fresh dining experience.

The restaurant itself is lovely with lots of windows and sunlight.  Free valet parking makes it very convenient.

My family was up in Portland for vacation so we were a party of 12.  I looked at the menu ahead of time online and was excited about the short rib and duck entrees.  While it's a seafood restaurant, I wasn't in a seafood mood.  When we were seated, I was disappointed to not see the entrees that I saw online, but know menus are subject to change so I didn't think anymore of it.  I was avoiding shellfish and am lactose intolerant so my choices were limited, especially with no changes to the entrees.  I settled on the sockeye salmon which was over cooked and salty.  Most of my family enjoyed their dishes however.  

As we were wrapping up, we noticed someone at the next table got the whole fried fish.  It wasn't on our menu so that's when we asked our waitress how that table got the dish.  She then explained the rule of a limited menu for parties of 12 or more... and that it should have been explained when the reservation was made.  I didn't make the reservation so not sure if it was properly explained.  Since they were a party of 8, they got the regular menu.  

Whether the limited menu was explained or not, I think it's bullshit that a party that is spending more money doesn't get to order what they want.  From what I recall, the limited menu does not include the whole fried fish, seafood stew, duck, short rib, or any of the sandwiches.  We had 3 kids with us and my sister had even asked if there was a kids menu / smaller portions and our waitress said no, knowing that the ""regular menu"" offered sandwiches that would be better portioned for kids.  So instead of being able to get the fish sandwich with fries my young nephew had to go with the full order of fish and chips.  And instead of getting the short ribs, I was getting something I didn't want.

When you drop $800 at a restaurant, you expect more and you expect to be treated equally and not considered as an inconvenience to the kitchen.  

Thank you for making us feel so special as customers who create such inefficiencies for you  to the point that you print special limited menus for us!",4.0,3,"['68 Commercial St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65735,-70.25003000000001,"American (New), Seafood, "

Scales is one of those restaurants that is great for corporate dinners, taking your family when they visit from out-of-state, or celebrating a special occasion in a large group.  The space is large and open, and the tables are moveable, which lends itself well to group dining. Scales is fancy enough to impress, but still relaxed enough for everyone to feel comfortable.  

Scales is one of the better places to get seafood in town, and perhaps the best place that's right on the water.

There were many things that we had at the table (we were a table of 8) like seared ahi tuna that was encrusted in peppercorns and the fish and chips that was light and fluffy with the batter not being too greasy and fatty.

Dinner: we split the roasted lobster for dinner with a side of Broccoline/Guanciale and WOWWWWWW. Ritz cracker goodness and the MOST amazing flavor. It was my first ever lobster and the best ever. I felt spoiled and left covered in butter. Decorum went out the window. It was fine. The greens were good too but LOBSTER.

We started with two of the appetizer specials.  One was a fluke dish and the other was a fish sashimi.  These were a great starting point and were perfectly prepared and flavored.  We then moved to the oysters- with a selection of all three available that day.  Again - beautiful!  Our main course was the lobster roll for both of us.  After the week long vacation up the coast - these still remain our favorite - they were really flavorful and perfect.

The chowder was good too but I definitely prefer the lobster stew. We also ordered the Maine scallops (served with pork belly, pearl onions, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. Seasoned a little heavily but nothing unbearable. The scallops, however, seemed a bit overdone... not ""melt in your mouth"" as other reviews have stated but still, really good and worth it. However, we ordered the Brussels sprouts with duck confit and it was SO SALTY. It was so salty that we ordered dessert (chocolate frozen custard with almonds and toasted coconut) to offset the saltiness before attempting to finish our meal.

    My daughter had a hamburger and fries.  The fries were homemade and really good.    My husband and I both had the lobster stew. I was expecting more in it than a few pieces of lobster.  When I hear stew, I expect meat and veggies.  It was good, but I don't think it is something that I would order again.  
   For entrees, I had the scallop dish.  It was out of this world.    I love scallops and have them when I can.   This was the first time I got more than 3 on my plate at a restaurant.  I got the lobster stew because usually when I order scallops somewhere I leave the table hungry because there are so few.  Not this time.  They were perfectly cooked and more than enough.   I wish I could remember what the sauce under them was, but I can't.     The whole dish was spectacular.    I would highly recommend it.

The location is beautiful inside - right on the docks where you can see fishermen unloading the daily catch. The fresh fish and lobsters and oysters on display is beautiful and gets you excited to try. The interior of the restaurant is sleek and modern and has high Windows perfect for watching the sunset right on the ocean. The cornbread was lovely and warm and very cute. I do wish they'd brought us three though since we were a party of three and they only brought 2. The smoked salmon appetizer was average. The salmon was fresh enough but the star of the dish was the farm tomatoes. The scallops were delicious - I enjoyed the corn that added lightness but found the overall dish too heavy with the dairy or butter sauce. The halibut was average. Definitely not a problem with the portion but the fish felt over cooked and drowned in butter and sauce. The lack of green on the plate also felt heavy and without a new texture or break from the fish. The steak was fine and the potatoes were well cooked but I wouldn't order it again.

The place was busy (late on a Tuesday) but we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt in taking our drink order. We looked through the menu and decided to sample some items from the raw bar as well as the regular menu. First course included oysters (all Maine and all 3 types were exceptional) tuna tartare, octopus with chorizo and clam chowder. The chowder was simply divine and the tartare was so fresh and so well balanced it might be the best I've ever tasted.  The hands down favorite, though, was the octopus. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and ever so subtly balanced in flavors with the chorizo, hazelnuts and a balsamic reduction. So. Amazing. Everything came out quickly and was served promptly. 

Entrees were a bit less adventurous, though equally delicious. We ordered both steamed and roasted lobsters as well as the baked haddock. The lobsters were amazing (no surprise) and the baked lobster is absolutely something that should be on any foodie's bucket list. Rich, savory texture and flavor topped with crunchy breadcrumbs - so good. But the star entree was the haddock. Served in a cast iron gratin with morels, fingerling potatoes and leeks swimming in a rich delicious cream sauce - this dish was pure heaven. I'd go back just for this. Seriously. It was the most ingenious presentation of haddock I've ever seen. 

We decided to sample dessert as well - blueberry crumble and a butterscotch sundae. Both were incredibly good. The crumble was warm and comforting and topped with delicious vanilla ice cream. The sundae was equally good and came topped with caramel popcorn. Such an amazing idea.

We arrived and our table wasn't ready. The maître d was super and arranged another table for us. Great! That, for me, was the last thing that went right.

Two dozen oysters arrived shortly after we sat down. We hadn't ordered them. It took 10 minutes to notify the server, during which they sat on our table, and after that we're delivered to the poor folks who actually ordered them. 

My calamari appetizer was very good. 
I ordered an octopus appetizer for dinner because I love octopus. It arrived looking wonderful - two large, nicely cooked tentacles. I took a bite - it was cold. I waited 5-10 minutes to get the servers attention and asked ""should it be cold?"" And it shouldn't so he took it back to the kitchen. No follow up; no suggestion it would be our soon. Nothing. 

Scallops arrived. They were put down in front of my sister and father, but they hadn't ordered them. They sat on the table a couple of minutes, and were then carried to another table- maybe the right table?

Oysters were fresh and delicious, but nothing special. 

Clam appetizer was FULL of sand. When we ate the first round of clams, the shells were mostly crushed and many were small and dry. We flagged out waiter over after tasting 3 or 4 clams to ask if the dish was supposed to be this crunchy. The waiter was kind enough to replace our dish with another. This time the clams were fatter and juicier...clearly, we got the bottom of the barrel last time. There was also less sand. 

The Scallop entree was good. Scallops were ever so slightly overcooked as the inside flesh started to get a little chewy. Flavor was good and sauce was thick and creamy.

I would never have a reason to come to Scales. The menu is almost entirely meat/seafood products. And well it should be with a name like ""Scales"" and a location *literally* on the water. But I was tipped off that they were serving some of the best dessert in Portland, so... 

The first time we came was late on a Thursday and we asked the host if we could just grab dessert and cocktails, he told us the bar was open for that. ""Could we maybe sit by the windows instead? We're having a date night!"" He didn't seem to like that request much. Dismissively he said, ""the answer is always no if you're not going to eat dinner"" (side note: seriously?!), ""but I'll let you this one time because we're not slammed.""

Not the best first impression, I'll tell you that much.

We were seated by the windows and, despite it being dark out, still got to watch a lobsterman set-up his boat for the next morning. Their location is offering hands-down one of the best views in the whole city. Being out on - and almost at level with - the pier like that is something incredibly special. Try to come here for dusk sometime; it's a breathtaking experience.

We heard the cheesecake was out of this world, and it changes seasonally. We were told that for the holidays/winter it's Spiced Autumn Cheesecake (with cider caramel, harvest granola, and a maple flavored whip cream) for $9.00. A bit steep, but well worth it - it tasted exactly like one would hope it would given the listed flavor profiles. I think this was in the top three cheesecakes I've ever had; well worth the price tag. And, come to find out they make all their desserts in house. Then again, why wouldn't they? The folks who own this place are also the same people behind Standard Baking Company. This alone makes me want to come back to order the cornbread with salted honey butter... I wonder if I would be forced to sit at the bar if I only ordered sides though?

The drinks were also amazing: my partner got the ""West End"" (whiskey, fernet, bitters, and orange) and claims it's one of the best, most balanced drinks he's had in a long time. I got the ""Autumn Sangria Infusion"" (red wine, herbs, spices) and it was good - it wasn't cloyingly sweet or as heavy as I was expecting and as such made for a solid nightcap choice.",4.0,3,"['68 Commercial St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65735,-70.25003000000001,"American (New), Seafood, "

1026,tEQCE_cnOAhQZ791XCkVtQ,scales,1026,2016-11-16,"Slick as a salmon, the harbor side seafood emporium deserves it's rep as one of the best in Portland, Maine. It's a long rectangular room that gets full up as quick as the guests fill up on the freshest the sea has to erp up. If they gave you a shovel and a pail instead of utensils, I'd be happy. I'd even be happy going all cave man with no cutlery or plates. So there. 

The decor is ceiling to floor glass so it's like eating in a fish bowl, which is most appropriate given the menu and location next to where the daily catch is off loaded. The menu is not for guppy tummies, either. Sure, you can order dishes by the half but they are still ample for a fisherman's hunger. I suggest you bag the half biz and step/swim up to the task at hand. Wow factor food.    

The place is what Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco could've been instead of the third stop in the air conditioned motor coach (full of oddly dressed tourists) to buy an octopus coffee mug or a ball cap in the shape of a shrimp. 

Scales is a sophisticated yet casual, light, airy and open space. There are lots of tables with elbow room to work that lobster like they was payin' you to eat it. There's a Raw Bar and a Long Bar (at least 100 feet...could be imbibing is the local past time), to enjoy the full bar options. 

Feel free to discount the opinion of Yelpers who only gave 3 stars, dragging the overall average down as one complained at being asked to wait in the bar for 10 minutes. It ain't like a segregation at Gitmo, bisides this place is busy for a reason. Or the one who dissed the joint because he/she/it didn't like sea food. Yo, what was you thinkin? Re-read the name of the place, you enter through a boat door, and the place is drippin' with lures for decor. Go ahead, order the Short Rib Pot Roast but don't roast the place because you don't like fish. You probably wouldn't like Rome either because it has too many old buildings.

The Vibe: Low key. Locals, yocals, and out of towners (and some Yelping downers),

The Bar Program: Lot's of crafty brews, a few ciders for orchard insiders, and an extensive wine list with many by the glass choices. The signature cocktails tend to be on the sweet side So? Just like our server Mikela who was truly sweet, helpful, humorous and enthusiastic. 

The Bug Light was a flute of boozy fruit (which describes half the patrons at the Red Velvet Lounge in OC). Eight Bells Rum, Barrel Aged Maple Syrup, OJ and Brut (as opposed to O.J. the Brute). 

The Fort Sumter was Tanguerey Gin, Muddled Fig, and Fresh Lime served up. Now fully muddled and addled myself, let's eat. 

The Food: This is Sea-forward dining. Duh! Right in the harbor where the fishermen deliver the sea's bounty daily. This is a working restaurant featuring the freshest and best of God's little swimming creatures this side of the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. Nothing here that's been fried even knows it's been fried. No residue, no oil, no puddle of rendered fish fat on your plate, nothing heavy here so order a pile of whatever sings to you. All good. 

Whole Belly Clams. These puppies were flash fried and served with Smoked Jalapeno Aioli and Lemon. Most places don't bother with the bellies (unless you're at a bar in Vegas). Usually you get only strips (also something reminiscent of Vegas). Here, you get the entire clam corpse, fried by an expert. Each belly had a crisp coating form fitting crunch surrounding a briny juicy little treasure. (Yeah, you can find that in Vegas too, but it will cost.)

The Special off menu offering the night I dined there was Diver Scallops. They too were fried, but it just seemed so right, and besides isn't America's favorite flavor crispy? Generally, scallops are too delicate to fry but the line cook manning that station had earned his fins, gills and tail badge and was truly a Fry Master...and I ain't shuckin' you, neither. And it came with a small hill of fries, done just right...my guilty pleasure. 

The Lobster Roll is a local legend as well. Oh, what a sweet fresh lobster! Look close and make sure in ain't still wigglin' in your bun (figuratively speaking). It is nestled in a split top, house baked, butter grilled roll, filled to over flowing with the crustacean that would drive a Rabbi off the Kosher cart. Served simply with Chives and Mayo, oh, I say, oh how wonderful was that little roll in the Bay? 

Dessert: No complaining that your own clam belly is obscuring the view of your shoes. Have the Concord Grape and Apple Pie baked in it's own ramekin with a crust as flaky as the current Presidential Transition Team.

From the raw oysters at the bar to the ginger cake dessert this was a wonderful experience- here are some tips for you: don't arrive feeling the world owes you a thing; have a reservation or content yourself with remaining at the bar, sampling appetizers, and promising yourself you will return. Ask your server what's good- they know. Look around you and feel what it is they are doing, from the music to the families to the fresh catches on display- realize the seafood is largely brought in from next door, not even trucked from across town.

One a recent long weekend trip to Portland, we got in to town on the later side mid-week and  The Honey Paw was one of the few restaurants open that was in walking distance from our hotel. 

I cannot explain my regret in not having been to this place before!  Service, cocktails, food, decor - everything hits the perfect sweet spot of being hip without being inaccessible.  We started off with a couple cocktails, British Invasion and Oath Breaker, both of which had the perfect balance of sweetness, spice, bitter, and booziness. They were so good that I got a second British Invasion. Next, we split the Fry Bread with Uni Butter - HOLY HELL THIS WAS AMAZING. The bread had an exterior crunch but an interior that was soft and chewy - the chiles, yuzu peels, and herbs strewn atop made each bite unique. While the uni butter was fantastic - do not skimp on this wonderful condiment with its ocean-y and umami interplay of flavors.

We each got a wok fried noodle dish. My husband got the Pork & Crab Mee Goreng (mien noodles, Jonah crab, chili crab sambal, deep fried shallots)-. The noodles had a wonderful chew to them. The Crab was plentiful. And the sambal that topped it was TO DIE FOR. The entire dish had the most amazing combination of textures. It was straight up amazing and I will definitely be ordering a dish of it all for myself next time we're there.  I got the Wok Fried Ramen Noodle (razor clams, littleneck clams, pork XO, preserved lemon, pickled onions) - again, an absolutely delicious dish with great textures. The fried clams were delectable and the onions (there were a few different kinds with different treatments) were plentiful without being overpowering.

We finished the meal off by splitting the Soft Serve ice Cream - their soft serve flavor of the day (burnt honey) with caramelized honey, honeycomb, and chocolate shell. This little sweet treat satiated our sweet tooth without being too sugary.",4.0,2,"['78 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6595876703614,-70.2510230719194,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Noodles, "

It was my first meal upon arriving in Portland and was a nice introduction to the eclectic food scene here.  I was seated right before happy hour ended, so I ordered the $3 char shu pork bao.  What came was a surprise as I was expecting a handheld stuffed bao, but it was actually more of a sheng jian bao.  The filling was tasty, but only luke warm.  The pastry part was really good.  The best part was actually the pickles that came with it.

I also had the fry bread with uni butter.  This one was less successful for me.  The bread was a bit tough when I expected something more fluffy on the inside.  The uni butter was my main problem with the dish.  It did not have much uni flavor.  I did like whatever the seasoning on the bread was since it had a great umami-ness to it, but it would have been much better had the uni flavor stood out in the butter.

The beet salad (gado gado) was my favorite item of the night.  It was this complex salad with a large variety of textures, flavors, and temperatures.  It was really fun to eat as no two bites were the same.  The beets were fresh and sweet.  The fried potatoes and hard boiled egg added some substance.  The peanut sauce was super flavorful and packed a punch.  It's a really memorable dish.

For me entree, I had the smoked lamb khao soi.  It was okay, but ate really rich and lacked some depth.  The problem was in the broth itself.  The broth was somehow one-note even though it had all these ingredients that should have given it depth.  The lamb was well cooked and had good flavor.  There were lots of pickled vegetables in it to give some acidity and break up the broth.  But it didn't quite come together.  It was also served sort of luke warm and with all the pickled vegetables, quickly cooled down.  My thought was there was just too much stuff in it.  Give more broth and tone down the additions and it'll seem more hearty and warm.

Overall, a surprisingly good meal.  I like that they melded Maine ingredients with a pan Asian style.  I'm not sure it's a place I'd crave and want to return to, but it was a good experience.",4.0,2,"['78 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6595876703614,-70.2510230719194,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Noodles, "

I'll claim this one for research purposes since I was scoping it out for a company dinner. The food looked great from the reviews, but given I'm scoping for my work.. I have to think of those that would probably be less adventurous when it comes to eating -i mean asian fusion sounds intimidating to some of my boomer coworkers. 

I started out with the lobster cakes and a singha beer. This app is perfect to share among 2..or 1 if you're extra hungry. I was the latter and even if there was 2.. I would have tried to sneak the majority of it. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich for the entree. This had a kimchi-buffalo sauce with lettuce and cheese. The bread seemed to be made in house and the chicken had a nice crisp thin breading to it. It came with kimchi potato chips. Needless to say.. The plate was licked clean. The last bit is by far what you HAVE to order - the soft serve. Jesus this was good. Simple vanilla. Dark chocolate hard shell drizzle. Honeycomb cookie crunchy things. That bowl was licked cleaaan too. 

In case you couldn't tell... I'm a fan. My research scoping was well worth it and I'll definitely be booking them for my work outting. Though ""fusion"" places can intimidate some..

I have to say, this strip has THE BEST food in town. The lines for any of these restaurants can get crazy long, and there isn't much seating either. Expect to either be seated at the bar, window, or at the communal table. 

We tried the Honey Lobster Toast: lobster tucked tightly between two perfect buttered toasts, drizzled with a cream sauce over, Lobster Wontons: this was my fave! It tasted like a perfect wonton soup with a twist of lobster, the Halibut Crudo: chili, citrus, & dill were what helped make the dish (However, I still prefer Eventide's crudos), the Soup Dumplings: 2 small pieces, and the dumpling was too doughy (I prefer Empire's), Fried Wings: lime & chili, with coconut on top, this somehow tasted better the next day served with rice!, and lastly, the Nam Prik Ong: rigatoni, spicy pork, and chicharrones SO different, but in a good way.",4.0,2,"['78 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6595876703614,-70.2510230719194,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Noodles, "

When our first choice ended up being closed for nearby construction, I was a bit dismayed to stop in here as I'm a noodle lover but just wasn't in the mood that day.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover their lunch menu includes three unique sandwiches all served with some equally unique kimchi chips, so we all went with either the fried chicken (""napa kimchi, iceberg, spicy mayo, american cheese"") or tofu (""cucumber, basil, pickles, spicy mayo, hoisin"") sandwiches. 

My friends both gave high marks to the fried chicken; from sight it's clearly a nicely-sized sandwich that's not over-sized for cleverness' sake, yet big enough to be filling and have a great look on the plate.

The tofu sandwich has a soft, flavorful bun and a large slice of tofu, though it's pleasantly easy to eat and didn't fall apart the entire time. I didn't get much of the flavor I was expecting from the basil or hoisin, and the mayo wasn't particularly spicy, though it was tasty.

Both my co-worker and I added some hot sauce he requested which gave the sandwich a bigger flavor profile and complimented the soft bread and tofu well. While this was definitely one of the better sandwhiches I've had in some time I do think they could zap it with some of the more complex flavors their menu suggested.

The kimchi chips were close to BBQ flavored chips though clearly not as processed or as clumsy with strong flavor, and the portion size was right on.

The room itself is small, though the bar is nicely sized and there are excellent window bar-style seats that are likely wonderful in summer and fall.

Luckily when I arrived on a random Monday, it was not crowded at all.  I prefer not to sit next to my companions, so picked a corner of the communal table.
While waiting, I started by ordering a glass of wine for $5, an order of three pork bao ($3 each) and 2 orders of chicken wings ($5 each).  Everything, plus a big bottle of chilled water came within minutes, just around the time my friends arrived!  Perfect.
We devoured everything pretty quickly and then added an order of sticky rice, and an app called gado gado from the regular menu.  The sticky rice was wonderful, well seasoned with just the right crisp to soft ratio.  The gado gado was a HUGE hit.  Beets, hard boiled eggs and potato, in a delicious peanut sauce.  Would absolutely get this again!
Finally, we ordered each kind of soft serve they had on the menu for dessert.  The vanilla honeycomb was fantastic as expected, but the big surprise was the beet and turmeric soft serve with oat crumble.  While skeptical when ordering, it turned out to be one of the more memorable parts of our meal!
Overall, I kind of got over the seating, as our waitress, the food and my company were all wonderful.  If you are looking for a place to sit and face your companion for a conversation, this is not the place for you.  
On the other hand, a person dining solo, would feel really comfortable here.  I can definitely see the HP being a great place for dining on your own!

I was admittedly apprehensive about a white-owned Asian restaurant, but the menu sounded phenomenal. I've been lucky enough to grow up in NYC and travel around Asia, so I've tried many amazing Asian cuisines with their harmonious blends of ingredients and spices, and complex, richly infused flavors. Unfortunately the dishes here lacked the depth of flavors I was hoping to find.

The lobster wontons were kind of basic with no discernible lobster flavor, and the sauce straight up tasted like a slightly bland miso soup. Moving on to the lobster curry, I actually enjoyed this the most. However, it smelled like it would have some tangy, sour notes on top of savory ones, similar to the laksa it's inspired by. Nope. It was savory and spicy but was missing that something extra, so it fell a little flat for me. Still, I enjoyed the noodles and the lobster was cooked very well. The bun cha gio was... fine. The meatballs were a bit tough and dry. This dish tasted like the standard Vietnamese one, although you can find it for half the price elsewhere. I did enjoy the honey soft serve with bittersweet chocolate and honeycomb.

I'd say this is a decent place to go if you have no real options for Asian food around you, but if there are any at all, please check them out instead.

Service is friendly and usually efficient (though we've seen some slow days). This is such a unique restaurant that pulls from so many different cuisines -- I can't name a restaurant elsewhere that is not only so innovative, but nails each and every take.

We had the yellowfin tuna poke ($15), one of the daily specials. It was presented in a very delightful way. We also had the lamb khao soi. While the broth was slightly on the over-flavored side, the dish was balanced and the lamb was a welcome addition.

The oyster ssam was bold, crispy, and also came with delicious kimchi. The chicken wings are unique, crispy, and a great mix of sweet and savory. For entrees, we ordered two of the ramen while my husband opted for the banh mi. 

I'll start off by saying that I did enjoy my ramen and others will like it. I'm pretty particular with ramen and I would have preferred my egg to be cooked longer. I also felt the noodles were on the thick side for a ramen. Both other entrees were enjoyed. On the way out I popped into the women's restroom and I just loved the natural looking sink.

Whether you're seated at the windows, at the communal table, or at the bar you're sure to have a pleasant time. That's what I loved the most about THP: the space.

For me personally, where things fall apart a bit is the food and the service. I came for lunch recently with a friend and there were two servers: one who was working mostly the floor and was very friendly, one who was working mostly the bar and scowled at us the entire time. Guess which one we had? It's always frustrating when you see other customers having great interactions with their server while you're left wondering what you personally did to make yours not like you. Let's assume our server was having a bad day. Unrelated, but why was the music SO LOUD at lunch time? I was sitting directly next to my dining partner and could barely hear him. 

The food I think is beautifully prepared and presented, but it's just not for me. At the suggestion of a friend I got the pickle plate... which was absolutely delicious: I'm pretty sure I could just eat those pickled shiitake mushrooms all day. We also tried the scallion pancakes which were fine, just not especially flavorful, and much more crispy and airy than I was expecting. We filled them with our pickled veggies - just needed some sriracha to make it perfect (I should have asked)! I ordered the tofu sandwich for my main. It's a good banh mi don't get me wrong, but I've had better for cheaper at other places in town. Finally, skip the cake, get the ice cream - GET THE ICE CREAM.

Fry bread with uni butter - amazing!! Must try, we both loved this.

Coconut lime chili wings - Possibly the best wings I've ever had. The sauce on these is amazing. Also love that they're covered in toasted coconut flakes. 

Soup dumplings - These are really good! There's a good balance of the pork and crab flavors in these unlike some other dumplings I've tried where the crab flavor is overpowered by the pork. Just an FYI, these come with 2 dumplings per order. 

Bao bun (filled with smoked char, cream cheese, and capers) - These are really good! Reminded me of a warm bagel ball type snack. There is only one per order. 

Seasame balls (filled with miso caramel apple filling) - Wasn't sure what to expect with these but overall they were good! Served warm. I thought the apple caramel filling tasted a little like a yankee candle but my boyfriend loved these. 

And of course we had the caramelized honey soft serve. I expected this to be super sweet between the ice cream and honeycomb topping, but the dark chocolate shell really balanced it out. Love love love this. Overall we had an amazing meal! Great food and service.

The fry bread with miso butter is sinfully addictive; the vinegary pickled peppers were a nice acid punch to cut the fat. The star of the meal were the lobster wontons.

The service itself was great! Since it was raining outside and the inside was air conditioned, I asked for hot water. The bartender came back a couple minutes later with an adorable metal teapot and small cup, warning me that the water was hot. I appreciated the accommodation a lot!

Two of us ordered the lobster curry, and another ordered the Hokkaido ramen. The lobster curry soup was very good. It had a powerful, sour flavor that you'd expect from Thai-inspired food, and the soup itself was beautiful. I wasn't a fan of the noodles though. I thought they were too soft and didn't add anything to the dish.

I also had some of the ramen. I wouldn't get this, especially for the price ($17). The broth didn't have much depth or complexity that you'd normally want from a ramen. The flavors were just salty and slightly tangy. The noodles itself, I was a fan of, and the egg was cooked well where the yolk was perfectly runny. However, the overall flavor was very meh and not unique. I've had much better for much cheaper.

1077,VNzSaud6CO3LoYqQy7tFXQ,the-honey-paw,1077,2018-07-13,"Stop two on our Portland food crawl....
Another recommendation from friends and family, THP is an Asian-fusion restaurant that populates many a ""hit list"" for foodie destinations here in Portland, and it lives up to that rep, for the most part.  We were lucky that we planned this visit as our first meal of the day at around 12pm because come 2ish the lines formed for all of these clustered restaurants.  As the pictures show, the decor is kind of austere, and the table layout is awkward if not bordering nonsensical.  We arrived to an empty restaurant by and large and at first we asked to sit outside.  The tables for two are minuscule.... certainly not big enough to support multiple tasting dishes that the menu features.  We sat at the sole larger table in the sunny area which could maybe seat three and we were quickly ushered away in case a true threesome would show.  With the wind slightly gusty we went back inside.  The dining area has seats at the bar, seats on the periphery of the windows and a giant island in the middle of the place.  Not knowing where we ""should"" seat ourselves, we sat at the island.  Guess what??????? We were told that there too we were not allowed to sit in case a bigger crowd came...... ummmm what?  The place was empty.  And so, feeling somewhat confused and awkward through this bizarre exchange we cozied up to the corner piece of the bar where there would be enough counter top to order multiple dishes.

The bartender was great!  He hooked us up with a cold dry sake and navigated us through the menu and specials, highlighting what he deemed were the better choices.  See pics: among this array, the papaya salad was a fresh melange of greens, herbs, papaya and peanuts in a luscious and spicy fish based dressing.  The lobster won tons came floating in a savory miso broth with ingots of chili oil (?) and veggies like mushrooms etc.... hands down the best of our dishes.  The tuna dish was slightly light on the tuna and heavier in the cucumber and shaved papaya but the flavors were on point as we found ourselves scooping the veggies into the rice chips that adorned this dish.  The Banh Mi offering was harmonious to the rest of our dishes but I didn't detect the chicken liver mousse that it advertised among the thicket of cold cuts and Vietnamese condiments that topped the meat.  As a huge fan of Kimchi I of course had to sample theirs and it was really flavorful with a great balance of spice, garlic, fish and chili.  My portion may have been a tad over-sauced over the cabbage but the point was well taken..... really really good stuff!!

Now that the awkwardness of the layout is known I would totally come back here to sample what I couldn't today, and now I know how to approach the space.  Hipster vibe abounds here..... over-tatted staff and vinyl turntables for the music.... you know what I mean...... so I'll just put that out there, but the food and flavors are legit!

1078,VNzSaud6CO3LoYqQy7tFXQ,the-honey-paw,1078,2018-07-08,"My first thought when arriving was, wow this place is hipster heaven- besides the menu of pricey trendy Asian/noodles, they have a literal record player with a wall of records to choose from. So if that's your jam, this place is for you.

We started with the Asparagus Salad, which was a refreshing bite of food. I got the Lobster Curry for my main, which was chock-full of lobster chunks and had just the right amount of spice. The rice noodles were wide and short and kept slipping off of my chopsticks, but otherwise it was a tasty, solid bowl of soup. In contrast, the Smoked Lamb Khao Soi had good flavor but barely contained any lamb, a bummer for how pricey it was. 

Food aside, I'm not really a fan that every seat is a high-top (not super comfortable for short people), and your only seating choices are along the bar (which rims the exterior of the restaurant) or one common table- this is definitely not a place to come to have an intimate meal or to have a serious discussion.

There are at least two restaurants that have constant lines out the door and the overflow makes the other places busy too (and great for all of them!). 

However on this particular Sunday we had some friends visiting with Honey Paw high on their list. I'm more of a Highlife at Ruski's at 9am guy myself, but turns out Honey Paw has brunch beginning at 11am, so we classed it up in the name of entertaining and I'm glad we did. 

This was after Labor Day weekend, so it wasn't nearly as crazy as I imagined. We arrived around 11:10 or so, passing the already packed Eventide, and found Honey Paw to be wide open including a nice 4-top outside on a beautiful day. Our server must have seen in my eyes that I had postponed my day-drinking by 2 hours at that point and immediately got us set up with drinks as we pored over the menu. 

I will be the first to tell you I know nothing about Asian cuisine or customs, but the brunch here doesn't exactly overflow with typical brunchy things... I think that section of the menu was about 5-6 items deep and had things like crab fried rice, a noodle dish, etc., but sweet jesus the breakfast sandwich!! It's just bacon, egg, american cheese and some fresno peppers, but the togarashi biscuit is everything. I don't even know what togarashi is, but I think it includes bits of seaweed, maybe chili flakes. It was incredibly good and just as important somehow managed to stay completely intact during the 15 minutes it took me to devour it. I can't count how many times I've had a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit only for the whole thing to crumble apart midway, using a fork to pick at bits of it on the plate. 

Aside from the ""brunch"" section, there's still a full menu. Other things consumed by the group were the papaya salad (wonderful and nice for brunch), lobster toast (wasn't expecting it to be fried, but it's not exactly a staple on the Ruski's menu, so a little out of my element), mapo doufo (wee bit heavy for brunch, but tasty). 

Our server dude was friendly, knowledgeable and never missing for long periods of time, even when they inevitably got busier.

Before sitting, I asked about the Pork & Crab Mee Goreng being served without pork - yes, of course, they can do that.  Great. We ordered a couple delicious apps - lobster wontons (highly recommend) and the masa crepe, which is amazing. I order the Mee Goreng without pork.  It arrives and I do notice a few random things in the dish that didn't look right, but my friend said it's not pork. I keep eating, hmmmm, tastes kinda funny, but I still eat it thinking my taste buds are off and everything in the dish is dark since soy based. I'm basically done and notice what I think is pork - it was pork! Long story short, they admit to the mistake, which is a BAD mistake in any restaurant. They took it off our bill. Not sure where the disconnect was especially since I said twice no pork. I think the chef removed the crab instead since I didn't taste it or didn't seem to see any (again because everything is sautéed in dark sauces) Honey Paw is very busy, loud - I highly recommend wait staff writing down orders.

We ordered the rare beef salad, fry bread with uni butter, the smoked lamb khao soi, and the caramelized honeycomb soft serve.  

You're probably wondering what ""uni butter"" tastes like, because that's what we were most curious about. Disappointedly, it didn't taste like uni.. I was trying so hard to figure out why it was called uni butter. It had a citrus flavor to it! I was confused. However, that was the only thing we weren't too fond of! 

The rare beef salad was amazing! It had so much flavor and the beef tasted so fresh. Each bite was an explosion of flavor and texture. It was my favorite dish. 

The smoked lamb khao soi is a Burmese egg noodle soup and that was really good as well. A lot of flavor in the curry soup, and the noodles were nice and chewy as well. 

We saw the honey soft serve was their most popular dessert, so we had to try it. It had a pleasant honey flavor in the soft serve, and the dark chocolate on top with the caramelized honeycombs added a really nice crunch to it. 

I also really liked the casual layout of the place. There's a giant center table, and bar like seating facing out of the windows along the front of the restaurant.

The restaurant itself is very loud and a little cramped. Definitely hipster. There is one giant communal table and then seats along the window and bar. 

The beer list is impressive. I had a Japanese lager brewed with green tea. My husband had a sour from Allagash. They had plenty of local brews. 

The food is phenomenal. It blew my socks off. It was perfect. 

We had from the $5 ""snacks"" list; kimchi, pickles and scallion pancakes. Best kimchi I've ever had, the pickles included apples and mushrooms which were delicious and so unique, and the scallion pancakes had the same perfect texture as fried dough from the county fair. 

For appetizers we had the charred beet salad with kumquats and the lobster wontons. The beet salad had amazing crispy bits of puffed rice or something. The lobster wontons were delicate and swimming in a delicious broth. 

Next came the vegetarian ramen bowl (can't remember what it was called) with homemade noodles and the star of the show: crab soup with fish cakes. The soup was a coconut lime broth with fresh crab and little fish balls. It was perfectly spicy. Not fishy at all. It is said to have a cult following and I see why! 

For dessert had to get the infamous honey soft serve which lives up to its fame. You could really taste the honey in the ice cream.

Service is prompt and really good in general. Portion sizes are on the smaller side though.

1) Haddock Rangoons: really crispy on the outside. The inside is creamy but nothing that special.

2) Lobster toast: a mashup of a grilled cheese and lobster roll. Really good!

3) Pork bund: a solitary delicious pork bun.

For appetizers, we tried the green papaya salad and Vietnamese masa crepe. The papaya salad was very delicious and quite spicy. The crepe had nice unique flavors (fried mussels, rhubarb sambal, maple nuoc cham) but the shell was a bit too hard/thick and stale tasting. This is modeled after the Vietnamese banh xeo, but the traditional outer shell is a lot more crispy and light and flaky, so I feel that this aspect could be improved.

Then we had the pork and clam mee goreng with chili crab sambal and peekytoe clam, and this was quite delicious. We ended with smoked lamb khao soi. This had some deep flavors and I liked the crispy fried noodles that juxtaposed against the soft noodles, but it was a little too sweet for me b/c they used a lot of coconut milk.

I've never had either dish before and they were both so good! The scallion pancakes were fried but very light and airy so they weren't super heavy - perfect starter. The lobster laksa was crazy-flavorful (in a good way!) and had tons of lobster and these awesome rice noodles I had not had before.

While we were waiting for our food, the music was suddenly turned up very loudly by some customers and then remained there. I asked the waitress if she could turn it down so that I could hear my friends across the table, but she said ""it was broken and we're trying to fix it"" but no one touched the record player after this. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy music as much as the next person, but I don't go out to hear loud, non-family friendly music while eating dinner on a Sunday night. 

The food was served slightly staggered, which I thought was due to the fact that we were a group of 8, but the birthday boy's half fried chicken came out almost 15 minutes after everyone else was served.

1120,VNzSaud6CO3LoYqQy7tFXQ,the-honey-paw,1120,2017-09-01,"Eventide packed so we decided to check this place out. Busy but not overly for a Thursday night. Staff friendly. 

Small draft beer selection but some good stuff. Decent bottle list. 

Lobster wontons were good. I didn't find the dashi broth as savory as desired which made it feel slightly under salted. However the mushrooms in parts were a bit saltier so the combo was fine. Wontons were nice and silky. 

The pork and crab goreng was also too salty. I saw in someone's older pic it was inedible salty. I wouldn't go that far since I ate most of it but it was up there on the scale. The sambal was a little sweet so bites that had more of it were much better.

What I liked least was the texture of the noodles. They are thin and the wok fry makes overly chewy. The menu says house made noodles and this prep really kills that benefit. It could use bigger noodles or less on the fry. 

Wifey got the half fried chicken, plenty for one person and maybe even two average folk with apps etc. This was the star of the show. The brine was tasty. The batter was crunchy and well seasoned. Some of the better fried chicken I have had for sure. Good sweet pickles, really liked them. The chili concoction was much sweeter and looked spicy but had no heat. Otherwise it would have been a great with the chicken. 

Contrast that with the skillet cornbread. Looks amazing but I just don't think the coconut works. Somehow if just gives it an off flavor and the butter wasn't too great either. It certainly doesn't top a classic sweet and soft cornbread with a nice skillet crunch.

I don't find myself in Portland often (far from home) but if in the area I would definitely come back and try some other dishes. The service was fine and the ambiance vibrant. We sat at a bar type counter which runs along the window. Only one bathroom so be careful! Cool sink and clean. Check it out.

1124,VNzSaud6CO3LoYqQy7tFXQ,the-honey-paw,1124,2017-07-25,"Honey Paw is a trendy spot but closes at 10, so we came on the late end.  We checked in with the host and got my number on the waitlist for 2.  We were the only ones waiting, and the link texted to me confirmed that.  We were told to wait 10-15 minutes but at around the 20 minute mark, two guys walk in and claim they had waited 25 minutes and were checking on their status.  They of course did not have the texted link and were not in the system by phone number, which is the only way to be on the waitlist.  The host let them cut us even though they pretty much lied about it, so they were seated at the next two seats inside.  We waited quite awhile longer and were eventually seated outside.  Keep in mind we would have been inside if the guys had not taken our seats (note: Eric R. and I decided what happened at the pizza joint in Terlingua where the two people walked in and essentially stole a family's pizza was worse, so see that review for a crazier story).

We ordered our drinks and food and then it started to drizzle.  These patio tables did not have umbrellas over them.  Our first dish came out, the blue fin tuna sashimi.  We started eating it but I was trying to shield it from rain and I put my appetizer plate over my glass of bubbly to avoid that getting watered down.

Our server brought us and our food and drinks inside.  She pointed to two seats at the bar, but when we got there, another woman who was eating outside took two seats so we were left with one.  There was an empty stool at the communal table in the center of the restaurant, so Eric R. reached for it.  The host came over and told him he would have to stand and not take the empty chair because ""she was saving it for people waiting for a table and the restaurant was about to close.""  Her logic did not make a lot of sense because she said she was seating five people at the bar and only one chair was free, not at the bar.  Because we had more food coming and there was no way Eric R. should be standing and eating when there is a chair available, he moved it to the bar anyway and had everyone to his right move a little so he could fit next to me.  What was the big deal?  We already ordered and were now paying customers.

The smoked lamb khao soi came out next, and it was ridiculously good.  This was Eric R.'s main choice so I tried not to eat much of it but it was hard!  My salt and pepper squid came out next and it was delicious too.  We opted for dessert too, the house-made honey soft serve.  The bartender who served us was very friendly too and the food was excellent.  I was more disturbed that the host let people cut us in line and then yelled at us for trying to take an available chair so we could sit and eat what we already ordered.  She said something along the lines of ""we didn't know it was going to rain so you can't sit inside on this chair"" to him which makes no sense.  I will also note that every time a group came in to ask how long the wait was, she had to go ask other people when that is her main job to figure it out.

Five stars for the food, service was fine but the host was really obnoxious.",4.0,2,"['78 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6595876703614,-70.2510230719194,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Noodles, "

1126,VNzSaud6CO3LoYqQy7tFXQ,the-honey-paw,1126,2018-09-20,"Let me start by saying that the service and atmosphere of this place were great, no complaints. 

The food, while generally tasted acceptable, was so overpriced and overhyped for what it was that I left disappointed. I think if you have zero exposure to a half decent Vietnamese or Thai or Korean restaurant, you might think this place was extraordinary. And judging by the clientele, that was probably the case. The menu is a random hodgepodge of dishes from all over southeast Asia. I'm all good with mixing things up a bit but Vietnamese noodles with Chinese style pickled vegetables, Japanese Ramen and Korean Kimchee just didn't work. Also, the portions were really small, especially for the prices, which are high. 

Additionally, the flavors of the dishes were so tamed and mild that they were neither authentic of any of the countries they represented nor inventive or creative in their own right. I had the Bun Cha Gio which sounded awesome but at the end of the day had very little depth of flavor and the Nuoc Cham sauce was super sweet, monotone and lacking. And the tiny portion of noodles and vegetables for $18 made me feel really ripped off. My wife got the Mushroom Tom Kha which again just tasted like a milder, sweeter, richer version of a mediocre Tom Kha from an authentic Thai spot. Same goes for the Vietnamese Masa Crepe, slightly better flavors but overpriced. I asked for chili sauce (which my Bun badly needed) and it was too salty and unbalanced. 

If you want watered down, unimpressive, overly westernized versions of some potentially awesome dishes, albeit in a nice atmosphere, then it could be for you. I know it's Maine and most of the ethnic food is probably watered down but I wouldn't waste my time. Find me at my local Pho or Korean joint where I could get waaay better food for half the price.",4.0,2,"['78 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6595876703614,-70.2510230719194,"American (New), Asian Fusion, Noodles, "

Here's why it was awesome:
1) The service was great, very attentive, and the food came out quickly
2) The food was DELISH. I went with three friends and everything we ordered we loved, and one of my friends is a very picky eater. I had the mushroom udon noodles it was so good, in my opinion the best of all the dishes we had. 
3) The lobster toast- so I had seen the lobster tartine in a lot of reviews and assumed this was the same thing. NOPE. It was shredded lobster meat fried into a rectangle shape with a lobster and scallop mousse, radishes and greens on top. YUM. Although the lobster flavor didn't really pop out at me, it still was quite tasty
4) Wayyyy less of a wait (no wait at all) compared to their neighbor and sister restaurant Eventide Oyster. 

Why I didn't give it 5 stars:
1) We split the scallion pancakes which were meh-nothing exciting. 
2) One friend got the wok fried rice noodle with chinese sausage, squid and mussels and the other friend got the pork and crab mee goreng. Honestly- they tasted the same, the brown sauce they were sautéed in kind of took over the flavors and you couldn't really taste the seafood in either. The major difference was the type of noodle and the rice noodle was BOMB.COM. Salty too- I recommend drinking lots of water before and after.

I've come here a few times with larger groups, and they're happy to accommodate if their larger table is available. Service is always stellar. These folks know how to take care of customers! They are happy to explain the specials (of which they have several!).
Came here on a rainy Tuesday and was immediately warmly welcomed into the squishy corner table. It was $6 mojito day, so I got the strawberry basil mojito. O.M.G. This was probably the best mixed drink I've had in 2018. Fresh basil leaves, a fruity and delicious rum mix - it was spectacular. And at $6 an absolute steal.
We got their nachos, sans meat, which were great. I loved that they were spicy and had sriricha all over them, in addition to fresh jalapenos and corn.

This is a sort of upscale place - it's great for a date night. I love that they have a ""no kids under 12"" rule... I wish more places would implement that. LOL.
The space sort of reminds me of Timber, but cozier, and with a more laid back vibe. It's fancier than DTL, but a similar layout. As a local, it's probably a rare place for a splurge, but that's what makes it special.

The minute you walk into the North Point, you are greeted with very dim lighting, which makes it a great place to meet up with friends, or have a night out with a date. The venue is fairly small with some tables throughout, and they have a decently sized bar. 

The North Point has an extensive menu of drinks and food. Their cocktails range from a variety of selections, they have an extensive wine list with some local draft beer selections, and the food is centered around small plates with the focus being on charcuterie and cheese boards. They have a large list of cheeses and meats that you can mix and pair.

After coming here a couple of times, I have ordered the Rose Sangria and the extra dirty martini.

In the time since, many others have come and gone (RIP Sonny's and Crooner's), while North Point still stands strong. The point (pun!) is, I think I just didn't get it. 

North Point is a fantastic option for a date night or small friend group looking for creative cocktails and a thoughtful wine selection in a chic atmosphere. It's not trying to be the standing-room-only craziness of Blyth or Hunt, though the cocktails are equally good (and more mainstream). There's twenty cocktails on the menu ($11-$13), consisting quite literally of something for everyone. And you may want to Uber.

 The food menu formerly focused on paninis but has transformed to a wide array of small plates. The cheese and meat selection is the best in town. While not inexpensive at $21-$24, the sizable portion could easily satisfy a group. Pair it by splitting an Ultimate Grilled Cheese or Havana Cubano (both $13) and North Point can be an amazing evening without going into debt.

In the past five years, maybe North Point has changed. Maybe Portland has. Or maybe I have. But there's few places downtown with moderately priced food and crowd pleasing cocktails in a naturally hip atmosphere.

The place is small inside, but we had a nice corner table with 3 bench seats with lots of pillows and 2 regular chairs.

The food - we loved the wasabi peas they give you to snack on. We even asked for more. We started out with the shishito peppers. These were really tasty. I had the ultimate grilled cheese and really enjoyed it. My husband had fish tacos on special and said they were good enough but nothing special. 

The drinks - great drink selection, and I like how they do their beer and wine menus at the table on the glass and bottle - very creative!

I also wanted to point out the decor in here. Lots of neat things to look at. The old time portraits with silly text printed on them in the bathroom made me laugh while washing my hands. ""Afraid of clowns"" & ""Kept her fathers ear in a locket"" were just a few.

Some cons in here. It was sooooo hot and humid the evening we were in here. They had the doors open, and while it was about 10 degrees cooler outside the restaurant was stifling. We all were really uncomfortable, especially once we started eating spicy and hot food. Since it was so hot I was guzzling wafer.

On the other hand, I find it to be REALLY pricy and find the kitchen to be incredibly slow -- even for appetizers and cheese plates!

My final consensus is to pack your wallet, plan a date night with someone who can keep you company while you wait for food and give this place a try yourself. 

For drinks, I suggest the watermelon martini (comes with a watermelon sour patch as your bar fruit Gaga!) or the gin and fresh cucumber one if that's more your style.

OK, I get it, we were three minutes early, but the door was open... Anyway we shopped around for a few minutes and came back at 12:05.  Cute atmosphere, although a bit heavy on chickens and angels.  They have some corner booths that looked very inviting but we were told no can-do so we sat at the bar.  I think the bar may have been designed by Marquis de Sade.  There's not much overhang so your knees bang into the side of the bar and the back of those wooden chairs dig into your lower back.  Jesus, get different chairs.  Tried to start with the prosciutto bruschetta but they were out of prosciutto.  About eight beers on tap, they cover all the basics, nice craft selection.  The first one I tried to order, they had to change the keg out.  No biggie, it happens.  We ordered deviled eggs to start, Mimsy got the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich, I ordered the chipotle chicken tacos.  The deviled eggs were really very good.  The rest of the lunch, however, took 45 minutes to arrive and the place was dead, there were only 10 people in there.  Mimsy said the grilled cheese was pretty much flavorless, and the chicken breast used to make the tacos was so overcooked it was like chewing little bits of baseball glove.  They tasted good, it's just that the chicken was tough as hell.  The bartender was friendly and helpful, although she had not bothered to get her hair in a ponytail before the place opened so she was flipping around these long locks of hair and fiddling with them while taking our order.  It took an awful long time to get what was basically a couple of sandwiches.  I got the feeling that everybody showed up to open the place about 10 minutes before the doors opened.

Couldn't help but notice all the obvious first dates happening around us! It really is a great place for a quiet conversation, maybe some small bites to share, with a slightly-romantic vibe. The lights are turned down low, the benches are cozy with pillows, but not cheezy. Totally chill. 

Wasabi peas are presented immediately as you sit down at the bar. Great marketing strategy because you can't help but eat the whole bowl and your mouth will be on fire and in need of a drink! Interesting cocktail menu, beers on tap and wine. Their draft beer list is printed on a pint glass, and the wine list printed on a wine bottle. I like this strategy as you can really ponder over your drink of choice, and the bartender isn't wasting time reciting.  

Last night I had a $5 raspberry mojhito, without the simple syrup (rum+raspberries was enough sugar). Not sure if this is a Tuesday only happy hour type deal, but it was definitely after 6pm. Its hard for most 9-5ers to make happy hour so its great when you can still get drink specials after 6pm. 

Our bartender was attentive and I felt like she really CARED. Nothing worse than a fake bartender (which are all too common...). 

We also split the spinach and artichoke dip which was just okay. Nothing to write home about. No big hunks of either vegetable which were sorely missed. For $11 also a hefty price tag. Was not blown away but the food last time I went either, but am still intrigued by other things on the menu.

The foot traffic in/out of The North Point (plus the bright yellow paint) caught my eye and the Yelp reviews confirmed this was the sort of place we might enjoy and so after finishing our cocktails we headed over.

As we approached we were greeted by Dan (one of the owners it turns out) who very pleasantly accommodated our outdoor/sidewalk seating request while explaining the menu to us. BONUS! It turns out Monday night is 1/2 price bottles of (select) wine night :)   [We also peaked inside and the indoor side of The North Point looked to be very inviting, too.]

Both my girlfriend and I are cheese and charcuterie fans, so the extensive a la carté meat and cheese choices on their menu made it easy for us to decide to ""make a meal"" out charcuterie and cheeses; plus soup. 

We started with a shared bowl of the ""soup of the day;"" this day a black bean and sausage soup. It was delicious!  Very tasty with big chunks of sausage, vegetables and black beans of course.  We loved it!  

While refilling out wine glasses (which she did whenever they were getting low), our waitress, Langley, who was excellent, heard us discussing the ""sausage tasting plate"" versus ""seasonal paté"" (she's a sausage lover, and I'm a paté lover) as a possible second course before charcuterie and cheese.  She suggested we choose one or two of the sausage choices on the meats menu plus add the paté to our charcuterie board. This way it would be more economical.  So, we had:

Manchego, New England Aged Cheddar, and CranOrgange Chevré plus Ghost Pepper Salami (Langley explained it wasn't as hot as we we feared it might be), Spanish Seranno Ham, and Toscano Fennel Salami--plus the ""seasonal"" chicken liver paté.  All of it was excellent, and served with  the usual, and some unusual, condiments plus toast points. All in all an amazing charcuterie and cheese board experience!  

Coincidentally, while visiting Peak's Island a couple days later we got to chatting with a local couple who listed The North Point amongst their top 3 favorites.  :)

We did enjoy the food, however, and although there were some different and unusual flavors incorporated, we enjoyed that aspect and found all of the wraps/sandwiches to be tasty.

The North Point is great no matter what time you come (with deals both before and after 6pm) but the best time to come is clearly on Mondays/Tuesdays at 5:30 so you can grab some light bites for only $5/ea during HH, followed by their drink deals at 6pm:

On Monday from 6-10pm, they do wine bottles 1/2 off and on Tuesdays from 6-10pm, they serve $5 mojitos! I've tried the mango and pear, both are super fun!

Of course, you can also order beers (all listed on a handy pint class) or wines (all listed on a handy wine bottle) on each table. Happy hour prices apply until 6! The food specials are alright, I've tried the stuffed portobello (almost like mini mozarella pizzas) as well as their chicken skewers. The variety of sauces are fun, but the chicken is a tad on the bland/dry side. Spinach dip is always a winner for me, and for $5 it was very filling!

We sat inside and sipped on some draft beers while we browsed the hefty menu. They also have half price wine bottles on Monday nights!

My two lunch companions ordered flat bread paninis, but I took the riskier path and ordered one of their meat and cheese boards. I was not disappointed. I ordered the prosciutto, Genoa salami, and brie which came with half a soft boiled egg, pickled ginger, fig compote, two different types of mustard, and toasted baguette. The decomposition of the dish was actually appealing and the flavor combinations were unbeatable. Making it more like a savory and sweet meal all in one, I mixed the meats with the baguette and the brie with the fig compote. This was one of the best lunches I can remember. 

I also tried a bite of the the Caramelized Portabella Mushroom Panini with Truffle Oil, Feta, Mozzarella, Roasted Shallots & Sundried Maine Blueberries. The sundried blueberries were a turn off for me on the menu, but flavor wise they were very subtle and it was a smart dish.

A little of everything awaits you here. This isn't a burgers & fries kind of joint, but any palate, from the most provincial to the world-traveled will find something here to enjoy and quell any hunger pangs. The food is simple but impressive: grilled and stuffed flatbread sandwiches contain everything from grilled kielbasa and vegetables to the turkey with mashed and dried cranberries. The Cajun pulled pork is also a favorite of mine; even with my Louisiana blood, it hits home.

There's the mound of North Point nachos, loaded with all the fixins which might be expected. What isn't so expected perhaps is the large menu of cheese & meat plates which could be perfect for a hearty lunch of a light dinner over drinks. The roasted Calabrian figs keep catching my eye though I've yet to try them on any of my visits. Nor have I ventured into the sweet crepe offerings, yet. There'll be time for that no doubt as this little place feels like a mainstay. 

The speciality cocktail menu features everything from a white rum raspberry mojito to a smoked caramel vanilla bourbon. The price points are a bit steep, particularly if you're looking to pair a simple, inexpensive lunch with a drink. They range from $10-$12 so by far, not the most expensive in the area, but getting there. Lunch for two on a Sunday afternoon was two of the grilled stuffed flatbreads and two sodas at $30, plus tip. Again, not the absolute best price in my opinion, but such things are objective.

It was a beautiful day, so we sat outside. We had to ask for the regular things that start a meal like water, place settings and napkins (I erroneously assumed the latter two would come with our food...). 

My cocktail was really good. I got the ginger Germaine which is St. Germaine, bitters, a sugar cube, ginger, and prosecco for $11. They give you a little bottle of prosecco to top it off. Highly recommend this drink. Unfortunately my friend's drink selection wasn't as good. She got the sangria slushie which is rose wine, puréed fruit, rum, and fresh fruit was unfinishable. I've never come across a sangria I didn't like. Avoid this drink. 

Flatbreads! They have a good selection. I had the BBQ pork with coleslaw and mozzarella. It got better and better with each bite (I believe the more I bit into it the better the mozzarella ratio became). Unfortunately I found a large, round, rock-like piece of bone in my flatbread that could have really hurt my teeth. The manager was walking by at the time and remedied the situation with a crepe (which I took to go in hopes of enjoying it for breakfast tomorrow). 

One final disappointment: the crepe menu. It's great that you can pick any two fillings for a sweet crepe, but it's saddening that none of the options are fresh fruit. It's hard to imagine a crepe without bananas or strawberries. We asked to see if they had bananas in the kitchen but not on the menu and they didn't.

""It's really European, Steff, I think you'd love it,"" was what one person said, knowing that I had lived abroad multiple times. ""It's got the same kind of soul you have,"" said another - I still don't know what this means. And finally, ""They've got a quirky sense of humor like you."" THIS, I knew about. I've been a HUGE fan of theirs via social media for some time. Have you seen some of the stuff they post? Let me give you an example of their profound, philosophical chalkboard sentiments:
1. ""I'm on an all fruit diet... well actually just grapes... fermented grapes... actually I'm just drinking wine... it's a wine diet.""
2. ""When things don't go as planned, it's because your plan probably sucked.""
3. ""'Come on... what's the big deal? It's okay... you only broke up with her a few weeks ago. Don't worry so much... it's totally cool... she won't mind... it's only 3am... pick up the phone and ask her if you can come over' - 5 Mojito's""

Today - FINALLY - I gave in and checked it out. I loved the abruptness in which their storefront sits on the cobblestone street. I loved that I was greeted by two separate servers (hostesses?) who asked me how I was doing and paused for an answer like they genuinely cared. I loved that the moment I sat down at the bar, a ""regular"" sitting nearby (an older gentleman, totally sober FYI) engaged in a conversation with me like we were old friends. We talked about how much sexier cats were when they have double paws, how important it is to ""disconnect to reconnect"" and the evils of the internet (segue...), and how he'd like to start a website for sex that wasn't considered porn. He also - very politely - interrupted my conversation on his way out to let me know that he thought I was ""simply fantastic and had great values."" A girl can ride a life-high on a statement like that for many weeks. Please note: he is my new favorite Random in town.

I wanted so badly to try the Smoked Caramel Vanilla Bourbon cocktail, but I was seduced by $3 Allagash's during Happy Hour. My friend had the Cucumber Gin Martini sans simple syrup and I thought it was lovely tasting... ""like what a garden or farmers' market would taste like if it became a drink"" is actually what I said. Lovely manager Kelly said the Maine Wild Blueberry cocktail was very refreshing and appropriate for the state in which we live; she also promised that the sangria was mighty fine as it came adorned with basically a fruit salad. I will be back for both.

The decor? The lighting? The space itself? Yes, all very ""across the pond"" in feel and character (read: charming, cozy, intimate but fun). The staff? According to their website they claim to be ""the friendliest staff you'll ever encounter."" I can't disagree with this - the two guys rockin' the bar (and who we mostly interacted with) were on point, humorous when called for, and very friendly.

The only thing I didn't love here was the food... but sometimes a girl just needs a good watering hole, ayuh? We tried four separate cheeses (1. halloumi [which can only be described as ""insanely sexy""]; 2. murcia al vino [entirely unmemorable]; 3. camembert au povire [definitely interesting - and something I might seek out at a whole grocer]; 4. cambazola [the lovechild of Stilton and Brie]) and while they were tasty, the accoutrements were SEVERELY lacking and underwhelming, and the portion for the price paid was just plain stupid. If it's got enough other awesome stuff going on though (like ambience, amazing staff, stuff drinks, a great happy hour, etc.), sometimes a place doesn't have to win both your food and drink heart over. The North Point has successfully burrowed into my soul (I wonder if they'd let me bring my gnomes in with me next time) and I can see myself coming back here for drinks and hopefully becoming a regular!",4.0,2,"['35 Silver St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.657406877838405,-70.2527466382673,"American (New), Lounges, "

It's a small place on a side street in the Old Port and if you didn't have these reviews or someone who had been there before to recommend it to you you'd probably never stumble upon it. That could be a good thing for fellow Yelpers because if it were on a more public street with more foot traffic this place would probably be so popular that you would be waiting forever for a table. So the secret is safe for now but you should take advantage before the word gets out to the general public!

The colors, artwork, layout, music and overall feel of this place is hard to describe unless you've been there. It is classy, comfortable and interesting. I give it 5 stars for atmosphere.

Then there were the staff. They were extremely friendly, casual and genuinely interested in making the experience a good one. For that I would also give 5 stars. I hope that the owners know how good their people are and treat them with respect because they are such a great asset and tie the whole experience together.

The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars on the overall rating is the food. Don't get me wrong, the food was really good and you can tell they put a lot of thought into it and invested in quality ingredients and a great chef. The problem I had is that I think it is overpriced compared to some of the other great places around. Shaving a couple bucks off of the menu items would probably draw an even bigger crowd and they'd feel like they were getting their moneys worth. Also, I probably say this of a lot of places I visit, a few more craft beer selections would be a plus. :)

I will definitely make this a weekly or bi-weekly lunch spot and if they rethink the prices I will up this place to 5 stars overall.",4.0,2,"['35 Silver St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.657406877838405,-70.2527466382673,"American (New), Lounges, "

We ditched down a side road to escape the sun, and I spotted a new place with funky music blasting to the street. There were tables out on the cobbles that just pulled us in. A friendly waitress drops down some little green wasabi peas and took our order. I asked for the best, most refreshing cocktail they had. A minute later I gulped down one of my new favorite drinks - a Mango Peach-atini.

I've been here twice and both times, left with a happy belly...though the first time I was more impressed with the food than the second time. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the nacho's twice. The second time, I asked to sub the minced beef for something else and the chef improvised some other minced meat that turned out to be really yummy. I LOVE nacho's and The North Point does theirs right. Plenty of cheese, beans, shrooms. Could do with even more salsa and guacamole though! 

Totally would recommend the stuffed flatbread sandwiches, but not all of them are winners. It is totally a panini/wrap/pizza all rolled into one delicious parcel. 

LOVE:
- The Cajun Pulled Pork - Smoky juicy pork. What more could I ask for?? 
- I forget the name of this and it's not on the online menu - but it's got sauteed fruits and turkey in it. SO DANG DELICIOUS!!!! 

Like:
- The Maine Mushroom - great for vegetarians. Very hearty and STUFFED silly with sauteed mushrooms. The dried blueberries add a really unique spin to the flavors of the wrap and make an otherwise, more monotonous 'shroomy flavor take on a new twist.

Meh:
- Smoked Salmon - Would probably pick another sandwich. I normally LOVE smoked salmon, but there wasn't as much salmon as I would have liked, and the fillings just gave the sandwich too much of an earthy flavor. Not my cup of tea, but may be yours...

It's a small darkly-lit place with a quirky yet classy feel to it - like they went to the garage sale put on by the wealthiest family in your town and bought a bunch of random items repurposed as decorations. At first I was creeped out by all the rooster statues lurking above the bar - but then I grew to love them. And you will, too.

Get any one of the pressed sandwiches - you won't regret it. I've tried three, if you count the portion I sampled from my friend during my first visit. All top notch and delicious. Otherwise the menu seems to have a good selection of restaurant/bar food and a cheese plate that I didn't quite understand. I highly recommend getting the Old Fashioned, if the amicable and chatty bartender who looks like Skeet Ulrich is working. They were among the best I've ever had.  They have a full menu of signature cocktails that I would be happy to try on subsequent visits.

During my first visit, my friend and I were sitting at the bar next to the owner. It's really interesting when you hear the thought that goes into a restaurant concept. Everything from the decor to the menu choices to the swizzle straw colors. He's fascinating - and also owns the new steak restaurant Timber.

Before you leave, make sure to check out the bathrooms. They have a wide assortment of hilarious old timey serious-looking portraits with funny superlatives assigned. Definitely entertaining when you're doing your business.  

The only thing preventing me from becoming a regular is that the food and cocktails are a bit pricy - but that's only because I'm a cheap bastard.

We were given a regular breakfast menu and a brunch menu. They had an entire section for eggs (I love anything w eggs). I ended up ordering a beef hash that came with an egg, while my friend ordered the omelette. Both were extremely good. The beef hash was very different from any type of beef hash I've had before.

The waiter was extremely attentive, giving us lots of tips on the menu, that paired with the gorgeous decor and view of Congress street we knew we were in for a stellar time.

Pros-
1. Food was excellent!!!  I had the lighter fair with cheddar cheese. The winter berries in the omelette was genius.  The jam was scrumptious and fingerling potatoes perfectly crunchy on the outside.

2. The restaurant is stunning, fresh flowers on the table and really cool lighting.

3. Kid friendly to a point, they didn't have changing tables in men's the bathroom but they offered my husband a place to chance the baby. They had a bunch of stuff for the kids to play with to keep them entertained.

4. Waiter was attentive and friendly

Cons-

1. Only one the drink prices were out of this world $5.00 for a cup of coffee is insane.  I don't care that it's local and unlimited, the mark up seems to be a bit extreme.

1898,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1898,2019-03-02,"A few weeks ago, a few friends and I decided to meet up at Union for some pre-dinner cocktails. Having never been to Union before, I was excited to experience their venue, as I have walked passed it numerous times.

Upon entering, Union has a modern, American-restaurant aesthetic with wooden floors, modern lighting fixtures and contrasts of black throughout the venue. Union has an expansive bar to sit at with some couch-like bar seating, and a variety of other table seating. On a Saturday night, the bar was definitely popular and busy, which I am assuming is due to Union being in the same building as the Press Hotel. It seemed as though people were coming in to stop for a quick drink before they started making their rounds around the city. 

However, my friends and I opted for the open couch seating by the bar and were quickly greeted by the bar waitress. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and provided AMAZING service. I ordered an extra dirty martini, which was made to perfection, and a couple other friends ordered from the cocktail menu and when they came out, they were presented nicely.

After some time by the bar area, my friends and I figured we might as well stay and try some of Union's dinner options. We were seated in the dining area and again, were quickly greeted by our waitress. Perusing the menu, Union certainly highlights seafood options, which makes sense due to the tourists that stay at the hotel, but they also have a few other protein options beyond seafood. I ended up getting the truffled pot roast, which was served in a small cast iron skillet with vegetables, broth, and some grated horse radish. The flavor profile was amazing and everything was working together nicely. My only negative was that the pot roast was slightly fatty. My friends enjoyed their dishes which included the filet, the scallops, and the salmon.

I ended the night with one of my friends and I sharing the chocolate dolvino, which was a decadent chocolate pudding with pieces of chocolate fudge-like pieces in it. It was incredibly good!

In general, I think Union has a lot to offer. Why not five stars? I think their prices are exponentially inflated for what they are offering. If they brought the price points down on their options, I think they would have even more success, but regardless, I will be sure to be back, even if only for some pre-dinner cocktails and/or dessert.",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "

I've always wanted to come here and when the stars aligned for my birthday and we had a gift card, I knew it was time.

We started out with the cheese plate for $18 which seemed a bit steep for what we got but the cheeses were delicious. I especially liked the cheese.from Fuzzy Udder that looked like brie but wasn't. At the same time, we also got the artisan bread that came with whipped lardo and Casco Bay butter, both a little salty but equally delicious. Did we need all of that? Of course.

For our main dishes, I got the buttermilk fried chicken which came with hen of the wood mushrooms, spoonbread and some dill pickle cauliflower. I am NOT a mushroom person but I decided I was going to try everything. They were delicious and didn't have the slimy texture of most mushrooms. My chicken was very crispy and had a sweetness to it that I really liked. My husband got the sea scallops that came with a succotash and crispy pork shoulder. He cleaned his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed it.

Finally we got dessert because it was my birthday after all! The chocolate budino sounded amazing so we ordered that. Its a rich chocolate mousse with a chocolate torte and some cream. I could have licked the bowl when we we're finished. It was probably the best thing we had all evening. Even better, it came out with a lit candle and they gave it to us for free!

Obviously, I was not part of the planning, but my sister said the restaurant and the event planner were very helpful and good to work with. As the recipient of the festivities, here are my impressions.

Our waitress was excellent.  I made a deliberate effort to  remember her name so I could publicly acknowledge her, but alas, a martini and a good bit of Cabernet Sauvignon ruined that.  Nevertheless she was a perfect blend of attentive and timely.  She always seemed to be there when you needed her but was not intrusive or overbearing.

The food overall was excellent however the complimentary bread was quite boring.  Nevertheless, things improved quickly from there.  I had the veal carpaccio which was plated beautifully and was a wonderful contrast of textures.  Veal might be a touch too bland for the dish, but it still was a pleasant experience.  I chose the truffled pot roast for my entree.  Some members of my family expressed their surprise that I did not pick something ""fancier"" but I had a good feeling about this.  I was definitely right..... beautifully tender meat and a truffled jus that was fantastic!  

Everyone I talked to in our party enjoyed their meals.  Even my finicky daughter loved her chicken dish and even tried the mushrooms that they were sautéed with.

The best of the meal was that my father picked up the tab for the whole meal, which judging by his facial expression was painful.",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "

On a lark, I went here on a business lunch and it's the perfect venue for such an outing. I could see it being a cosy place for two friends sharing a lunch break also. During the day, it does not strike me as romantic but at night, it could be. 

We ordered the truffle oil potato chips with ranch dip for an appetizer and they. are. rich. Do not order these for ""something light.""  They are incredible and tasty; excellent balance of salt and creamy if you use that homemade ranch dipping sauce. A table of four will polish them off, but for two people, it's a challenge. 

For lunch, I got the burger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, cheese, and ""Union sauce.""  It was a great burger, moist and fresh and cooked well. The English muffin as the bun was the let down. It took away from what could have been an outstanding burger! It was dry and flavorless. Give us a pretzel bun or Kaiser roll or just a sesame hamburger bun and it'll make all the difference. The Union sauce was unknown but it complimented the meats/cheese/veggies well. 

It comes with a salad (which after the chips I should have gotten) or fries. I opted for the fries and THEY ARE FRENCH FRIED FINGERLING POTATOES!! Cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly, I was so happy to have gotten them--despite my fried food overload. 

I ordered coffee too. It's good. Have no idea if it's Sanka or Tandem or CBD or what, but a good cup of joe is a good cup of joe, ifyouknowhatImean. 

Our server was delightful. I'd give her a shout out but I can't remember her name. Very attentive-never let our water deplete! A+++ for that.

Started off with the ""local favorites"" seared tuna. $18 for 4 pieces of seared tuna with not enough sauce and too much garlic oil on the slaw. Too many competing and contrasting flavors, dish didn't know what it wanted to be. Skip. 

Then had the braised lobster with corn fritters and Summer corn chowder. I basically chose this restaurant for this dish, because these are three of my favorite things to eat! Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Lobster was cooked perfectly, but the corn fritters were extremely salty and dry. Also no corn kernels to be found! I've found that the best corn fritters often have actual pieces of corn in them. Dish left more to be desired. 

Boyfriend had the crab pasta, which was the best dish we tried. Wish I had ordered that instead. But it came with mint on top, which was very unsettling.

There is a very unique texture to this dish and trust me, you'll go back for more or you'll try hard to make not so perfect pasta for this very reason.

The bowl was small too but even then it didn't taste appetizing to finish.

1916,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1916,2018-07-05,"Absolutely fantastic! Such a great addition to the Old Port. We popped in late Saturday and were able to be seated within just ten minutes even though we didn't have a reservation. I had probably one of the best old fashioneds ever, perfectly balanced and sweet. The crab pasta I had for dinner was absolutely amazing. So pretty and tasted beyond what I thought a pasta could taste like. My companion really enjoyed his swordfish special and said it was the best he had ever had. 

Two things that keep this from being a five star review: The first is that the dessert I had was honestly ""meh"". I had the Union M&M's standing for macarons, madeleines, and meringues. While generous in amount (two of each dessert), each item tasted like it was store-bought and not all that unique. The madeleines were very dry and had no taste to them, while the macarons were hard and crunchy instead of light and airy. Definitely wouldn't order this again. 

The second is that a few days after the dinner went through on my credit card, I noticed that the total of my bill was slightly higher than what I wrote down on my slip. It was just a few dollars more, so nothing that's going to wipe me out, but it does seem a bit dishonest that the server would think its okay to add more money to her tip, when I didn't write that amount down. Maybe pay in cash next time to avoid being swindled. 


I definitely will be back to enjoy the food! But ask to make sure the desserts are fresh and make sure your tip is what you left!",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "
1917,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1917,2018-06-07,"On my recent visit to Portland, I chose this restaurant based on reviews on Open Table when looking for a place to dine. It also was located in our hotel, the Press Hotel.  The restaurant itself has a contemporary feel. There's a dining area and a bar area. I was underwhelmed by the service received at this restaurant.  The young gentleman serving us seem like we were a bother.  As a waitress in my younger years, I notice good service and I expect a server to approach the table and introduce himself. That did not happen.  I was very surprised as we received nothing but special and courteous treatment from the staff members of the hotel. My husband and I started with a couple cocktails from the bar and ordered two of the appetizers. The seared goat cheese and the roasted carrots, both were delicious.  I was, however, disappointed that the carrots only had six colorful petite carrots on the plate.  I ordered the scallops for my dinner and my husband had the special fish of the night. He enjoyed his entrée. I loved the fennel that was served with my three scallops. They were perfectly grilled and tender. Again, the food was good but the service was lacking. I had no refill on my water until after I was finished with my meal.  I expect more from a restaurant that charges these prices. I expect to be waited on by a friendly and attentive staff member who introduces themselves, which did not happen. For my last night in Portland, I wanted this to be a special meal and that is why I chose Union.  The dinner we had at David's restaurant in Portland was so much better as we were treated wonderfully and waited on attentively. I think Union could learn a thing or two from David's management on how to train service staff.

1919,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1919,2017-03-30,"I truly want to love this place.

I just can't seem to make it work, though.

If I was from out of state and was coming to Portland, there's a good chance this is one of the hotels I would end up at. And, who knows, maybe I would check out Union for breakfast (which I *still* hear is amazing years later, and am *still* going to try one of these days) or a cocktail and love it. But... as a local who knows some of the great locations throughout the city for food, drink, and service, this place continues to underwhelm me. Despite the many times I've now been here, I always leave wishing I had chosen a different bar. 

+/- Cocktails 
During the winter they've got this fig and walnut concoction that might be one of the best in the city; unfortunately, they're pretty strict about only making what's on their current menu. Recently I had a $14 cocktail that was 2/3 full and tasted of watered-down lime juice (it was even greenish in color). Frustrating since I bought something that was supposed to be bourbon, apple brandy, and cinnamon simple syrup. My friend's cocktail tasted like a warm melted chapstick. They both were bad enough that after one sip I asked her if she wanted to go to a different bar. I would have liked to talk to the bartender about our drinks, but... 

- Service
At my latest experience, the bartender wasn't personable or attentive at all. At least not to us. We ordered two rounds of drinks, and both times they seemed to come out staggered (we're talking twenty or so minutes between her drink and mine arriving). Beyond that, he wouldn't look at us when taking or delivering our orders - he was fixated on a large group of business men just behind us. Weird thing to note, I know, but it's weirder to be ""talking"" to someone who's looking past your shoulder at other people. And when explaining our drinks and food, he literally walked away mid-sentence (multiple times) to take care of someone else. So... not feeling especially wanted here.

- Food
I still can't wrap my brain around that cheese plate being almost $20. Yes, it's definitely more ample and balanced then it was when they first opened, but I've had cheese plates at nearly every place in town, and have had just as good or better for far cheaper and more plentiful. It's definitely not worth the price tag.

I'm so sorry, Union. I just don't get it. I don't know if it's me. If it's you. If it's me plus you. I will absolutely give it another go, though, because I'm determined to make us work... but first, I just need to get the taste of this lime drink out my mouth.",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "

The food is amazing. The house made bread was great. I'm a huge fan of the free bread anywhere. We had the crab pasta as an appetizer, and that did not disappoint at all.

1922,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1922,2017-03-06,"I'd actually give this a 3-point-something. It was better than OK, but nothing great either.  I'm not sure what exactly seemed to bother me about this place, but it felt like they didn't live up to their expectations. 

For one, it's restaurant week, and they are listed on the Maine Restaurant Week website. When they called to confirm the reservation, and restaurant week was inquired about, the man on the phone said it was the ""chef's surprise."" Oh? Maybe I'll surprise the chef with anaphylactic shock in return. Ok, well, no big deal; one can always ask more questions upon arrival. 

Upon arrival, the table wasn't ready. Fortunately, I am always happy to drink my night away, so I asked for my numbing-concoction-of-choice: Maker's on the rocks. Had I not spewed out that decision at the speed of lightning as I always do, the bartender didn't come back around for a while. Granted, he was busy, just not very personable. Maybe I wasn't there with the right person to enjoy myself. There were couples to my left and right who seemed to be sexually active with one another, so I guess I should just be happy for them. 

When the table was ready, we closed out and moved.  Our waitress was really friendly. She didn't mention restaurant week, but I asked for menu items, and she did deliver. I thought they paled in comparison to all other local restaurant-week menus because there was only one (as opposed to three) options. I think they are a little misleading to say they partake in restaurant week, but then once you arrive it's ""we always have a tasting menu available.""

The cheese plate was eh. I tried the three cheeses and only didn't want to barf on one of them.   One was cheddar-like and the others were very potent varieties, which aren't my taste. The parsnip soup I didn't partake in. The brussel sprouts were great, and my favorite part of the night. Meal: I had the pork shank. It was fine. It was luke warm and under salted, and I could never quite get my waitress' attention, so I gave up and ordered another drink. Other dish: Scallops. They were good, and quite oppositely salted compared to my dish.  Had to say no to dessert, so I can't judge that category.

5 star for service.

What was less than stellar was the food. Given the high star rating and beautiful interior, i was expecting similarly amazing food.

The best things?
- zucchini crab cakes -phenomenal, fresh and not at all oily
- salad - ask delicious and fresh
- burrata - super creamy with a little jolt of weirdness with the presence of raisin like fruit
- salmon - very fresh and well seared 

Okay, not great
- corn with potatoes - this didn't work for me. The corn was light and fresh but the potatoes tasted starchy and mushy and so than texture didn't complement the crisp corn
- pot roast - disappointing; lacked flavor and salt. The root vegetables were bland
- cookies -these ""house made"" cookies tasted like cheap store bought pecan sundies and chips ahoy and Costco madeleines.
- house bread - this is obviously very rustic but was a little too hearty. Felt like I was eating super high fiber spelt bread
- tofu pesto risotto - okay, probably my fault for ordering such a dish but I wanted to try something different. This was a fail - why tofu at all? Wrong texture. Pesto was made from arugula which made it unbearably bitter without the fragrance of basil.

Three of our group started with the Maine Crab pasta as an appetizer.  It is a fairly rich dish and if you order it, you may not want to get a large entree.

For my entree, I ordered the Mountain Trout, and I was not disappointed.  The trout was cooked perfectly and was served with new potatoes, porcini mushroom & asparagus cream sauce.

Another in our party ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and I was told that it was delightful.

I was really intrigued by the homemade venison sausages on the menu, so two of us split that to start, and the other two enjoyed the squash salad. My wine was very expensive at $16 a glass, but it was also one of the best ones I've ever had. For the main course I went with the scallops and clams with pasta and leeks, which I found somewhat disappointing.

I stayed because of the Yelp reviews. I sat in the bar area, a bit cold with the door continually opening and closing. They have a chefs table I could have moved to but I felt bad knowing the tip for the meal would go to someone other than the nice staff who had been serving me.

I was seated by the friendly host and provided with three menus...two of which were for alcohol. I was surprised to see that the only menu available at 1:45pm on a Sunday was the Brunch menu, I always thought of Brunch as being earlier in the day, but I was thankful I had eaten a hearty breakfast of an ""Andrew's Behemoth"" at Fernald's Country Store in Damariscotta two hours before, on my trip from the Lincoln County down in to Portland. 

At Union i ordered the Baby Arugula salad which had a delicate flavor and texture, save for the green tomatoes which were a bit too green and hard for my liking. The charred corn, and other parts of the salad were fantastic though and I would order it again.

I followed this up with the Spanish Tortilla which is essentially an omelette. I subbed chicken for the chorizo as I'm not a fan of pro and found the omelette to be acceptable. I'm not a big omelette fan but it was the only thing that I could get on the menu which is incredibly small - Duckfat has more options. The wheat toast that came with the egg dish however was quite good and there sure was no shortage of mix ins within the omelette which made for a hearty dish. 

I was really looking forward to one of their sandwiches and was very disappointed to not see any of the menu during my trip.

The restaurant was empty except for a 3 top in the dining room. We didn't see a hostess, a waitress or bartender. After several minutes, a bartender (or barback?) appeared and started pouring ice into the bar directly in front of us. He didn't not look up, doesn't say hello, and doesn't acknowledge our existence at all. I see the chef and make eye contact, but he quickly returns to what he's doing.

We patiently wait even longer watching the bartender unload ice and not look at us. After waiting another several minutes, we start to feel completed ignored and contemplate leaving, which we never do. Having come from the restaurant industry, we can make a lot of excuses, but this was unacceptable. 

We walk out with a feeling no customer should ever have, unwelcome. I get that this place is super fancy now, but this is no way to treat any customer, especially ones that would have dined well and probably would have come back if it was as good as they say. 

I guess we'll never know. Good luck getting noticed at this place.

1975,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1975,2017-05-01,"I apologize in advance for the novel, but I want you, reader, to know just how incredible this meal, and very special night, was. 

Saturday evening my fiancé (though she didn't know it yet) sat down for our dinner at Union. First off, given that I'd be proposing at the end of that meal I'd been in close communication with the staff in making arrangements so that this meal would be perfect, and it needs to be said that they were incredibly accommodating and kind through the whole process. 
To that effect, when we walked in, we were met by a very friendly host who led us to our table, where a bottle of delicious sparkling rosé was waiting, chilling, for us. Our server, was bubbly and informative, quickly and easily answered all of our questions and smoothly transitioned us into our meal. 
The first course was a season cheese plate that featured a cloth bound cheddar, a mild yet dynamic bleu, and this incredible triple creme whose name I sadly can't remember (even sadder now that I realize I can't track it down to buy without a name), a fig jam, whipped local honey, and toasted walnuts. That bleu was delicious, but the triple creme was easily one of the most delicious cheeses I've consumed, with the ash line running through its center adding a delightful smokiness. 
After the cheeses we ordered the caramelized lamb belly served over white beans, toasted pistachios, and roasted garlic purée, and all I can say is that if a mouth could orgasm, it would with this dish. The lamb's belly was wound like a pinwheel and had a delightful, sweet, crisp to its outside before you make it to the buttery, herbed, and lightly gamey inner layers. The beans were sweet and earthy and were beautifully complimented by the warmth of the pistachios, and the garlic purée was just that perfect extra touch that tied it all together. 
The mains were equally decadent, flavorful, and intricate. I ordered the chef's interpretation of a Surf 'n turf: seared scallops with braised ox tail, roasted shallots, and some sort of a pea purée. Magic. Pure magic. The brine of the scallops melded perfectly with the grounded sweetness of the ox tail, as the smokey, near caramel, notes of the roasted shallots balanced any remaining bite of the other flavors. All in all, an absolutely incredible dish!
Last but not least, dessert. Having just proposed after the last dish, the restaurant brought out a small, yet decadent, plate of treats for us.

Additionally, the desserts were paired with a lovely sweet Argentinian dessert wine, much like a port, but cleaner.

After a few lackluster experiences with small plate-focused restaurants, I was quick to dismiss the idea of tapas, however, Sur Lie rejuvenated my views on small plate dining. 

Since then, I have been to Sur Lie a few times. I love the aesthetic of Sur Lie, which has a modern, rustic perspective with wooden walls, sliding farm doors, dim lighting, and an open-concept kitchen design. Both times I have come for dinner, it has been quiet with not a ton of people, which also adds to Sur Lie's laid back vibe.

The drinks and food are really well-done, too. They consistently change their craft cocktail menu, and they often try to highlight local distilleries with their alcohol choices. On a recent visit, I ended up ordering the Oh Jeez Rick with Back River gin. It was refreshing and had a nice jalapeño kick to it. As for food, it's suggested that you order 4-5 dishes per two people. My date and I ended up ordering 4 main dishes which included the sweet pea hummus (always a go-to whenever I come!), seared scallops (which were definitely a highlight and perfectly seared), Tonkatsu (the spicy mayo was amazeballs), and the Broiled Spanish Octopus (which was INCREDIBLY tender and good!).

Enter: Sur Lie! We made a reservation for a Friday night at 8:15 to try out their tasting menu. The hostess was nice, waitress was sweet (a bit stressed and short with us, but quite understandable), and the ambience in here is very romantic and pretty. It's also a lot larger than I thought it would be.

They offered vegetarian options, hooray!
For starters, my boyfriend and I both ordered the Maine Board: salami (none for me per usual), gouda, house pickles, roasted garlic
Pretty good. Small serving and the little bread was like a see through piece of tulle. LOL. I think this is my opinion because I am a working-class and unfancy lady not used to it.

Second course: boyfriend got the fried oysters (which came with some big leaves of cabbage which I inhaled since I am a rabbit), and I got the celery & fennel salad.
HOLY MOLY. This salad. Shredded celery (?), roasted pecans, Pineland Farm cheddar, Maine maple syrup vinaigrette. Light, flavorful, a perfect amount of nuts and fresh cheese. The chef actually came out to check on us and I asked him if this is on the regular menu. He said no and I almost caused a scene. I SO HOPE they make this a regular.

For the third course I got the Red Dragon Udon: bok choy, Chinese broccoli, coconut chili sauce. It was spicy and delicious and perfectly saucy. I thought I'd be hungry with tapas, but by this point I was pretty full. Yay.
For dessert we each got a fresh, homemade and warm donut. Delicious.

For a drink I had the Prisoner of Azkaban, which at $13 and tiny was a bit steep, but when in Rome. It was delicious. The hostess at one point asked us to move tables to seat a larger party, and she comped a round of drinks - um, YES, thank you. Stellar service and stellar idea.

I'll come back eventually, I'm sure. I certainly am not the target clientele, but it's fun to feel fancy sometimes.

I love tapas, more specifically, I love being able to taste bits of a variety of foods and share flavors with others. I think I would always eat tapas style if my friends didn't mind sharing!

The highlights of dinner, which I would order again every time, are the Fried Milk Braised Cauliflower, the Pinto Bean Dip, and the Sur Taters! The cauliflower literally melted in my mouth, it was divine! And the bean dip and taters, both seemingly normal dishes, were bursting with flavor. Every dish from the cheese to the drinks was beautifully presented. They serve the plates staggered, so you can enjoy each one on its own, but never have an empty table (until you're stuffed). 

For brunch the menu had a variety of savory and sweet options, everything I tried was full of flavor.  They were generous with the coffee refills, and the mimosa was perfectly boozy. Though I was sad to see that they were unwilling to modify their Fat Boy Breakfast (fluffy buttermilk pancake with bacon, sausage, maple syrup, cheddar sauce, fried egg) without meat for us vegetarians. 

I love that they use lots of local vendors, and certainly made a point to go during Happy Hour (4p-6p daily). Meals can get pricey, but I would recommend to friends for a date night or celebratory brunch!

We started with the sweet pea hummus. My wife and I were starving so we dug right in. Initially we were not impressed but halfway through we noticed the large lemon ?sorbet in the middle. We stirred it in and the flavor got much better.  

Next we ordered the cauliflower which was decent. We then asked our waitress whether we should go potatoes or Brussels sprouts. She recommended the potatoes and we weren't that impressed. Almost like home fries + some cheese and jalapeño on top.  my wife didn't want anymore after 1-2 bites.

2007,FNN-Cf4ME4u1Nkp5D4Swxg,sur-lie,2007,2018-08-27,"Excellent all around!

This beauty of a restaurant is exactly what we were looking for; it is absolutely phenomenal all around.  We walked in and were immediately seated. No reservations, but we were fairly early, so there was ample room.  The hostess started us off with an apperatif - a small, non-alcoholic drink to cleanse the palate between dishes - with a different flavor profile daily.

The menu offered many options listed in sort-of themes: essentially, how adventurous you feel.  Our waitress was very helpful in providing us with details on any dish we asked about, and she was personable and rather excited to talk about the dishes.  She seemed to genuinely enjoy working there, and the vibes she gave off as a result were wonderfully inviting.

All of the dishes were delicious.  My companion was not keen on trying the North Spore 'Shrooms I ordered, but they quickly became her favorite of the half-dozen we tried.  Similarly, she ordered a pork chop that sounded interesting but I didn't expect to like it as I don't tend to like pork; however, it was wonderfully cooked, and that aioli was delicious, ranking it as one of my favorites.  And I would clearly be remiss if I failed to mention the arugula salad as it enraptured us from the start!

So what do you do when a restaurant intrigues your taste buds with every bite?  Order dessert, of course!  We both found something to our liking, and the waitress even smiled when I ordered the Sur Lie Dango, noting that she appreciated my adventurous spirit.  And, oh, did that spirit pay off...  It was absolutely wonderful: delightful to both the eye and the tongue.

Excellent food, excellent service.  I highly recommend a visit!",4.5,2,"['11 Free St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6567972,-70.2575073,"American (New), Bars, Tapas Bars, "

2009,FNN-Cf4ME4u1Nkp5D4Swxg,sur-lie,2009,2018-09-14,"Tonight we celebrated my sisters 30th birthday with dinner at Sur Lie. Many of us had not experienced an environment where it is all small plates (3 menu items is the order recommendation per person). Yet, our waitress Mo was very patient with us which we greatly appreciated! The food was unique and tasteful. Definitely a great spot to try something you've never had before. We must have ordered 18 different menu items amongst the table. Some of my favorites were the honey cauliflower, the brussels sprouts, and the diced potatoes with blue cheese, yum! The coffee cheese cake was amazing as well. And the French Can Can was a delightful drink!

I think our only wish was that we did not have to order all 3 courses at once. There is a recommended order in which they want to send out food, but it came so spastically and seemed just a little all over the place. Had it been a little more structured and everyone got their first course at the same time and then their second course at the same time and so on it would have felt more organized and smooth. But again, we were a 7 top new to the experience so they may have just wanted the order all at once since we were a big party. Most restaurants let you order apps first and think about what to order next, it's a lot of pressure to order 3-4 courses all at once!

But seriously Mo was great! We had no idea what we were doing, my parents especially, and she guided them nicely through the process.",4.5,2,"['11 Free St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6567972,-70.2575073,"American (New), Bars, Tapas Bars, "

Sur Lie is a small plates place, so I wouldn't come here if you're looking to get in and out really quickly. They allow you to order a whole bunch of plates when you first arrive, and they bring each to you as you finish them. We loved every single thing we tried. Some real standouts were the fried milk braised cauliflower (I can't believe the flavors they were able to make happen in this one), the salted roasted beets, the North Spore shrooms, and the arroz con pollo. 

Our waitress was so delightful, and made the whole experience so enjoyable and fun! I wish I could remember her name.

The best dish of the night was the lamb ragu. Small pieces of lamb but the sauce was awesome. I almost ordered a second order of it. We finished with the octopus.

I should note the cauliflower, arugala salad, and potatoes were excellent.  The pinto beans, cheese plate, and swordfish were disappointing.

So why two stars?  Unfortunately, the chef came out to chat after dinner.

2020,FNN-Cf4ME4u1Nkp5D4Swxg,sur-lie,2020,2017-09-24,"We went to Sur Lie for happy hour after reading really good reviews about the fairly new restaurant. I certainly believe that having a happy hour is a sure fire way to get people in the door earlier, plus it's a great value. The more affordable prices let people sample the food and once they do, they won't be disappointed. So, it would be very easy to turn happy hours into many hours of sampling great dishes.

The bar was beautiful and we were served promptly by the bartender, who was professional and serious. We started with beet cured lox with house pickles, roasted garlic, and crème fraîche. The dish was accompanied with really think slices of bread that were chip like but had a lot of holes like bread would. You could see right through them! Everything on the plate worked really well together, creating a sophisticated and delicious taste.

Next, we ordered black bean dip with corn, house bbq sauce, and scallions. This dish came with corn chip strips.  It was evident at this point that everything was homemade. The beans were perfectly cooked and seasoned, which paired perfectly with the local corn. The delicious homemade bbq sauce was the binder that brought it all together. 

The menu prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. It's meant to be tapas style which we like because we rather eat smaller dishes and get to try more of a variety. This is definitely a place to go if you love food and know how to dine.

Sur Lie has a great vibe without pretentious plating and food costs. We really enjoyed our time there and will definitely be back!",4.5,2,"['11 Free St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6567972,-70.2575073,"American (New), Bars, Tapas Bars, "

The menu is small plates designed to be shared and will come out from the kitchen as they are ready. They vary in price from $8-$15ish maybe and you want to order 4-5 plates for two people to have a full meal. Every thing I have tried here is delicious and I've tried a lot of the menu! 

Some of my standout favorites are- 
+The fried chicken- it's always moist and delicious and never overcooked, has a great sauce. 
+Sweet pea hummus- besides this dish being beautiful it tastes sooo good :)) You have to get this one!  That green color though!  0..o

I would recommend getting cheese and or charcuterie, we got a bleu cheese, recommended by our server and salami.

We started with drinks, I got The Order Of the Phoenix which was amazing, just sweet enough, just tart enough and came with a sprig of rosemary.  My friends renamed it the chicken dinner drink (because it smelled like rosemary) but despite that they ordered a few for themselves and it was the big hit of the night. Someone in our party was not able to drink and the bar went out of their way to make fun and creative Mocktails so she could join in the fun.  We ordered so much food it would be almost impossible for me to list everything but the highlights of the night were the Beet Cured Lox, The sweet pea hummus (not kidding we actually put in a second order because it was that good), Fried Milk Braised Cauliflower,and the sur tatters, but everything was amazing.

We had a lovely time.  We also had some great small plates.  And some that were less impressive.  We agree that you can have a five-star experience at Sur Lie...IF you know what to order and what not to.  So here is our advice.  You can't miss the Sur Potatoes, but we suggest you order then with your last round of tapas before dessert.  They are so full of flavor and spice they may actually make other flavorful dishes seem bland if you have them too early.  Do have the sweet pea hummus.  My partner doesn't even like peas but for both of us, it was a highlight.  Order the mushrooms,but earlier on.  They are lovely but may be drowned out next to, say, the Sur potatoes.  We did not have them, but by all accounts, have the brussel sprouts too.  And the scallops are worth ordering just for the delightful sauce.  (We were wishing we had some bread just to scoop up the dregs of that sauce!). Also don't miss the Arroz con Pollo.  We have never had a better chicken and rice dish anywhere.  
We were not as impressed with the Parsnips and Eggs or the Octopus. We have had far better octopus at several other tapas joints.  The Rossejat de Gambos Al Ajillo was also disappointing.  I would definitely return but would try a few different dishes in places of these three.
Also, with tapas, sharing a bottle of wine can be a difficult choice, so you can't go wrong with a sparkling wine.  We had a bottle of sparkling rose and it was lovely.",4.5,2,"['11 Free St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6567972,-70.2575073,"American (New), Bars, Tapas Bars, "

If you're going on your 2rd date and are worried about running out of stuff to talk about, the dishes they serve would probably help stir some conversation. 

I ordered the chef's tasting menu for $55/person and got 4 ""waves"" of food. It's definitely way more than anyone can finish. It's really well worth the price as each dish there is ~$12 and I was able to try like 7 different dishes.  My favorite dish in this tasting menu was definitely the sweet pea hummus dip. SOOOO GOOOOOD though it's not the fanciest dish.

Though in general it's very good food, I'd say it's not the best tasting food I've had because the chef tries out interesting combinations​ of ingredients so obviously some are gonna agree with the pallet and some aren't.

THe cheese portions were so tiny, before writing this review I could see the evolution from 2014 to now, they portions are 1/2 what they were.  Also, appears not much has changed on the menu.  Olive marinade was great except there what appeared to be Kalamata and they were mush, they should know which hold up.

Arroz con Gambas al Ajillo, the prawns were dry and no juice to suck out of the head.  This is why I ordered them, not many places serve head on, disappointed.

The bartender lacked personality.  Also, it wasn't until the second round where we ordered hot plates that he informed us that it would take 15 minutes, that should have been mentioned at first as we would have placed it so the timing was better.

The sausage was nice, it tasted like merguez though the didn't say if it was.  They served the pickle veg with it.  From the 2014 to 2017 pick, appears they did slices before as the tiny cubes were hard to control and get onto the mini slices.  I found they were pretty stingy with the meat, I am not sure anyone could get those slices any thinner, the should enter a contest.

This place seems to be going the way, of a trend I am finding in tourist areas in New England,  more focused on price pointing their food rather than quality to price point.

FOOD is CREATIVE and fun. Sweet Pea Hummus had an essence of mint. Blistered and salted Shishito peppers are the best I've ever had. Hanger Steak was nicely served with thin bread and cheese.

As much as we savored those and others, the CLAM CHOWDER just kicks ass. Creamy base, three clams in shell with a nugget of PORK BELLY surrounds a small mound of hash brown potato.

The DECOR is bucolic French influenced..Simple and classic.  Great music in the background.

2043,FNN-Cf4ME4u1Nkp5D4Swxg,sur-lie,2043,2016-08-05,"Wow.  In a city full of great food options, it can be tough to stand out, but Sur Lie manages to do so without much effort.  Surprised that this spot is more ""under the radar"" than some of the other more popular options.

It's a nice and open space, and once seated, we received a delicious shot of some house made ginger honey soda.  Sure, why not.

The menu was pretty appealing with a lot of options, going from light, medium, and bold flavors.  Each of the dishes that came out had a clear sense of purpose, and a lot of thought behind them. This isn't a small plates place that just puts the ""ingredients of the month"" onto the menu to sound cool, they actually think through what will work together.  I'll just go through each:

Salmon charcuterie: Dynamite.  Everything on the plate was working together, enjoyed each bite and especially the ultra-thin crostini. 

Gazpacho: This might have stolen the show.  The presentation was beautiful, and the flavors were absolutely delicious.  The actual Gazpacho was the best I've ever had, and the fresh tomatoes, balsamic, and goat cheese were all just incredible.  

Sweet pea hummus: Beautiful presentation once again, but not our favorite of the night.  I think that was mostly due to preference, because the execution was definitely there. 

Celery and fennel salad: Delicious.  Crunchy, fresh, zesty, everything you want a salad to be. 

Octopus: Could have been a little better.  Still good, decent flavors, but the octopus itself was a little bland. 

Scallops: This was the only dish where I actually thought they might've tried to do too much at once.  The scallops were super buttery and rich, the potato purée on the bottom was sweet and rich, and then the pickled onions on top.  All together in one bite, it was a little too much going on, but separately, they were all very tasty. 

The meal was also incredibly affordable considering how much we ordered. We came at 10 pm on a Saturday so can't say much about the wait. There was only one other table there at the time. Apparently they also do happy hour if you sit at the bar! I'll be back to try that next time.",4.5,2,"['11 Free St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6567972,-70.2575073,"American (New), Bars, Tapas Bars, "

We started with the scallops, which were cooked exactly right  and served beautifully with pickled accents that complimented the scallops perfectly.  Next came the local mushrooms that blew us away with their intense and interesting flavors.  We followed that up with a smoked pork chop dish that was quite delicious in its own right.  This was easily one of the best meals we had on our trip, and perhaps in many years -- and we've had some great food over the years...

I've been a couple times now and even if you're just looking for drinks and small plates this is THE spot. The price tag is a little up there so if you're money conscious it's probably not the best spot. Their drinks are inventive and secretively boozy (just how I like 'em). Their sweet pea, mint oil hummus is a must. The steak was a fantastic dish, cooked perfectly, and the fried cauliflower is just the perfect amount of brown with a savory and light sauce. 

I wasn't a big fan of the lamb but I'm picky about my lamb. Would I eat it again? Heck yes! Are there more items I should probably try before it comes to that? Heck yes!

I had one of their specials the other month and it keeps haunting me. I think it was short rib but they need to bring it back asap. It was out of this world! The servers are very knowledgeable, friendly and go out of their way to make you feel at home. I've had nothing but amazing service here.

We came on first Friday and it surprisingly wasn't extremely busy. The place is tapas style with tons of options. We started with a cheese/charcuterie platter with Brie cheese and beet cured lox. The lox was so fresh and the Brie came with a sweet yellow mustard that was so incredible. Then we had fried cauliflower with a honey soy glaze - it melted in your mouth and was super light. Then we had my favorite dish that I can't stop thinking about quails egg w/ roasted parsnips and onions. The egg was so buttery and was served in a cast iron pan. It was heavenly. We then had octopus with tomatoes and a chickpea purée which was my least favorite dish - it was a little too savory and salty for me but my mom loved it and it was a good balance with the other sweet things we had. Then we had roasted mushrooms with an aioli and jalapeño which were just the right amount of spicy (barely any) and so creamy!!! We finished with roasted brussel sprouts, almonds and a chili sauce. The whole thing was delicious. They recommend 4-6 plates to share and we got seven and by the end I was stuffed! But it was worth it! I would recommend maybe getting less than we did, but there's so much to try it's hard to resist!

Tonight, we did the four cheese options - with additions like dried apricot with the goat cheese, a sweet jam with the blue, a poached pear with the cheddar, and a mustarda with the soft cow and goat cheese. The light, crispy slices of bread are very unusual and good!

I am not a cauliflower fan, but the roasted, sweet soy version is very tasty. 

This was all followed by fried potato wedges, the scallops, the lamb shoulder, and the Brussels sprouts (without almonds due to allergies). It was all amazing.

I also had Brussels sprouts and poached chicken. The sprouts were ok, the chicken was good. Nice drink selection. 

I can understand small plates take a while to make but had the chef focused on food preparation instead of checking out what was on his phone and chit chat in the dinning room, I'm sure I could've had my food at least 30 min earlier.

We ordered 4 dishes for 3 people, plus beers and cocktails. Very reasonably just around $100 with gratuity. The verdict: all tied for 1st place. Donuts, Fat Boy Breakfast, Broken Egg, and Kedgeree with trout. These merit a breakdown especially because of the--yep, I'll go there--curated experience provided by the very thoughtful chef, Emil Rivera.

Donuts: crispy crusts, taste more akin to fried dough than a typically sweet donut. Sweetness comes in the form of a cream cheese frosting/drizzle. I am less partial to sweets, for me this was perfect.

Fat Boy: quite sweet for me and still very enjoyable. Basically their very out-there (I think) version of a Benedict. A sizzling skillet with a pancake, sprinkled liberally with bacon and sausage, a browned, lacy, Spanish fried egg (very into this) and a light cheddar sauce.

Broken Egg: what it sounds like, over thinly sliced homefries. There were other features I can't recall. This was the deliriously good part of the meal to me.

Kedgeree: spectacular finish with brown rice and spinach. Light, salty, tender. Wonderful way to round out a decadent meal.

All drinks were delicious. Personally I tried the Pied Piper and the Little Bit of Lima. I am prone to like bitter and spicy and herbal cocktails and both satisfied.

The sunny dining room feels much more reclusive than its location would suggest. I do look forward to having an evening on the bar side.

Atmosphere/Ambiance: dim lighting, woods, metals. It's a nice atmosphere to feel like you're having a great dinner in a modern but rustic place. 

Food: I had the scallops, the Brussels sprouts, and the cauliflower. The scallops were perfectly cooked (beware of baby cilantro garnish if you're like me and have cilantro-aversion), the sweet potato purée it sits on is nicely seasoned. Cauliflower was great too. Nice texture and the sauce is a nice compliment but know the honey comes through with the citrus. If you're looking for something savory, this won't be the dish for you. Which brings me to my favorite dish of the three, the Brussels sprouts. It was perfectly roasted, played and the accompanying flavors were superb. 

Drinks: I had the Poseidon's Wrath and another that's name is escaping me. Poseidon's wrath was my favorite of the two and given my liking for not-sweet drinks and bourbon, this was great. Persimmon flavors in it came through without being too tart or sweet.

2075,FNN-Cf4ME4u1Nkp5D4Swxg,sur-lie,2075,2014-10-29,"You know what's more delicious than creative small plates and perfectly crafted cocktails? Creative small plates and perfectly crafted cocktails with incredible customer service (which seems to be the thing new places in town care the least about, because its not what gets them national recognition from food and wine outlets). Sur Lie, without a doubt, has instantaneously mastered the triumvirate of a good night out and for THAT I'm giving them five-stars.

Add on top of that a warm, open space in a more unique part of town and there's very little not to love.

The low-lit, woodsy location is broken into two spaces: there's the long, wide bar on one side that had the biggest, baddest lumberjack looking fella I've ever seen in my life behind (is it weird that I wanted to arm wrestle him?); and to the left was the dining room. We were seated in booths by the windows which was romantic in a way, though I admit a bit chilly.

Our server - Jennifer - was insanely patient, pleasant, and lovely. I used to be polite when I went out, asking a few questions here and there about the menu. Now? I'm outright obnoxious - but it's because I really am genuinely interested in EVERYTHING - the menu, what they like and don't like of it, what's vegetarian (""can you please double check with the kitchen on that?""), the space, the community's reception, the happy hour deals, etc. So when our server first greeted us, I warned her to be prepared for a barrage of direct questions... she handled each with grace and knowledge.

Cocktails: SOOOOOO reminiscent of the bars I've been to in NYC regarding price and size. I had the one-two-punch of perfect autumnal drinks; despite their ingredients, both had the perfect balance of sweet, tart, flavorful, and alcohol-y (if that makes sense). 
- Grey Ghost ($10) - Dickel White Whiskey, Baked Apple & Pear Syrup, Lemon, Angostura Bitters, Pink Peppercorn (love, love, love the addition of the peppercorn!)
- Nectar of the Bogs ($11) - 8 Bells Rum, Vermut, Cranberry Shrub, Decanter Bitters, Angostura (faintly cranberry and verrrrrrry easy to drink!)

Food: large portions than other small plates in town (thank you for that, Sur Lie... small plate doesn't have to mean ""one bite"") and ever-evolving/rotating. We had:
- Sweet Pea Hummus ($7) - THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOODS I HAVE EVER EATEN. Period. My brain exploded in dopamine on that first bite, my heart broke on the last bite, and I have since dreamt about this. It tastes like cold, rich English mushy peas, with a hint of mint oil. The lavash that comes with it is the exact texture and saltiness to perfectly accompany the hummus - and the staff brought us out more lavash when we had run out at no charge. Bliss! Heaven! Yes, please! 
- Pear and Pecorino Agnolotti ($12) - So rich, so creamy, so flavorful! A bowl of this on a cold winter's day could chase away any blues, me thinks. If you like traditional Italian flavors, this will be right up your alley.
- Egg & Tian ($7) - Enh. It's nothing I'd personally eat again. I thought it was a very wet dish along with tasting overly acidic, yet bland.
- Fried Baked Poatoes ($6) - Again, enh. My significant other announced he could eat a bowl of these with a beer for dinner every night and be a very satisfied man, though. I did appreciate the nori dusting on them, though - I think that was a very fun flavor addition!
- Flourless chocolate cake ($7) - I sweet talked my fella into dessert, and we got the flourless chocolate cake with candied orange. This is everything I want in a post meal sweet treat. It was dense, fudgey, rich yet bright and sugary with the candied orange. Just lovely, especially with a cup of coffee!

While Portland is becoming a crowded food and drink market, I think the spill over from other restaurants in town (whether because it's too crowded or you may be disenchanted by it) are going to be beneficial to the new wave of restaurants opening up.

Like all the newer restaurants in Portland, the long bar dominates the main room, though there is a second lower key dining room. The cocktail menu is diverse and fun, with drinks in the $10 range. A smoky mescal cocktail reminded of campfires and was unique and delicious. A whiskey concoction was equally creative. Of the 4 small plates we ordered, only the mussels disappointed. Maybe I enjoy the experience of removing them from the shell, but this shell-less version in a sweeter sauce was only ok. The green pea hummus was the most original take on hummus I've ever seen, and it worked. Fried oysters were great, as expected. The pork belly was the highlight of the night. It disappeared quickly.

The lead bartender looked like central casting from Sons of Anarchy but was the nicest, most knowledgeable bartender I've had in a while. He recently moved from DC and is a great addition to the Portland bar scene.

The salad was dainty and the hummus was good (though not life altering like some reviews suggested - too much hype) 

The poached chicken was blah - a terrible consistency (I like tender, I don't like mushy) but I should have realized that was a possibility with boiled chicken. The shrimp was okay - flavorful enough but not great.

The restaurant instantly feels refined. Manager Adrianne basically conducts an orchestra in a manner you just don't see at other Portland restaurants.

Back Bay Grill is located in perhaps the worst area of Portland, but inside the restaurant is elegant and comfortable. I mildly felt like the elite from every Purge movie, but so it goes. Free truffle popcorn and irresistible freshly baked bread and butter are a fine start to the meal. The menu is traditional large plates, which is so refreshing in an age of small plate mania. Prices overall are cheaper than Fore Street, Scales or Street and Company, with half the entrees below $30. I'm terrible at describing food, so let's just say the famous steak tartare ($15) and duck breast with gnocchi ($35) still monopolize my dreams. The service (in our case the excellent bartender Jesse) is world class. You're paying for an experience at Back Bay Grill, not just a meal, and it won't disappoint. It's unquestionably a top three restaurant in Portland. Just don't park too far away.",4.5,3,"['65 Portland St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.658122,-70.264636,"American (Traditional), French, "
2097,NJPjX_xStmMDm3vSiuX2aA,back-bay-grill,2097,2018-11-18,"It's rare that I'm at such a loss on how to rate a place. I mean, I usually go by value as it relates to taste, quantity and overall experience. No degree of flair, trendy offerings or pretty presentation is ever going to make up for paying several times more than I should for average food. 

Now you know where I'm coming from, and you can judge the usefulness of the review on that basis. The only reason I'm at a loss here is that I try to be fair in my reviews, and I well know that people do not come here for the value, they often come to mark a special occasion. Only, I think there ought to be more to a high-end dining experience than over-the-top prices and an attentive wait staff. Still, Portland is getting gentrified, and everything is pricy. I get it. I tell you what, you decide.

First, let me state that the service was superb, top-notch, I couldn't have asked for more. The waitstaff and manager reflected better upon the restaurant than any other aspect of the experience (the bread was almost tied). The plates were pretty, in that smallish, gourmet style that is on again off again popular, and the menu, while seafood heavy, was somewhat interesting. Oh, and (again) the bread was great!

Know that the portions and menu structure are such that, unless you are a very light eater, you will be ordering an appetizer, salad and entree. I never order more than an entree, typically, as I just can't pack it in like I once could, but the portions are so very small here that you will likely leave hungry if you don't shell out for all three, and, perhaps, dessert.

For example, I ordered the filet mignon, mashed potato and delicata squash for my entree. The filet was the smallest I have ever experienced (and way overcooked, based on what I requested), sitting on a modest smear of fairly tasty mashed potato, garnished with a single (small onion ring sized) ring of squash (also delicious, I think?). The meat texture/taste was unremarkable. This rang in at about $40, and took me under 2 minutes to polish off, eating slowly.

You want a basic cream soup to help fill the void? That's $12, and, again, more a tease than sustenance. Someone in my party ordered a $12 salad, which consisted of 3 romaine hearts, light dressing, several tiny croutons and a few thin shards of parm cheese (there is a picture of this travesty in another review). I have made the same salad from Trader Joes ingredients for under $1 per salad. Having good friends in the food industry, I understand the economics of scaling up ingredients costs, but twelve times the cost is just beyond the pale.

Yeah, it's starting to feel like I'm just crabbing at this point, so I'll wrap this up. It is possible to come in hungry and leave full here, but not for under $70-80, without drinks. If the food was great, it might even be worth it, for that special occasion. That's just not what we found here. I could have eaten at most other places in the city twice for what they charged here, been served better food, and left feeling positive about the experience. If ""special occasion"" means that I must ignore the concept of value or quality, to be substituted for pomp and brand, then I'll politely bow out and cook this same meal at home...if I ever figure out how to get my hands on just one thin slice of squash, that is.

2098,NJPjX_xStmMDm3vSiuX2aA,back-bay-grill,2098,2018-05-31,"So I went here last weekend with the lady as we were in Portland celebrating our 2 year anniversary and her 1 year breast cancer free. Woot *$%@#CANCER. 

This restaurant is very small about 35 total seating/tables available in the dining room and then maybe a 12 top or so bar. (Bartender was amazing) 

We walked from our hotel to the restaurant (maybe not the best idea) sadly the surrounding areas of the restaurant aren't that good (community centers, etc) it was very clear that there were some signs of drug use and homelessness in the surrounding area. With that said, I'd advise to just take an Uber or Lyft to the establishment (our driver confirmed this post departure) was the best idea.

Now that that's out of the way. The restaurant is PHENOMENAL. I literally can't say enough good things about this place, the gentlemen who was running the show was beyond attentive and ensured that we had everything that we needed and that it was up to our satisfaction. They have a number of wait staff that ALL checks in / up on you as well which was really appreciated. 

The food here was nothing short of superb. They make fresh bread in house and honestly, I could just sit here and eat the bread all day everyday. We had the mussels for an appetizer and honestly I'd never had mussels that were so decadent, they melted in your mouth. So good.

We had a reservation, which didn't seem necessary as it wasn't overly busy. They also have free parking available after 5pm just down the street, which was super convenient. 

My fiancé and I like to think that we're wine snobs, but we were slightly overwhelmed by the wine menu. Our waitress was super kind and gave us plenty of time to decide; she gave us space but wasn't completely absent. 

From where we were sitting, I could see into the kitchen area which I found very cool. It was fun to be able to see them preparing dishes before sending them out to be enjoyed. The bar also looked cool and allows you to look into the kitchen. 

We visited during restaurant week and decided to order off that menu, although we saw food from the regular menu go by and were a little jealous. 

Probably the most impressive part of our experience here was actually after we left. I had asked for the other half of my entree to be boxed, but then left before it was given to us (oops). They actually called me (they had my number from our reservation) to tell us that we had left it behind. Thankfully, we were more than a few blocks away and were able to turn around and grab it. It wasn't even a very large portion of left overs, but I'm really pleased that they took the time to call us and offer to hold it for us.

2100,NJPjX_xStmMDm3vSiuX2aA,back-bay-grill,2100,2018-05-10,"This place is on the higher end since but it definitely was all worth it. We decided on this place to end our trip in Maine. We ate seafood for breakfast lunch and dinner for almost a week and this place offered us something different. The filet mignon was on point! Super soft and juicy. It was just the right size too. And the duck, it's been years since I had duck and it was everything I hoped it to be. My parents had a restuarant when I was a child and I could eat duck 24/7 any meal I wanted from the entire menu and I always ate duck. The duck here was definitely different from what I had but nonetheless it was delicious. 

Our server Jesse, was very personable and super nice and easy to talk to. I never felt out of place at all even though it was on the fancier side. My husband had on a tee and jeans while I wore a sweater and everyone else was in nice dressy clothing but we still got treated just the same. 

The creme brulee was a nice dessert to finish off our meal, it had that nice crunch from the caramelized sugar and it wasnt burnt at all. The custard itself had a nice consistency and wasnt overly sweet. Again this reminded me of creme brulees I had back home almost half a decade ago. 

The staff there provided and outstanding dining experience. It wasnt just one person who was with us that night, and all of them were the definition of hospitality. As we left I couldnt help but have a smile on my face, who wouldnt? Great food, full bellies and amazing service.

The service was phenomenal. The courses came out quickly and they kept up with the requests from our big group (10+). They were very attentive and friendly.

In addition, the staff here bent over backwards to accommodate my vegan preferences. The server brought oil instead of butter for the bread and was able to have the chef prepare a vegan rice dish. It was delicious! The almond milk ""ice cream"" for dessert was so yummy. A must try with the blueberries.

My husband took me here while on a birthday weekend trip to Portland. Food was simple, but well done, fresh and great portions for the price. It was in the $30s but the dishes would easily be $40+ in the NY area where we're from.  It's also nice to get a breather from just straight up seafood and in a different part of town. 

Started off with yummy warm bread, and butter (they can refill for you). Then, moved onto sharing a light, yet dry and flavorful Willamette, OR Pinot Noir. They have a big wine list. What we got, was $50 per bottle (Two Messengers). 

Then, we shared the peekytoe crab cake (delicious, meat, big to share) with a yummy tartar. And the crunchy, hearty Caesar with a creamy buttermilk dressing.  Croutons were small and not overwhelming ( a plus). The nice thing about the service was that they split the salad, and the apps for you. 

They change their menu daily. I think eating at 8pm was a bit late for Portland because on a Sat evening, the restaurant was not too busy.  We had such caring, kind, and knowledgeable service.  

I was lucky to grab the last halibut. The portion was huge - got 3 chunks. I think they were just cooking off whatever they had left. They otherwise would move onto scallops. The dish was prepared with a yummy mushroom risotto. 

My hubs got the famed duck breast, also huge, with lots of breast meat and confit. The confit, as usual, was delicious. It said it was brined with lavender but it hardly apparent. I think I liked my fish better actually. But this was good. Came with delicious gnocchi. 

There are many other mains to choose from - filet mignon, stuffed chicken leg, to salmon (it's supposed to be good), to two hearty options. It was yummy all-around. 

For dessert, we shared a decadent caramel sauced, caramel ice cream which came with whipped cream, and an almond lace cookie for yummy crunch.  Overall, I enjoyed it and it wasn't too sweet as the name would suggest. They put a nice candle in it and sent me well wishes along the way. 

Would recommend for something off the beaten path. Apparently it's a James Beard Award winner.

We arrived a couple minutes early but the couple who sat there before us ran over their reservation. The restaurant was very accommodating and also brought us a free glass of wine! It was really appreciated and they truly cared. 

Once we sat down we were served truffle popcorn and bread and butter. The popcorn was amazing. We actually ate all of it. The bread was warm and the butter was soft enough to spread. Our waiter who was also the bartender was awesome. He made sure to constantly check in and make sure to ask if we needed anything without being over bearing. We decided to order two appetizers and they were nice enough to split them on two plates before bringing them out. The crab cake was awesome had the perfect amount of acidity and had a bunch of crab meat through out. Next we decided to have the hearts of romaine salad which they also split. It was the perfect salad. 

For dinner I decided to go with the filet mignon which they cooked perfectly to what I asked. My boyfriend got the salmon.

Very warm greeting from the moment we walked into this spotless, well-run establishment. Fine linens, and exceptional wait staff started shaping our experience.  Everything homemade. 

The mussels were among the best I've EVER had - plentiful for 3 people, served in a KILLER broth, and freshly baked bread straight from the oven.  The mussels were SO CLEAN and plump - really AMAZING. 

I had the duck, a signature dish. Cooked to PERFECTION, crisp skin, the whole thing just melting in my mouth. So many different flavor profiles, but staying true to the dish. Just AMAZING, and most restaurants fail with duck. 

Generous portions, EXCEPTIONAL STAFF, well paced, and DELICIOUS food. Dessert was homemade, and was the perfect ending to an incredible experience.

It's the type of restaurant that can best be described as ""old school."" It's a safe bet to bring Grandma here, but the thing is that they do it really well. Saxophones played in the background throughout our meal. 

We had a gift certificate and being mostly vegetarian, we put off coming in because the menu wasn't all that inspiring. When we arrived we sat at the bar for dinner (it was warm and cozy) and were pleasantly surprised by a menu larger than what is listed on their website. 

Our server was extremely polite without being stuffy. She was all about us not eating meat but okay with eating fish. I really liked her!  

We had a glass of champagne ($9) and a Maine Beer Co Big Bottle ($13). Their wine list was quite impressive if that's your thing. 

We were given the (free) bar snack of truffled popcorn. Omg. This is the best popcorn I have ever had, hands down. 

Then came the (free) bread and butter which was warm, fluffy and just perfect. I could have eaten the whole loaf. 

We had our ""amuse bouche"" of little salmon and cream puffs. (Free) 

Next we split the muscles without the pork belly as an appetizer. The kitchen actually split the order for us so we weren't both hovering over one plate. This was extremely surprising because the order was HUGE. For $13, we were expecting just a couple muscles. 

So at this point, we have spent $13 on food and are pretty much stuffed! 

We each had a salad: the winter greens and baby lettuce. The baby lettuce was basically a Caesar with big shaves of cheese and garlicky croutons. Each component was well thought out and the dressing was delicious. The winter greens came with a hard boiled egg which was perfectly cooked. I think these were each $13. 

For entrees:
-Mushroom linguini which was so so so flavorful. The mushrooms were outstanding. ($18?)
-The Atlantic salmon: huge cut of salmon perfectly seared with what I think was couscous and some kind of root vegetable with baby shrimp. One of the best salmon dishes I have had! ($30?) 

We had to try dessert even though at this point we were busting at the seams. My only complaint is the dessert menu wasn't too diverse (it was old school). It was mostly ice cream which I wasn't feeling.

I went with a decaf cappuccino (delicious) and the vanilla chiffon cake with lemon curd, some kind of vanilla cream, and crumbled almond cookies. It was very good! ($9)

The cocktails are made to perfection and the bartender, Evie, has a quick wit and gives a great recommendation.  I had a cocktail called the Queequog (I have no idea how to spell this) which was smokey and strong.

Back Bay Grill has been a mainstay in the Portland food scene for about 27 years or so.  In that time they have perfected classic dishes and cocktails, grown long term relationships among their staff and developed a warm and welcoming customer approach. 
I have never been to any restaurant where the staff is so accommodating and flexible.  I can see why ""regulars"" return again and again. 
This atmosphere spreads among the customers as well.  I have seen patrons eating alone at the bar, and by the time they are ready to go, have made new friends with the people sitting next to them.
Adrian, the Maitre D', and Evie the bartender are of particular note for their warmth and humor.  Adrian has instinctual people skills and greets patrons at the door in a way that can make you feel like you have finally arrived home for a very special meal.  Evie, aside being a gifted mixologist, keeps a congenial conversation going with those eating with her at the bar.
While anything I have ever ordered off the BBG menu has been incredible, particularly memorable are:
Starters
The Steak Tartare-Do not spend a moment on hesitation!  I often dream about this one!
The Mussels-Pair with some of their house baked bread!
The Crabcake-One gigantic expertly prepared crab cake
Entrees
The Duck-I NEVER order duck anywhere else, but ALWAYS order it here!
The Filet Mignon-Medium rare actually comes medium rare!  A rarity!

The salads are all wonderful as are the desserts 

If I lived a different kind of life (and were not an elementary school teacher), I would love to be a regular at BBG.  I pacify myself with the thought that maybe Back Bay Grill is all the more magical if you only eat there on the most special of occasions.  Regardless, if you are looking for a place to celebrate, or are just plain loaded, call and make a reservation.

2138,NJPjX_xStmMDm3vSiuX2aA,back-bay-grill,2138,2016-10-31,"This is a tough one ..If I could do a 4.5 star rating I would, I'll try to explain. The restaurant is located in a fairly dark (and coming from the East\North side) and somewhat sketchy looking part of down. They explained where could park, and it was both easy and a short walk to the door, but I have to say I was still a slight bit uneasy. As others have mentioned, it's tiny; 30-40 seats max is my guess, and it's in an old building with 20 foot stamped tin panel ceilings and old style lights. White table cloths and fresh flowers are nice for decoration, the mural in the main dining room is .. interesting. 

The menu our night had some of the things other reviewers have said. It's fairly small (several apps, a few salads, and a handful of entrees) but it all looked great. Had the Foie Gras and Steak Tartare for apps, Lavender Duck for entrees, and a dessert that had pistachio ice cream, small chocolate cake (flourless?) and chocolate and rasberry sauces. The food was all terrific. The staff were all (and several visited our table) extremely friendly, and when I had a question about a Rye based cocktail, they brought not one but two varieties of Rye for me to taste. I did end up getting the drink (a burnt orange Rye cocktail) and it was terrific.

I also wanted to mention that the seating is fairly close between tables, but I found the background music, table chatter and kitchen noise to be a nice level where I could talk to my wife fine but didn't feel like we were hearing conversations from the nearby tables. So, drinks, food, dessert and service were all very good. With 3 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 shared dessert I believe the total came to $170. Though everything was very good, I'm not sure the menu and overall atmosphere quite justify that price level. But I do think the service was outstanding. So I'm giving it 4.5 stars.

Nowhere near the flavor you will find in Maryland (or SF).  Duck was exceptional.  Steak was mediocre.  Neighboorhood is very sketchy.

With a $45 prix fixe menu, Back Bay Grill was an opportunity too good to miss. What made it even better was that neither one of us had ever been to the Back Bay Grill - despite having lived in Portland for years. 

The decor was somewhat dated... With artwork that looked like it may have been hung when Bill Cosby was still the king of Thursday nights. But that's really the only criticism that we could come up with.

The staff was friendly and attentive. Our waitress was familiar with both the regular menu and the Restaurant Week menu and was able to make recommendations to us from both. The wine list was quite extensive but again, we were able to rely on our waitress to provide suggestions that really hit the mark.

We both opted for selections from the three course Restaurant Week menu. I got the pork belly for my first course, potato leek soup for my second and seafood sausage for my entree. My date got the local skate for her first course, hearts of romaine salad second and the pork shoulder with polenta for her third course.

Everything was amazing! We shared each dish but couldn't agree which of the first course we preferred. We liked the skate and pork belly equally. The hearts of romaine was the clear winner of the second round... And based solely on its originality, the seafood sausage nudged out the pork shoulder (barely) for the win in the third round.

But, as all the other reviewers have noted, Back Bay Grill is absolutely amazing. The menu is compact but diverse, with at least one selection each covering beef, fish, chicken, lamb and duck. 

After much debate, I settled on an incredible corn chowder with potato, bacon, red pepper and lobster. I'm kind of a corn chowder junkie, but this was definitely in my Top 3. For my entrée I ordered the homemade pappardelle with veal meatballs and pancetta. The waitress brought a spoon as part of my set-up, which seemed strange for a flat, non-twirly pasta like pappardelle. But one taste of this dish, and it all made sense: When the pasta and meatballs were gone, I shamelessly tipped my bowl and spooned up every drop of the dark, rich jus. (Sometimes good flavor trumps good manners.) 

Three courses + two drinks = $90 per person, all in. Worth every penny.

Strictly in terms of food and service, Back Bay Grill would earn 5+ stars from me. But the setting definitely affects the overall experience, and not in a good way.

To be completely honest, I would have given Back Bay four stars (our food was a bit on the salty side) but the service was so absolutely genuine that it would be dishonest of me to give anything less than a five star review. This place knows service, so keep up the great work. 

Dinner: Rare filet with baby carrots and some sort of magical potato concoction, Seared scallops and slightly sweet delicious risotto.

To start, we walked in and were surprised at the small space, but not too small that we were turned away. The distance from the tables to the kitchen was just close enough that we still felt like we were in our own space. The host was extremely welcoming. He even called me twice to confirm our reservation because of the fluctuating weather we had been having. I found that to be very gracious and not annoying. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the price of their drink menu as well. Their meals are a little bit higher than the norm for Portland (AND WORTH IT, but I'll get to that next), but the drinks were a pleasant 8-15 dollar range. 

We started with the mussels as an app (SURPRISE!). They were wonderful. They even split the app into two dishes for us. The homemade bread and butter was also just enough. One more slice I probably would have said it was too much, but then again, it was melt in your mouth bread, so too much is still ok. I ordered the scallops with risotto and roasted beets and my bf ordered the stuffed chicken leg. MIne couldn't have been better, so simple, yet incredibly sophisticated to taste. His chicken was stuffed with an herb sausage that he said was also delicous. We opted out of dessert, as we normally do, but we did notice the aray of sweets that were offered; from cakes, to brule, to several hot toddys. 

The service was top notch. Not once were we greeted without a smile, whether it was to take our order, ask how our meal was or take our plates.

Perhaps because it's not in one of the more frequently travelled to (for me) neighborhoods.  Regardless, I am very happy I finally had a chance to have a meal at this gem.  My wife and I made reservations to sit at the bar on relatively short notice, which works fine for us (immediate beverage service :)).  It also gave us a great view of the open kitchen and the rest of the staff.  All I can say is that the staff at Back Bay Grill including the cooks, bartenders, servers, host and even the guy hand drying glasses are restaurant professionals.  Things were running like a finely oiled machine.  

Might be worth noting that this restaurant has one of the most expansive wine lists I've seen in Portland.  I'm certainly not a wine pro, but there should be something to please just about anyone.  We tried a few cocktails as well and they were delicious.  The bartender was very friendly and happy to talk with us as we ate etc.  

We started off with an order of mussels which was huge and plenty to split with two people.  We were both huge fans of the popcorn with truffle oil and after devouring it all we were like damn now bread too!  My wife ordered the filet which is usually my go to, but I made sure to secure myself some of hers and can say it was a delicious steak.  I almost never order chicken because well its just chicken.  However, the bartender had suggested it to me and I was not disappointed.  The dish was packed with flavor and left me more than pleased.

For cocktails, I had the burnt orange rye something or other which was amazing. She literally burnt the orange in front of us. My girlfriend had the Spring prosecco (with gin, cucumber and lemon juice) which was also good but if you don't like gin that much the flavor does come through. It was quite refreshing though.

2395,L76QknW3NI8KmIXvTq8XBA,the-great-lost-bear,2395,2019-04-15,"I'd been meaning to get here for a long while. Ever since I moved to Portland years ago really. Yet I never seemed to find the time. Always somewhere else to try. Always something else to do. Why place a college dive bar anywhere near the top of my list? And so, the years flew by. 

Today however, I gave it a try. I know one of the bartenders and have been promising to come try for a while. So as we waited for my bike at cyclemania, my wife suggested today as the day. I agreed. Now sadly my bartender friend wasn't working, but it was still an awesome time!

We got there right at opening. Got seated right away, and ordered a drink. I tried one of the many beers on tap, and my wife had the one cider on tap. Kids had water and lemonade. My beer was delicious, is was the RFR, and the cider was also very good. Lemonade our daughter said was really good. So, drinks, check.

Next came the order. There is an EXTENSIVE menu. The bartender I knew recommended the wings, but I'd heard a lot about the cheese fries. So, I ordered chili cheese fries, my wife got the loaded pulled pork nachos, the oldest chose a bacon cheeseburger and the baby got some chicken nuggets. So... the food was ALMOST perfect.

The burger was awesome. Well cooked and very flavorful. The chili fries were amazing. Deliciously meaty and cheesy and sublime when dipped in sour cream. The highlight was the nachos however, or I should say the pulled pork. Do yourself a favor and get everything covered in this pulled pork. So. Friggin. Good. Like addictively good. It's been a couple hours and I'm still thinking about how good it was. 

The only disappointment was the kids chicken nuggets. It was clearly frozen chicken nuggets, like the ones you get at hannaford, and a few fries. I mean, it's ok by the standards of a 15 month old, but the waitress said they were amazing, and that she ordered them all the time. Just, seeing how good and freshly made everything else was, this $8 nuggets and fries was a huge let down. 

The service was awesome. The waitress was attentive but not overly hovering. Which how slow it was, I am sure it was hard not to hover over her only table. She was there when she needed to be, and not when she didn't. 

The restaurant itself is super cool. A hodgepodge of wall signs, photos, news clippings, beer signs, etc. there is is something to look at everywhere you turn. Provided quite a bit of entertainment while we waited for the food. Which wasn't long at all. Only about 8 minutes. Legit. Not exaggerating. If you're in a hurry, this is a place to come. 

Bathrooms, cause it's important, seemed clean and well kept. You can't underestimate the benefit of a clean bathroom. Especially with kids. 

Finally, cost. Cost us $60 for our meal. The only thing we thought was overpriced was the chicken nuggets. Not worth it, don't order it. Aside from that everything matched its value quite well. 

We are excited to go back and try some more menu items, all with pulled pork of course, and some more of the tap specials. I am sad I waited so long to come here. It was delicious and awesome.

I ordered a veggie burger and others ordered cheesesteaks, burritos, fajitas, fish and chips...Theres a lot of variety. The food came out fairly quick but the first thing I notice was the burnt patty on my plate. It was probably 10% burnt on the surface. To me, that tells me its a patty made with low quality ingredients. I took one bite and another pity bite, and couldn't eat anymore. The patty had 0 flavor, tasted like mashed rice and beans, and it was not seasoned, juicy, or anywhere near edible. I have eaten a lot of crappy things, but having ordered a plate that was gonna cost $11 couldn't even force me to eat it.

It IS a tasty combination of meat, onions, peppers, and a really unique cheese sauce--like not a runny, oily cheese sauce, not a processed cheese spread, but a homemade thick creamy sauce with a little tang. So that was new and delightful, but not the greasy meaty treat I pictured. That said, I would order it again--just don't expect it to compare to Pat's, Geno's, or Dalessandro's. Consider it a ""gourmet steak sandwich"" more than a Philly cheesesteak. 

Did I mention the cheese fries?! They cut these huge swaths of potatoes and fry them. Then smoother them in real cheese, not processed cheese goo. They aren't cut like steak fries, more like medallions of tater. Heaven. Delectable. 

My pals got the boneless wings, half order. I cannot imagine one human consuming a full order. Seriously. And I can eat a whole pizza myself.

They have a bunch of interesting beers on tap. After studying the beer list we made our selections -- which we thoroughly enjoyed.

The bar tender was super friendly and provided us with some bumper stickers, a beer list and to-go menu when she learned we were out of state visitors on our first trip to Portland. The gentlemen sitting next to me observed this and struck up a friendly conversation as well.

To be honest, the amount of trinkets on the walls, the lengthy menu, and the way our table was uncomfortably situated, made The Great Lost Bear a rather overwhelming and anxiety-inducing experience.

Fortunately, after putting our order in and getting a few beers, we were good. And the food being tasty also helped. We got the Bacon Cheese Fries to start since we were all starving and wanted some fried goodness to accompany our beers. It's pretty standard, i.e. fried potatoes, cheese, and bacon - hard to mess up.

I ended up ordering the Fried Haddock Roll Up with a side salad (y'know, balance), and it turned out to be pretty good. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their meals. More importantly, they ordered theirs with fries and the cheese sauce on the side. The cheese sauce. Holy moly. Get the cheese sauce.

Each visit is unique in you never know what you are going to get food wise, server wise and time wise. I have been here and had someone take my beer and food order almost immediately, and have also been here and sat very impatiently for 20 minutes before someone even bats an eye let alone takes my order. Extremely hit or miss. I will say that the servers are all very nice and friendly. No one has ever been rude that has waited on me. If you belly up to the bar, you will get the best service in my opinion.
Overall, the Bear has a lot of fantastic qualities starting with their amazing, ever changing, lengthy beer list featuring a wide variety of styles, flavors and origins. 
The menu is decent with an overwhelming number of choices in all categories, but you can always find something you want or are craving. 
I find one thing that is fairly consistent is the deliciousness of their Thai Peanut veggie burger or tempura veggie roll up and the amount of vegetarian dishes they offer.
My favorite app is the teriyaki grilled mushrooms-they have a nice crispy, grilled outside, but are soft and tasty inside. My husband who loathes most things mushroom even enjoys them. His favorite meal to get here is any of their burgers or cheesesteak sandwiches. 
As I mentioned, these are some of the things that make the Bear one of my favorite places.

My wife and I recently met him there for lunch, I couldn't wait to sink my chops into their Bacon with Swiss Cheese burger! I was also looking forward to ordering a 'Flight of five Allagash local brews!'

For starters we ordered The Terriyaki Mushrooms with dipping sauce', the portion is very generous and the taste is outstanding!

I ordered the Bacon Burger with Swiss Cheese, minus the bread, and a salad. Again, delicious!

With my lunch I ordered a Five Flight of Allagash beers. I felt like a kid in a candy shop when our server brought those over! It had been hot outside and I was thirsty, so that may have added to the excellent taste of each one of those offerings, but man, it was like a 'nectar of the gods' going down my parched throat!

I have come to the Great Lost Bear several times now. This place is great if you are looking for a pubby place where you can relax, have a drink, eat some food, and not worry about noise level or having to leave right after finishing your meal.

The food here is pretty average. Everything that I have had has been decent, but nothing has ever been OMG delicious. The menus is VERY extensive, which sometimes cautions me given that it requires so many ingredients for the kitchen to have and may not be changed out frequently. However, given the popularity of this place and how many people they have coming in and out, I think it is okay.

Most recently I ordered the blackened pepper chicken wrap which was pretty tasty. The portions here are pretty good and the prices are also fairly reasonable.

We also got an order of the pulled pork super nachos which were actually really good. I have had the nachos a couple times here and they have always been the best part of my meal.

I highly recommend coming to the Great Lost Bear if you have a big group of people and are just looking to have a fun night. The staff here is very accommodating and does a great job of accommodating larger groups when needed.

The bar is also a great hang out place to just have some drinks if that is all you are looking to do!

GLB is well known for its superb beer list which focuses on beers brewed in Maine. I chose Bissell Bros. The Substance, an IPA. It was served very cold and tasted great. One of our party had the Allagash White, which he loved. 

GLB has a large menu of casual appetizers and entrees. Think burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, chili, nachos, etc. This is not fine dining! I had the fish and chips. I'm not a fan of their bear fries, but the haddock was nicely done, tender and moist, with a very crunchy crust that had very little oil residue. The serving size was very generous; I took some home. My companions had salads, grilled portobellos on spinach, and buffalo chicken on a spinach salad. The waitress mistakenly brought cajun chicken on a spinach salad.

In reality I marched my indignant self over from my office building because El Corazon had just been delivered to my workplace via 2 Dine In and they had forgotten sour cream and guacamole.

I had every intention of paying for these sides but this sweet boy came out of the kitchen a moment later and passed them off to me free of charge. He said it was the funniest thing he'd heard all day and simply asked me just to pay it forward.

While passing an older man stepping into the bank on my way back, I noticed a dollar bill skidding across the sidewalk that he had clearly just dropped from his open wallet. At first I thought I would just keep it since a dollar is so little and this man was likely more financially stable than me. Given the simple but meaningful kindness that had just been bestowed upon me however--I let go of my assumptions in these trying times and notified this gentleman of his recent loss.

Doing the right thing isn't paying it forward of course so I'll still be on the lookout for an extra way I can help return the favor but my perspective had definitely been positively influenced in a world where everyone wants something for something else.

he also had the taco salad bowl thing. that bowl thing is like, made of butter & what was going on inside looked sloppy but he mixed it all up like a pig & was sick from eating all the poppers first.
i had an open face haddock sandwich on rye, it comes with swiss cheese & that's fine but not necessary so i peeled like half of it off. since i'm weight conscious i also skipped the rye bread on the bottom. i think under the fried haddock was a combo of tartar & coleslaw, it was great.
what was really wonderful was the fried haddock. i never order that anywhere anymore cause too little fish inside vs. too much batter, not in this case. the batter wasn't aggressive & it was kind of dark. also, i swear, there may have been a little cinnamon in the batter mix. i won't forget this. on the menu i noticed that they made a big deal of how fresh & special their fried haddock for this sandwich is, that's what i mean by order carefully. so glad i took the chance.",4.0,2,"['540 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6680599,-70.28028990000001,"American (Traditional), Bars, Vegetarian, "

2.  You want to have a completely private conversation with some friends and order some BBQ chicken nachos.  SIt in a booth along the back wall of the bar.
3.  Dammit!  You want to get out of the house with your toddler and order a burger and a beer without disturbing the other diners.  SIt in the dining room.
4.  You just really want a giant order of loaded nachos and a flight of 4 different beers.  Again, try to grab a booth along the back wall of the bar.
5.  You happen to be a person who loves french fries cut in the shape of oval disks and homemade cheese sauce on your burger.  Sit anywhere.

It's just kind of  local place to refuel. It's  nothing fancy,  and nothing for a foodie. You're not trying to impress anyone. Ask yourself:  Have you at least been in a relationship with the girl you met on Twitter for a minimum of one year? Bring her here. Or maybe you're a hangry girl and you just want to stay in your sweatpants all day.  Here.

...Or if your boyfriend just arrives in town and he still makes you slightly nervous so you kind of want a drink at lunch,  here again. You know, just hypothetically speaking, of course.  

What's great here is that no one gives a shit, workers or patrons.  No one is dolled up; no human being visiting here needs access to a mirror to feel comfortable.  It's dimly lit, so who gives a f***? No one is particularly friendly or personable. The waitress didn't tell us her name, but I'd say her name tag would probably say ""Ain't nobody got time for dat""  if she had one. She had no time to wait for answers, you either asked her directly for something, or she was on the move. Often times she kept walking as others would ask her for things. She seems like someone who would literally bark at someone who wasn't moving on a moving walk way, so in that light,  I can appreciate her.

Anyway, It's a cool kind of seedy place. You can pay with bitcoin and everyone looks like they drove in from the mountains. There is a voodoo feeling of weirdness all around. You might actually want to buy a station wagon with wood panels by the time you're done your meal. And you'd have to imagine that at any given time,  at least one wanted person from a murder case 20+ years ago is dining here. Cold case a la mode vibe.

Both of these guys are knowledgeable about every item on the menu; they are personable and charismatic and it was a joy to be served by these two gentlemen.  Our dinner was delicious and served promptly.  We asked Randy a lot of questions about the various beers GLB has on tap and he totally knows what he is talking about.  In fact he let us sample a few different selections of interest and took the time to guide us in choosing several different craft beers, which was both informative and f-u-n.  Portland has a plethora of restaurants; some are old and many are new.

My friend ordered the haddock fish and chips and it looked delicious!! He said the batter had a nice flavor as well, the chips were definitely handcut. I'm getting that the next time I can get in.

Tomaso's is definitely more of a college bar spot but there were more mature patrons in the small establishment well. With space for only about 20-25 people, they turn the tables over quickly. 

We ordered the Tomaso burger, which was an andouille and beef mixture topped with bleu cheese and a bacon, tomato, onion jam and sitting on a bed of pickled cabbage. The bun was a toasted garlic English muffin. We also had a rebel chicken sandwich with sriracha ranch on a honey buttered ciabatta roll, a side of fries, and mutha cluckas, which were bacon wrapped jalapeños stuffed with pulled chicken and cream cheese.

Both sandwiches had a bit of a kick to them and were surprisingly quite good.

So when the burger came out it looked amazing and was just dripping and oozing with yummy goodness. The first bite was great, it was a very rich and savory bite. As I kept eating the burger the flavors were getting a little rich for my liking and I was really craving more cheese on my the burger it only came with a little bit of blue cheese crumbles. For me it was a little too rich and I'm not sure I will get it again. 

After that I had one of their 2$ tacos, the haddock one. It came out in 60 seconds, not kidding. It was good but the after taste was so spicy me kind of over took the taco, but it was 2$ so I really can't complain.

The walls are covered in chalkboard paint with the specials written across.  You can find a shot and beer here for very cheap.  With the rising number prices in Portland, Thomaso's has combatted the expensive tapas style dining that is popping up in so many Portland establishments.  

We had a Sierra Nevada for 3$ during Saturday Liquid Lunch time.  My friend had a Cliff Island Coffee, sweet and SUPER strong for 9$ (a bit pricey, but normal for Portland). 

We also had buffalo shrimp to share and a famous Maine Red Hot Dog wrapped in bacon, breaded and deep fried.  The breading on both was fluffy and light.  Next time, I would order the  buffalo sauce on the side because it caused the breading to get soggy.  

We also split an order of cannoli.  It was 6$ for 2 and they were fabulous.  I'm pretty sure they had a coffee liquor in the filling.

So...when an opportunity presented itself to check out Tomaso's for lunch on a random Friday, I jumped.
I was able to find street parking easily and upon entering noticed that while they were busy, there were still a few tables to choose from.
Our (amazingly helpful) waiter came over pretty quickly to take drink orders.  There were a bunch of beer specials listed under a special table note entitled ""liquid lunch"".  The beers on that list ranged from $3-5 bucks each.  Pretty sweet.  The food menu was both listed on paper and on a chalkboard above the bar.
After asking our waiter for suggestions, we settled on the mozzarella ball appetizer, a haddock wrap with fries for my friend and a cheeseburger for me.  There was no issue at all with asking for the fries to be well done.
While waiting for our food, I was able to get an opportunity to take in the vibe of the place.  I really liked the mix.  This was definitely not a hipster hang, yet while there were clearly hipsters in the room, there were also old time Portlanders and a few people who looked as though they may have spent the last 40 years sitting on a downtown bar stool.  
The food arrived pretty quickly.  We both loved the flavor of the mozzarella ball app, but found it crazily small for $8, especially for a place that is known for a good value.  The cheeseburger, on the other hand, was $7 (with cheese) and was very, very good.  My friend loved her haddock wrap and the well done fries were perfect!
We ended up hanging out and talking for so long, that we ordered a dessert to share.  A Key Lime pie, made in house for $6 which was quite good.  We both loved it and considered ordering another one.
All in all a VERY positive experience, I will definitely return for lunch!  I still might check ahead on a Friday or Saturday night as it is a small space and probably does get packed on the weekend.",4.5,2,"['18 Hampshire St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65987701898721,-70.2514609694481,"American (Traditional), Bars, "

They have food special that changes on their chalk board and we had the pleasure of enojying the dog in a poncho. My only regret is not ordering my own or some to take home. It's a red hot dog wrapped in bacon, dipped in beer batter and fried to perfection and served with honey mustard. The chicken parm eggrolls were yummy, packed with ground chicken, parmesan and spice with marinara for dipping.

Not much more in the way space on the floor because really how much can you do with less than 400 square feet of space but they have tried to add more seating and more stools (and they are in working order!) The bar is awesome, with a modern design and liquor easy enough to spot. 

I did not try a lot of the food but did have an onion ring. Perfect hand cut rings, a good even amount of batter vs. onion, dipping sauce with slight a slight zing. 

Plenty of cheaper domestic beers and craft beers are abound. They seemed to have at least one craft beer that was on special.

They also have great beer + shot specials like the Adult pb&j which is a PBR tall boy and a shot of jack for just $8. They also have a list of locally themed cocktails like the Munjoy Mule which is their spin on a classic Mule, this one features locally distributed Ice Pik Vodka which is incredibly smooth. 

They are open and serving food and drink until 1 am every day, which is a gift to every last caller in the Old Port!! 

I suggest you stop in at any point in the day or night as there is always a group of friendly and/or entertaining customers there but if you are out on a week night looking for a lively bar this is a great place to stop in because it's seats are often filled with locals just getting off their shifts at nearby bars and businesses.",4.5,2,"['18 Hampshire St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65987701898721,-70.2514609694481,"American (Traditional), Bars, "

2770,Kz7pJX-T8EXpVhT1G9Lu4Q,tomaso's-canteen,2770,2016-02-17,"Tomaso's Canteen is a wonderfully SMALL, affordable, and cozy update, the exact opposite of what Sangillo's Tavern used to be: a dodgy, run down dive of ill repute, where most Portlanders were afraid to venture inside, and where every night you'd have about a 20% chance of accidentally getting into a fistfight.  Based on the squeaky clean 'rustic modern' interior - and the new class of patrons who now frequent this place - I'd say those odds have dropped down to about 3%.  It's a great addition to this part of town, which is mostly surrounded by trendier, more expensive restaurants.

When we went around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night, the place was hopping.  Thankfully 'hopping' here means busy, and not patrons crawling over you at the bar to get a drink, obnoxiously loud music, and servers trying to push through you in a crowd to get to a table.  Luckily my friend snagged me a spot at the bar just before I arrived - otherwise every other seat was taken. 

The bartenders are attentive and friendly, and they make their drinks STRONG and fast. I ordered an old fashioned based on positive feedback I had heard.  This ended up being more of a working man's old fashioned (READ: mucho bourbon plus sugar, sans the Angostura bitters). The simplicity was refreshing.  Plus, the bitters just take up the space where more bourbon could be added. The have divey drink specials to offset some of their pricier cocktails, and they seem to have a pretty solid happy hour.  We also ordered buffalo shrimp (served in a classy martini glass!) and bacon cheese fries.  All very good, although maybe a $1-$2 more expensive than they should have been?  My friend ordered a burger, which I tried.  This was also very good, and well priced to match.

3087,YIZHbnnY8TMp7P1RPE8uaw,local-188,3087,2019-03-31,"Came here on a chilly late spring Thursday night with some co-workers and clients. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Local 188 has plenty of private off-street parking, a nice bonus for this neighborhood.

The parking also helps given that the interior is surprisingly large - with a good sized, corner bar on the left facing the street and a large yet cozy dining area. The open kitchen and dark wood makes the space feel more intimate and the size helps with noise and space.

The host and server were both friendly, and the food was all delivered quickly and plated quite nicely. We went with a selection of tapas due to our large mixed group size, though I'm definitely going back to sample some of the dinner-sized dishes as many of them looked great.

I'm not a mussels fan but our table raved about the size of the dish and quality, and the ones I did try -- the pita and goat cheese croquetes - were both above average, with fresh light flavors that worked well together.

Drinks were perfectly made across the board (I got a rye mule that I recommend), though we could've received a bit more regular check-ins there. 

Finally, while I wasn't overly excited at the desert menu selections, our entire group ordered the Crema Catalonia so I joined in. The menu describes it as ""vanilla custard, earl grey, orange confit, fennel jam, lemon poppy shortbread"", and while it was a fresh, lightly sweet and nicely portioned finish to the meal, I do recommend they make their menu description a bit less clever and a bit more direct. You're receiving a small cup of custard with a fennel jam layer on top and an earl gray-infused layer on bottom alongside two thin lemon poppyseed wafers. 

All-in-all this is a place with a sizeable, mixable menu, a warm atmosphere, and friendly service.

3088,YIZHbnnY8TMp7P1RPE8uaw,local-188,3088,2019-03-05,"Yet again, Portland's long lines indicate popular brunches with accuracy. 

The inside of Local 188 is larger than I expected because Portland restaurants are notoriously tiny. It's got charm but I honestly can't identify the style of the place. Maybe classy grandfather chic?

Get an iced chai latte. It's lightly spicy and a great way to start out brunch here. 

The sausage and biscuits main dish is so hearty, perfect for a rainy autumn morning. Sausage is less Jimmy Dean spices and more modern breakfast sausage in flavor, but there's gotta be a half pound of meat in that dish. The two biscuits are dense, moist, and incredibly well suited for the gravy they swim in. Two thumbs up.

3089,YIZHbnnY8TMp7P1RPE8uaw,local-188,3089,2019-01-27,"Well, count me as disappointed. Local 188 was my favorite brunch place for years. A cool bohemian vibe with great egg scrambles, drinks and free parking, this was my go-to brunch spot. $5 mimosas were a Portland bargain and the long waits were worth it.

Fast forward to 2019 and things have changed. Hot Suppa is clearly the king of brunch on Congress St., and Local barely even has waits anymore. Now I see why. Those $5 mimosas slowly crept to $6, and then $7 over the years. Now it's $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a Bloody Mary, which is perhaps the worst value in the city (though the Bloody's are excellent). And the mimosas have pulp, if that's not your thing.

But worse than the downgrade in drinks is the food. Most dishes come with home fries, and my scramble came with an abundance. Four. So did my companions'. Four home fries!!! Did the chef or server eat the rest? I figured it had to be an off day until some friends went a day later. They got three home fries. I'm pretty sure this isn't the Great Famine. And the scramble itself was far smaller than in the past and ordinary. Only the thick english muffin with the perfect raspberry jam was satisfying. 

I just can't recommend Local anymore. The drinks and meals are overpriced for what you get. Portland still isn't a great brunch city, but you can do better.",4.0,2,"['685 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65348,-70.26738,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Spanish, "

The seafood paella: IMPORTANT: THIS DISH IS A 30 MIN WAIT. We were seated right away, and even though there were only a few customers, we were told right away that the paella is a 30-40 min wait. I was ok with that since there was nothing else I wanted on the menu. I'd say it was worth the wait since we weren't in a hurry. I'm not sure if you can call ahead and get the order going before arriving at the restaurant. 

The dish came out piping hot with lots of mussels, clams, but few scallops, shrimps, and pieces of dish of the day. The scallops, jumbo shrimps, and white fish were absolutely amazing. Mussels and clams were small and shriveled. The rice was cooked well. For $39, the portions were more than enough for 2 people. 

The space: Beautiful, spacious, but very dimly lit. Definitely a romantic atmosphere conducive for fancy date nights. 

The service: Very friendly, no complaints. 

The wait: Tuesday night in September, only a few tables were occupied. Again, at least 30 min wait for the paella even with the few customers.

The second time was a month ago and the same thing! Amazing drinks. Friendly atmosphere. Comfy. Wonderful experience. 

The third time tonight was also consistently amazing. I highly recommend this place. Tonight was the first time I have ever eaten here. We had the Montadito, Potatas Bravas and Roasted Chicken. 

I didn't expect the Montadito to be as delicious as it was.  The boyfriends pick. He picks well. Blindly though, he knows very little about food. Haha. 

The Potatas Bravas was good. We asked the bartender what she liked and that is what she said. I would have loved if the potatos had a more salty crust and if the garlic aoili had a maple flavor in it.

Could have just been me but the whole meal lacked a sweetness that I expect in December. 

The roasted chicken was good as well but I personally would have added a sweet flavor which I think they tried to do with the apricot tomato salsa which wasn't my fav. I noticed after that I had none of the carrots on my plate which might be why I felt like this was missing something.

3. Menu is inventive and full of interesting choices.  You can order a main dish or eat more in a tapas style.  I adore sharing dishes so always opt for tapas and the dishes had decent portions and were reasonably priced.  The menu items were creative but also well executed (see item 1 above).

4.  Atmosphere can accommodate an intimate evening with a ""special"" friend or a more casual night out with friends.

5.  Cocktails!  Lovely selection of interesting and yummy cocktails.  I couldn't drink them all (yet) but they all looked positively scrummy (I may be watching too much Great British Baking shows....).

My husband and friend loved their meals, while I seemed to just like mine. In the winter scramble, there were chunks of butternut squash with egg and cheese. It was good, but I just wish it had a little more oomph to it. However, the bloody Mary was really well-made and had a nice kick to it.

3104,YIZHbnnY8TMp7P1RPE8uaw,local-188,3104,2018-09-07,"Dear Local 188,

Thank you for being a dream restaurant for Saturday breakfast for families! I almost don't want to write this review for fear of word getting out... but here goes.

To all the parents out there: Picture this, it's Saturday morning and you don't want to cook breakfast, but your two kiddos are hungry and cannot possibly wait in line for breakfast. You hop in the mini-van and drive downtown while you debate your options, and remember there really is no debate. You pull into THE PARKING LOT and have no trouble claiming one of the open spots. Your crew of 4 skip up the path to the front door of Local 188 where the host greets you and seats you immediately. They have two highchairs ready and offer paper for the kids to color. There is almost instantly hot coffee in your mug and soy milk available, as preferred. You have plenty of leg room, and while there are a few others dining, it is quiet. You place your order and are quickly served eggs with local veggies and the best homemade English Muffin with a side of jam and hollandaise (savory & sweet, please). Your kids are still entertained, your coffee is refilled (twice), the jam is slightly sweet and the hollandaise perfectly creamy, and you are humbled by how easy Saturday breakfast can be. One note: you'll notice I did not use the word brunch, as we eat solidly in the 'breakfast' zone.

I can promise other moms out there: the combination of free off-street parking, plenty of seating, and a simple yet delicious menu provides the perfect breakfast for families. I also appreciate that there are vegetarian options, the big bathroom with a changing table, and the causal, laid-back atmosphere. Yes, it's hipster, but Local 188, you will forever have a place in my heart for family breakfast.

I've been for dinner/tapas too (before kids) and while not the most memorable (maybe I'm just tired), it was a crowd pleaser! Deviled eggs, yes please.",4.0,2,"['685 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65348,-70.26738,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Spanish, "

The food is fantastic.  We had the mushroom scramble special, which included an amazing english.  What's the big deal, its just an english, you say?  Nope.  Epic.  Also had legs & eggs which is a confit, then fried chicken thigh (yes, really), little pot of cheesy grits, coupla eggs and a delicious, flaky biscuit the size of my head.  I needed a moment alone with that biscuit, lemme tell ya.  And then, in order to ensure weight gain, we shared the blueberry pancake.  Are you picturing a delicious stack?  It's not that at all, but roughly 1Kx better.  It's a pancake-y, cornbread-ish cake, baked in an exuberantly buttered little skillet, then anointed with blueberry compote. (i was watching)

If you can, try to get a seat at the counter by the open kitchen and watch these zen masters do their magic.  The staff are delightful, the food wonderful.  Go hungry and enjoy the funky vibe and fantastic food.

Food: we got the goat cheese appt., and that was spectacular. The cheese was on point, warm and creamy. It had tomatoes mixed in which gave it such a refreshing finish. I got the house paella, which to be honest, was a little bland. I had to add some pepper and hot sauce to add some flavor. Maybe I just really enjoy flavor, but no biggie it was still pretty good.

It's a huge space that looks like a mix of a cafe, restaurant, and a small bar. The breakfast and coffee was delicious and we loved being able to see the open concept kitchen as they prepared meals. 

I am not exaggerating when I say this was the best sausage patty I've ever had! Everything was so good that I kept my leftovers and ate them on my layover several hours later. 

My reasons for knocking down the star is because they opened fairly late for breakfast (9am?) so there was a line out front.

Free parking is available immediately behind the restaurant.  The spacious interior features a large bar, upholstered furniture, open kitchen and local art hanging from the walls.  We began by sharing an asparagus and grilled corn salad that included local feta, toasted hazelnuts, radishes and herb vinaigrette. This was soon followed by seared shrimp with arugula, heirloom tomatoes, bacon and avocado puree. Both dishes were delicious, but portion sizes were small in comparison to their respective price tags.  Such was not the case with the house paella that included clams, mussels, chicken and chourico.

This is a really cool place with a very open concept. As soon as you walk in, the entire back of the restaurant is the kitchen which is visible to all guests. It even offers a bar style seating for those to enjoy their meals and watch the cooks. There are many tables situated throughout the restaurant with some couches in the middle for some lounging, waiting and cocktails.

The bar is situated to your left when you walk in. The bar also offers some additional seating for those who prefer to sit at the bar or to just get a drink.

We only took a look at the drink menu which was very extensive. Their drink menu was actually separated by type of alcohol which I thought was really cool. I ended up ordering a chocolate strawberry martini which was absolutely delicious. The other drinks within our party were also very good. There is definitely something on the menu for everyone!

As we sat with our drinks, I couldn't help but stare at all of the food that was being brought out. Everything looked delicious!

When you walk in the door, you can expect to see an eclectic style. From couches and chairs to bar stools to family tables. The bar will always be busy. You can sit at a counter that looks into the kitchen; it's completely open. 

My experiences here have varied over time. The one constant-- the food is something you can always count on. 

Brunch can get really busy, so be prepared to wait. The bar is always open! 

There are two ways to eat when coming to local 188--tapas style or order your own dish. 

The deviled eggs are a staple, so you must try them. The gnocchi is always a solid dish, as is the risotto. I wasn't that impressed with the roasted chicken in my most recent visit.

The sugary surface made the pancake taste as though I was eating a sugar cookie in ""pancake"" form. Order one, and I promise that you'll devour the entire thing.

$9.00 for a pancake may seem outrageous, but it's thick, huge, and so delicious that I'd gladly pay double the price.

I think they have the upper hand because they have more tables and can seat more hungry/hangry people than the other nearby joints, but they take too much of an advantage of it.

Recently, when planning to meet with some friends for breakfast, I suggested it, thinking if we got there early enough, it wouldn't be too packed.  We arrived the following (Saturday) morning at 9:30, and my hunch worked!  While we were certainly not the first people there, there was no wait for a table and we were seated right away at a comfortable table for 4!
Local 188 has a homey feel.  Tables are organized well for comfort and privacy and there is a cozy couch cluster for people wanting that kind of thing.

I ordered some kind of a honeybee brunch cocktail, which was pretty spectacular and my daughter picked the biscuits and honey butter as an app.  The biscuits were ok, not the best part of the meal and the butter did not taste of honey at all.  On the other hand, unflavored butter is still pretty good!  

Honestly, the biscuits were good, and might be considered great in another location.  Unfortunately, Local is across the street (sort of) from Tandem who make biscuits that are  insanely delicious outliers.  This town has an extremely competitive biscuit game!
I kind of wanted to order the pastry of the day, but dammit!, didn't want to risk disappointment again!

Anyway, I ordered the mushroom and herb scramble and my daughter ordered the corned beef hash.  My eggs were great, seasoned really well and served with potatoes (crisp!) and rye toast.  My daughter loved the hash and commented on the positivity of the crispy home fries as well!  Our brunch companions really liked their main dishes as well.

We had an attentive, helpful server and did not feel rushed in any way!

Another plus is that there is parking for the restaurant behind the building and if you get there by 9:30, spaces will probably still be available!

When we left, there was a MUCH longer line to get in (so much of life is about timing!).  
When walking back to my car, I realized how much I enjoyed the brunch scene at Local and definitely planned to return.

The sun was in our eyes which was unpleasant and we were forced to sit side by side instead of facing each other which made it difficult to talk.

The waitress brought me the wrong drink (it was her first day so it was a simple mistake through of chaos). At least the bloody Maria took the edge off the wait. It took about an hour to get our food from the time we ordered it. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito which was terribly bland. The simple addition of salt would have even helped tremendously. It was unpleasant to eat, the only thing that I could taste was the greasy sausage. It should absolutely be completely removed from the menu. My friend ordered the scramble special with fries that were essentially the consistency of burnt toast with little to no potato present. He asked for a fresh side and was brought more petrified potato's. The side of squash from his girlfriends plate was also raw and inedible.

The English muffins were good though from what my friend tells me. 

My hopes are that the manager reads this and realizes that this lost him the service of 3 regular customers. Obviously the staff cannot keep us with the growing popularity of brunch.

Our server (and those who helped him) were kind and polite. Nothing about the service was over the top fabulous - we had to ask for water a couple of times, but overall we were treated well.

The food was good! I say that with a big smile and a little too loud, like I'm convincing myself of that fact. We really loved the shrimp and garlic appetizer - it had the best flavor. There was a chevre app with crusty bread that we liked. The arugula salad was nice, but we wished there was a bit more to it. And the paealla, which I was so excited about and wanted to love, was so rice-heavy, it was hard to get through. It was also a bit on the bland side.

Not tasting quite right would be a theme of the breakfast. His eggs were okay but I didn't like anything that I received. It wasn't even real hash. It was a huge slab of brisket that had a weird taste to it. The home fries and egg over easy had a similar taste so I think a spice combo they were using just did not agree with me.

It's down the block from Hot Suppa, where we had dinner a couple of nights ago.  Happily I noticed on Local 188's website that they have free parking in the back, so Alan was able to pull into the driveway and find a parking spot.  We walked down the driveway to the entrance, which is in front.  I didn't see a back entrance.  There were several potholes in the driveway, each of them neatly encircled w/ white paint, so we were alerted not to step in them.  The driveway is well lighted after dark, so the walk is a safe one.  There is outdoor seating, but not last night.

We walked into the restaurant, which is large and warehouse-like, w/ high ceilings and exposed ductwork.  There is nice art on the walls and an interesting piece of abstract sculpture on the ledge near the window table where we were seated.  Around the sculpture were potted plants.  We were given menus.  There was a drink menu on the table and a little triangle menu w/ Happy Hour drinks on one side and Monday night special half-off bottles of wine on the other.  I opted for a glass of Malbec.  Our server, Liz B, gave me a taste of it because I mentioned I'd had kind of a disappointing one the previous night.  It was good.  Alan had water because he had a beer at home he was going to drink.  We already knew we wanted to share a seafood paella and to order some tapas to hold us until the paella was ready.  We ordered deviled eggs after Alan determined there was no bacon in them to increase the sodium.  We also ordered the green salad w/ buttermilk dressing.  We were torn between the meatballs and the chicken pinchos (spelled phonetically on the menu).  Liz recommended the meatballs and I was pleased because I was envisioning La Marcha's albondigas, which I love.  They didn't have octopus on the menu or we probably would have ordered that.

Liz brought a plate of bread drizzled w/ olive oil, volunteering that normally she sprinkles the bread w/ salt and pepper, but didn't for us.  Very thoughtful.  After a short wait Liz brought the eggs, meatballs and salad.  We were all surprised.  She commented that the kitchen must have been bored to have prepared them all so quickly.  We had expected they would come out slowly, one by one.  We tried the eggs.  Alan found his too salty, so I had the remaining two, which were unremarkable.  The three meatballs were surrounded by a tomato based sauce.  They were firm in texture and just OK in taste.  Nothing like La Marcha's.  The salad was a generous portion and very tasty, w/ interesting lettuces, goat cheese and seasonal vegetables, including something faintly purple and thinly sliced that we forgot to ask about.  We liked the salad the best of the three dishes.  Since the tapas came out so quickly there was a longer wait for the paella.  When it arrived it was gorgeous, crowned w/ mussels and clams, w/ scallops, shrimps and calamari plus a luscious piece of unidentified white fish.  The rice had a nice crust in places.  It was well worth the wait.  It was more than enough for two.  We couldn't even finish it.  The restaurant filled up as we ate, w/ large parties and small.

Now, on to the food. I have to start off by telling you guys how hungry I was. I seriously was starving searching for a restaurant with the best reviews and found this one. First off, the good thing was that they start you off with a complimentary plate of bread with olive oil and salt which tasted delicious. As for the entree, I ordered the Flank steak and it was good... but incredibly small (maybe I just eat too much haha).

3174,YIZHbnnY8TMp7P1RPE8uaw,local-188,3174,2014-08-24,"Local 188 is a Spanish restaurant in Portland, Maine that serves up tapas style dishes. There are a number of great items that you'll be able to find here including a delicious Spanish paella with tons of seafood.

My Overall Rating - 3 1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - Local 188 is a very nice restaurant. It has a very welcoming feel, and you want it you will find a nice seating area in the middle. There are plenty of tables and booths to accommodate any size party. However, one of the best features is something that you do not find often in Maine: parking! There is a private lot that you can park in. It is also free to park. 1 Star.

Service - our server was quite nice; however, what I really like about them was that they were very knowledgeable about the menu. If you visit a restaurant that serves up dishes tapas style, it is all about being smart about what you order because the dishes are meant to be shared. So I really like it when the server is extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, and taking recommends that the allotments based on what you like or don't. 1 Star.

Food - but when it comes to tapas style dishes, there are always going to be some dishes that are said and some that are not. The goal is to try to catch on as many as possible. I did find quite a number dishes that I enjoyed including an excellent Spanish paella do that is loaded with clams, scallops, and even some lobster. They also had an excellent risotto that was creamy and full of garlic flavor. My favorite dish was the gnocchi. This beautiful pasta was a joy to eat as I love the pillow like texture. There were a few other items that we didn't particularly like including the Mediterranean meatballs. I would stick to the seafood items only. Also their carne asada was a bit bland and forgettable. In fact, we did order more tapas dishes but for the life of me I cannot remember what they all were, so they really did not make that big of an impression on me. 1 Star.

Will I Return? - Probably not. This has more to do with the number of excellent restaurants left to try in Portland vs. Local 188's quality.  It was a good but not fantastic/return worthy enough.  Then again, I won't say no if someone suggested it for dinner.   1/2 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",4.0,2,"['685 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65348,-70.26738,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Spanish, "

Also, the one young food runner with red hair was constantly on his phone, dropping his phone in his pants pocket and then removing it to check his messages.

1st time there I ordered a Mimosa. Fresh and delish and not too heavy on the OJ. Just the way I like it. My meal was the field greens and mushroom scramble which consisted of goat cheese creamy goodness, the freshest mushrooms I have ever had, and spinach. On the side were home fries and the WORLDS BEST English muffin. Kid you not. The best. I need to have more. My meal was amazing. So farm fresh and so so good. 
My husband had the legs and eggs. Eggs over easy so he could use the fresh made biscuit to soak up the egg yolk and grits then a big ol chicken leg battered to perfection. 
2nd visit we went back for breakfast again! More English muffins. More fresh fall scrambled eggs this time. Brie cheese. Sweet potato. Butternut squash. And my husband and had the hash and eggs. Everything was amazing. Can't say anything other than that.

I love the gritty diner atmosphere. I love the massive serving sizes, with leftovers-a-plenty. 

There are three things you need to know before going to Marcy's: 
1. Bring cash.
2. Go with 1 other person (Marcy's is too small for groups, seating for 2 is easiest, and if you go by yourself there is no one to share a muffin with)
3. Always get a grilled muffin.

The last couple times I've eaten here I sat at the bar, right up next to the grill. Front row seating for watching the hashbrowns get crispy. I think it's my new favorite spot. The booths are tiny, I'd rather watch the cooks get their groove on. 

Most recently I ordered a special - breakfast tacos - and asked for no meat. Being in my prime spot behind the grill, the owner/chef asked me if I would like to substitute grilled mushrooms. Of course, I said yes, and they were a fabulous addition to the cheesy-egg tacos!

I'm gonna add to it anyway.

YES:
- the servers. Sassy, hilarious, quick, no-BS. Happy to explain menu items and accommodate any guest's needs.
- the food. YAS. This is literally the best hangover food on earth. It is deliciously greasy, and they provide a bunch of hot sauces for the table. The serving sizes are INSANE. Come with your appetite. Their French toast is among the best. And their pancakes. The pancakes are the size of a serving platter.
- the prices. SO. DAMN. REASONABLE. Like, you can order half the menu and it'll still be reasonable.
- the location/feel. It's small, you're lucky to get a table. You're lucky if you get a bar seat! Just feel lucky you even get to be in here. It's authentic and great.
- their homemade muffins. HOLY MOLY. They make special muffins, so be sure to grab one before they're totally sold out. And make sure to ask for them grilled- they cut the muffin in half and grill it in butter until it's crispy. IT IS AMAZING.
- coffee/tea: if you order one with your meal, they'll give you one to go after you finish eating! Last time I came here I ordered an iced tea, and on my way out the door they gave me a brand new, fresh iced tea. This is so stellar. Above and beyond. Nowhere else does this!

EH...:
- cash only. Luckily Mathew's, the dive bar next door, allows patrons to use their ATM. Wish they had one here though.
- the wait: can be super duper long. In the spring/summer, it's lovely, as they have a little bench outside. In the winter, it's pretty dreadful to wait. Really depends on how much you want some delicious Marcy's.

Get lunch or breakfast or brunch here. It is filling, delicious, and entertaining. Don't be offended when they bring your check over before you ask for it- this is a quick service place. It's casual, a great meet-up spot for locals, and makes you feel like you're getting an authentic diner experience.

But it's a small place so I'd recommend coming early or else you might have to wait.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, and service is attentive and fast.  It's your typical greasy spoon diner but everything is really well done, satisfying and portions are huge. 

We started off with one of their muffins (grilled which meant toasted and warmed). Highly recommend. They are very tasty. Kind of like corn bread. The special they had was the Tres Lesches which was delish because it came with a three milks sauce to dunk.  The muffin was very top heavy; the top being crumbed. I didn't try this part too much but the body was very yum. 

I then had the meal that included: silver dollar pancakes (warning. These are fluffy huge size pancakes; I could only eat a slither), eggs of your choice (got a wet scramble), bacon (They only give you two strips of your meat choice - which was fine by me but just fyi), and hashbrowns, which are shredded - my fave. You can upgrade to ""hobo"" style which is with onion, jalapeno and cheese (I opted out of the cheese). 

My husband got an option that came with eggs (perfect done sunnys, he said), sausage (not the gross shrunken kind), and rye toast.

Highly recommend for an early breakfast to start off the day and taking a seafood break. Many people were eating the fluffy pancakes.",4.5,1,"['47 Oak St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6550091209133,-70.26129159023479,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Diners, "

There was thankfully a seat open so we didn't have to wait at all. Once we sat down our waitress came over to introduce herself. 

We took a look over the menu and decided to get blueberry pancakes and Cap'n Crunch coated French toast. The waitress warned us that the pancakes were big and she wasn't lying lol. The food came out relatively fast and they played good music throughout our time there. 

The blueberry pancakes were delicious and had plenty of blueberries in them. The Cap'n Crunch French toast was amazing. If you have a sweet tooth I suggest you try it. 

We were here for about 30 minutes. The total was about $20 for two pancakes, two French toast, coffee and a side of bacon. Not bad! I would definitely come back here when I'm in town.

We were seated right away, told the specials, and then left to make our decisions. I got one pancake with bacon (IN THE PANCAKE!) and a side of hash browns. THE PANCAKE WAS THE SIZE OF THE *PAPER* PLATE. I was honestly shocked, amazed, and delighted at the portion. I couldn't finish the whole thing, but who doesn't love a toasted leftover pancake? The hash browns were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My dining companion ordered french toast, a side of bacon (6 PIECES), and hash browns. He was equally pleased with his meal. 

A couple things to keep in mind: service was kind of slow, but I think this is due to the small space, so I'm guessing tiny kitchen? Marcy's is also cash only!

We were told before we sat down that they were short staffed and only serving the front page of the menu, but the guy said ""Don't worry, it's all the good stuff"", and he was right. Ordered two banana walnut pancakes, hash browns, eggs, and sausage. Pancakes- delicious. So generous with the walnuts and banana. Hash browns and sausage were excellent. I don't like eggs so I passed them off to my partner. I can't even remember what he ordered because I was too busy stuffing my face.

There is definitely a locals feel to this place, which is a good and a bad thing. The good: they know many customers by name and what they will order.  The bad: if you're not a local you catch yourself looking around trying not to miss anything that's happening. 

We only come here on snow days to ensure that there won't be a wait. It has paid off for us during the last 4 visits. But rumor has it that the wait could get pretty lengthy especially on the weekends. 

The service deserves 5 stars. The staff will greet you once they see your hand on the handle to open the door. You will be served, refilled, and checked on by any and all of the people behind the counter. 

They always have specials written on the board, we always give those a try.  Depending on how busy they are or the time of day, they will run out of certain items. The muffins they serve are homemade. You have the choice to get it grilled with butter or plain. Today we had cinnamon chip, we wouldn't get it again. We got it grilled (strongly suggest) but it was still a bit dry. We should have stuck to our normal blueberry muffin. The omelette special for today was pesto chicken.

Man I really enjoy eating here when I'm up in Portland. It's a bummer this place is so small, so sometimes you have to hunker down and wait. 
I really enjoy the grilled muffins. I never seem to get there before raspberry sells out though - so I've only ever tried the blueberry. It's real good. 
I've had both their savory and sweet breakfasts. They cook eggs perfectly IMO. No where ever seems to get the cook right on my eggs - but I made my order - specified that it's a little different from the norm - and BAM perfect eggs. 
I tried the loaded hashbrowns, and while they were good, I think in the future I'll just get the regular hash browns. 
The pancakes are GIANT. The ""silver dollar"" pancakes take up an entire side plate. Be prepared. 
Only main bummer is the last time I was there I was overcharged (charged for two muffins when I only ordered and got one) but didn't notice until later. Will that stop me from returning? No way.

Since I was in South Portland at a convention and visiting family, my mom and I decided that it was high time we tried Marcy's Diner. We showed up this past Sunday morning around 8:30 am and were greeted when we walked in by a cool yet polite guy and groovy music like Stevie Wonder and other upbeat tunes of yore. The cool dude promptly seated us at the counter and the dedicated, energetic waitstaff got our beverage order in moments. For food, my mom got the Crustless Quiche (Ham, Broccoli, and Cheese, I believe) and a colorful side salad, since she's trying to be as ketogenic as possible. I ordered D from the ""Favorites"" menu which included eggs, NY Strip Steak, toast (I opted for an English muffin), and hash browns. Oh my goodness...it was all so good. The steak (ordered Medium Rare) was just the right amount of pink and so juicy! The hash browns were a little like mashed potatoes but they were seasoned just right and the sunny-side up eggs were just runny enough that I could soak them up with my English muffin and hash browns. It was so substantial and stuck to my ribs so well that I barely wanted lunch or dinner later on! 
The only thing I will say as a word of caution is that it's probably best to go solo or just with one other person, since groups of 3 or more had a little bit more of a wait, but between the wait staff that could put the Energizer bunny to shame and the nice greeter/cashier guy, everything was running smoothly like a well-oiled machine.
What I liked the most definitely was how much the staff seemed to support one another and had an enviable amount of synergy. The dishwasher seemed like a new hire and was a little nervous, but the cool guy and the other waitstaff had his back and were giving him tips and encouragement every step of the way. I wish I had that much moral support at any job I've had! The waitress we had most of the time was so funny and had us laughing even at that early hour and took the time to get us a Marcy's Diner shirt (we usually don't get souvenirs but the bacon and eggs in skull and crossbones formation was just a hoot), never once making us feel like a bother. 
Darla was a delight even though I didn't get to say anything to her since she was busy cranking out breakfast. She was just cooking away merrily, grooving to music in her pom pom hat and Hawaiian shirt, and looked like she was having the time of her life.

I was very impressed by this place.  I had high expectations, assuming this place would piggy back off the Screaming Kid Summer 2015 national publicity (yes, it was big talk even in Kentucky this summer) to skimp on food and service as a result.  But I was wrong; this place was fantastic in all ways possible.

First the atmosphere: it's your classic verbal-abuse diner.  It reminds me of going to Grandma's after a Democratic victory in the Elections: good cookin' but Grandma is pissed.  But seriously, the service is great.  They all have the typical frank but semi-friendly attitude with an accent (aka The Maine Special).  Parking isn't bad at 7:30AM; but good luck finding street parking later (I assume). I've seen this place packed out the Wahzoo (which probably explains why Marcy's successor is pissed 24/7 lol jk), so go early to beat the giant crowds that will eventually engulf this place later in the day!

The food was AMAZING!  I had the Corned Beef Hash Benny which was served on super-buttery Texas Toast and with a side of fluffy and buttery hash browns.  I was in Paula Dean Heaven (minus the scandals). And the prices were grand!  $23.74 for a large breakfast for 2 + 1 coffee.  And they sell their hot sauces!  $5 a bottle, and you get to see them go into the secret underground tunnel of hot sauces (this actually exists!).  I highly recommend the green Gringo Bandito sauce.

Bottom line:  Go here, get yelled at, eat lots of food, try some new hot sauce, and buy some sauces to go (because its still cheaper than going to 90% of other places in Portland).

The place is cozy and awesome! The decor is cool and they play music from the 70's, 80's and 90's, so you'll most likely be jamming while waiting and/or eating (the radio station is 100.9). The wait time really wasn't crazy. Our first time, the super cool host gave us about a 20 minute wait and it felt like we got seated a lot faster. The second day, he gave us a 25 minute wait and it was just about right. Third day, Sunday, we got there around 8:15 AM and there was no wait. The waitresses are very attentive, polite, high energy and very cool to chat with. This place is hoppin'! One of my favorite things about Marcy's diner is that they have these bowls filled with Cabot butter and Hood half and half on each table. I love extra butter and love my coffee VERY light, so it was very convenient.

Darla (owner) is a firecracker and you can tell that she is passionate about her food and her business. She is in there cooking, greeting and keeps open communication with the staff. She even took a picture with us!

The food: there was nothing average about the food. AT ALL. It was off-the-hook! The first day we ordered a grilled raspberry muffin to share. It was toasty and soft in all the right places. It wasn't too sweet or bland. For our meals the first day, we had scrambled eggs with hash browns. The eggs were fluffy and perfect. The hash browns had a crispy top and very soft inside. Again, perfect. The Texas toast that comes on the side is delicious.

The second day, we ordered our own grilled muffins. This time I got blueberry and my fiancée got raspberry again. For our meals, he got the daily special which was the angel cake French toast topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and I got an Italian omelette with onions and Texas toast. We were more than satisfied with our meals. Everything tasted fresh and nothing was over or under cooked.

I tried the Spanish omelette on Sunday and in pictures it doesn't look too appealing, but it was delicious. We ordered 4 muffins for the road, 2 blueberry and 2 raspberry. Also, the iced coffee is damn good!

Overall the service was consistently awesome, as was the food. We are DEFINITELY coming back to Marcy's Diner.",4.5,1,"['47 Oak St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6550091209133,-70.26129159023479,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), Diners, "

For toast they offer Texas toast cooked on the grill, which is excellent, but the eggs were mediocre and the hashbrowns were undercooked and had a VERY strong flavor of pork (none of my other grilled food had this flavor, so I think there was pork fat or something like that added to the hashbrowns as opposed to simply the effects of being cooked next to bacon on the grill). I don't normally eat pork and the flavor was strong enough that I had to give the hashbrowns to my husband.
I also had a grilled blueberry muffin. The muffin itself was good - very large and with a nice crumbly topping, but the fact that it was so large meant that not much of the muffin's surface area got grilled. I've had grilled muffins elsewhere that I liked more.

2 stars for food overall, except the grilled raspberry muffin, which is def a 5 star! 

I had heard about Marcy's for a long time and wanted to try it out, especially after it made news over the infant tantrum vs owner spectacle that went down a few months ago. 

First of all, service we got was excellent. No shrieking baby helps, I'm sure. They were friendly, warm and fun. Although our 1 hour wait on a Saturday at 11 was no fun at all. 

Our server had recommended her personal favorite: the raspberry muffin grilled, and that was highlight of our breakfast. 

Marcy's has pretty typical greasy diner food, but I was sorely sorely disappointed with the cinnamon swirl pancake of the day that we ordered. There was hardly any cinnamon flavor and the whole pancake itself tasted like bacon grease. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my bacon bits. Just not when I'm expecting a sweet, cinammony pancake! (for that, I have to say that Bayside cafe has it down!) 

The breakfast burrito I also ordered was alright. It wasn't a standout, just tasted...fine. Lots of cheese and grease with the eggs.

Response:
I have never been to a restaurant that charges for chips and salsa, including many that make their own salsa from scratch. Tomatoes are cheap. 
For dinner, we each had an order of fish tacos or brisket tacos. Speaking from experience with many restaurants serving tacos, businesses typically serve 3 or more tacos with an entrèe. This place serves you 2 small tacos for the same price. All 4 of us in our party felt dissatisfied with what was served. I would not eat here again unless plate sizes were revised to be fair.

Like all Mexican restaurants, we started with the tortilla chips and the salsa-- usually complimentary, here it is $4. The salsa... the consistency was thick like PASTA & it tasted bitter too!! I got goosebumps from my first bite...  and not in the good way! After a few more bites to try to figure what was going on, we called it quits and just ate the remainder of our chips.

We ordered the next Texas thing you can get. The Barbecue Board. Yes, this was the most expensive item on the menu. It came with Chicken & Pork Shoulder, Grits & Mushrooms (this could have been MUCH better), Cornbread (they actually did a good job on this), and we ordered a side of tortillas...which btw they only give you two. The chicken & the pork shoulder were moist and burnt perfectly. However, we got bored of this real fast. 

They offered Habanero Sauce, Barbeque Sauce, and a Vinegar Chili Sauce as well. But, even the sauces disappointed. The Habanero literally tasted like spicy, orange water. No flavor. Nothing exceptional. The Barbeque Sauce was tooo sweet, and the Vinegar Chili was just okay. 

We ordered the $5 Happy Hour Margaritas as well. These weren't too bad. Except, for the Chili rim, I would suggest mixing the salt AND the chili for flavor.",4.5,2,"['52 Washington Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6649178,-70.25208620000001,"Bars, Barbeque, Latin American, "

Inside is small only about 8 tables and a bar. Staff is friendly. They have beer on tap, cocktails and even a few drinks with no alcohol.

Food wise- tortilla soup was on point and delicious. It does have a little bit on a kick. I've been struggling with a cold and coughing and it sent me into a coughing fit. Normally the heat level would have been fine, but I couldn't hack it, pun intended.  I then got fish tacos which were very good. The haddock had the most amazing crunch topped with slaw, crema and siracha. The only thing that would have made it better was avocado. My husband got brisket, it came with 3 slices and he liked it.

I'm a recent transplant to Portland from San Francisco, and Terlingua has very quickly become my go-to dinner spot. Located right on restaurant row, it's just down the street from where I live - lucky me! My two favorites are the margaritas on tap, and the fish tacos. These aren't just any old fish tacos...these are eyes-roll-back-in-your-head fish tacos. Easily the very best I've ever had in my life. So crispy and flavorful. They are also known for their BBQ which is always a hit with my husband.

Terlingua is a cozy little spot with limited seating, so expect a wait if you're coming on a weekend night.

I have walked by numerous times, and I have always been struck by the amazing smell of the food. In the summer, they also have some outside seating set up, and I have always checked out the food that people were eating, and it looked great! 

I finally got a chance to try Terlingua for myself on a Tuesday evening with a party of 10 people. Being that we didn't make a reservation, we walked in hoping that we could be seated, even though it was busy. The restaurant is generally smaller with limited seating, however, they were extremely accommodating and made a place for us to sit in the restaurant. 

We were quickly greeted by our waitress, Kayla, who was really personable and nice, and she took our drink order. I ended up getting the sangria, which was really good and it was only $6! They had other cocktail options which were each around the $8-$10 range, and they had some beer and wine options. 

For my meal, I ended up getting the Street Tacos ($9) which were made with brisket, and I ordered slaw ($2) and the slow-cooked greens with pork belly ($3). Their meals are served really nicely on boards and pieces of slate, which appeals to their general aesthetic. The tacos were small, but when I think of their price, it makes sense that you get two small-er tacos. The flavors of the tacos were really, really good. The brisket was smokey and fell-apart-tender. The slaw was more pickled than a typical slaw, but it was good, and the greens were amazing! They also have some spicy vinegar at each table, which I also put on everything! It was so, so good!

Overall, Terlingua is doing what it does well. I wish their portions were just a bit bigger, but their prices are decent. Unfortunately, I left the restaurant still feeling a bit hungry, so that's why I gave four stars.

Terlingua is a super cute Latin American place in the East End. The inside is rather small but has a good amount of tables and bar space for seating.

As a party of 10, our server was pretty great. She did an awesome job of checking in on us and assisting anyone when needed.

I started off with the house margarita. Honestly, there was nothing exciting about this. Wasn't the best but also wasn't horrible. 

For food, I ordered the brisket street tacos, the jalapeño cornbread, and the beans.
The street tacos came with two small tacos. I have to say that these were DELICIOUS. I probably could have eaten at least 10. The cornbread was also fantastic.
Unfortunately they forgot about my beans at first but were quick to get them to me once realized. Once received and consumed, these too were absolutely delicious.

My only con about this place is their portion sizes. The portions are pretty small and given how good everything tastes you will definitely be wanting more. However, I will also say that the prices are very reasonable so you can order more than one thing... I just wish I knew this in advance.

The platter changes depending on the day. My wife had a yellow tail ceviche tostada, a lunch special. All ingredients fresh & portions ample for lunch & for the cost.

The restaurant is very small. Maybe 10 tables tops. It has a big emphasis on the bar. It's really much more of a hipster spot and NOT a southern barbecue joint. The menu of a regular bbq place would feature its meats (ie., chicken, pulled pork, brisket, sausage,& ribs) in a ""by the lb"" price and have a selection of combos. There's almost none of that here. My rib platter had 4 small ribs. Granted it was only $12.

The real tell came as my wife was still hungry after her lunch so she ordered a cup of red chili. She said to the waiter ""can I have cornbread w it?"". He said that normally if did not come w cornbread but ""I'll take care of you"". It was very nice of him. She was happy. BUT no cornbread with chili? 

Which brings me to my overall observation: this restaurant is a hipster joint that serves good bbq albeit in a very ""precious"" way. There's nothing precious about cornbread or bbq, for that matter. Time with friends and family is precious. Food is not. Make more cornbread.

They deserve 4 stars for the food. It was tasty. The waiter/bartender was slightly inattentive. He never asked us what we'd like to drink so we just stuck with water.

They saw an available table outside and went to tell the rest of us to come over. The bartender literally ran after them--grabbed the drinks out of their hands and dramatically threw them in the street like they were children. We went back into the restaurant to request a refund for the drinks that were thrown out. That's all. They gave us an refund-eventually. Appreciate that...would never go back. Thanks for the refund.

Response: Just a heads up--you have picnic tables outside your restaurant. No one was taking your drinks to another bar.  Just still trying to wrap my head around the fact that the first response was to run after someone while yelling and then throw their drinks on the ground. Seems a bit overkill, no?  A simple ""hey girl, you have to drink that inside the building"" didn't cross your mind? So much drama! I guess if you want dinner and a show-go here. I'm sure the food is decent.

I can't give an extended review here because I've only been in briefly (and unfortunately it was at that awkward time between lunch and dinner when there's a limited menu). Mom and I shared the deviled eggs as an app, and both had the green chile as an entree. Portland doesn't have much in the Latin American genre for dining, so I had been checking out the food-porn on Yelp here for a while. As expected, food was good. 

*Oh, and I like when appetizers come in odd numbers because it allows one person, at each dining experience, to practice being the bigger person. Literally, or figuratively you might ask? You be the judge...

It was a quiet afternoon, and there were maybe only 2 other people here when we stopped in. The ambiance was a little quiet and awkward, and also it seemed kind of weird with the server. I felt like maybe our timing was an inconvenience, plus sometimes my mom acts like she just got to America even though she's been here for over 30 years. Thus, I'll have to go back sometime, and try a dinner. I sense that the vibe, the options, and the overall experience would be much better. Plus, Id prefer to be on a hot date, and not with my mother - because that changes everything. I do have to give props to her, though; she's got the ability to make me appreciate even the most fowl, cheap tequila by her mere presence. That's a pretty amazing super power if you ask me #mothers. I digress...

The burnt ends small plate is a flavorful must try. Nice portion for two to sample, with a chili drizzled sauce that was excellent. The deviled eggs were very creamy. I'm not a huge smoked fish guy, but the smoked trout accompanying the eggs was very good. 

They had four fresh ceviche....we tried two, and both were excellent. One had a very hot and cool profile, with very tender octopus and shrimp as the seafood. The chilies here gave this a spank, but it had fresh fruit to cool things off. The other was a fruit based scallop ceviche, with the beautifully fresh scallops being the star. Highly recommend this. 

We also tried the carne assada tacos, with fresh raw slices of radish and fresh slices of jalapeños. It has a cool creme fresh to balance off the heat. Again, this was a good dish. I didn't try the avocado and spices side dish. Looked nice.

Service is polite. 

The day we went, a chalk board outside the restaurant listed the pricing for the smoked meats of the day:

Brisket: $18/$23.
Ribs: $14/23
Lamb: $23/$28
Chicken: $17
Trout: $17

This may seem normal until the portion size is verified. The first number is for a quarter pound or quarter rack and the second for a half pound or half rack. In this case, a pound of brisket ends up at $46, a rack of ribs $46 and a pound of lamb for $56. 

You do the math, pricey and pricey again. Outrageously expensive, even. 
 
Using inflated NY prices, by the pound offerings at far superior BBQ joints (Hometown, Brisket Town, Sweet Cheeks Boston) come no where close to Terlingua's price per pound. Nothing can justify this kind of expenditure for good but not awesome smoked meat. 

The meats sampled: ribs, brisket were certainly smoked, albeit with not much additional rub or flavorings. The ribs were juicy, smoked well and had a nice crust of seasoning that was fairly flavorless. The meat pulled nicely from the bone without coming away in one giant piece. The Brisket was surprisingly juicy and tender, not dry. Also a barely noticeable rub on the exterior.

Two sauces are provided: a vinegary brown and a smoky brown. Both are too similar to discern one from the other except that one reeks of ketchup and the other of apple vinegar while both have the same consistency. 

That being said, nothing can possibly create a modicum of sanity when the price per pound is calculated. The smoked meat is just not that good. I don't care how good it is, nothing is worth $56/lb.

Two varieties of chili are rich, packed with meat and very different from each other. The red chili is borderline fiery and full of brisket. The green chili is cooling and the perfect offset to the chunk of pulled pork that adorns the bowl

The beer and drink menu is sane. Other entrees listed seem interesting but not out of the ordinary.

Terlingua is located in an unassuming facade (only the symbol is on the sign) adjacent to Silly's on Washington Ave. Inside is attractive with reclaimed brass tables from Nosh and a central bar. The restaurant is Latin American BBQ and some of the theme is translated to the decor. It won't wow you, but it's a comfy space.

Our excellent server quickly brought the drink and food menu. I LOVE how the restaurant has half and full portions for most of the entrees. Sometimes I'm not starving and don't want an expensive dinner. Half portions are still plenty filling and the $8-$10 price can't be beat. Even the $13-18 for full portions is very reasonable. 

I ordered the half portion of green chili with brisket (it comes with pulled pork on the menu but they gladly substituted). This was one of the better chilies that I've ever had. A sizable bowl of chili was filled with potato, corn and cheese and topped with slices of tender brisket. It already had decent spice, but adding house made habanero sauce brought me happily to tears. Three generous slices of grilled pita bread helped relieve the heat. 

The girlfriend is a (semi) vegetarian and her options consisted of two salads, a mushroom-based entree and a poblano-based entree. She chose the large ($11) leaf lettuce salad, beautifully presented with avocado, grapefruit, radish and a sesame seed dressing. She raved about it.

Desserts are presented in small mason jars and topped with ice cream. The apple pie was rich and tasty but would have been better warm.

The margarita ($7) was unmemorable, but the Texas Mojito (with Tito's Vodka instead of rum, $10) was perfectly refreshing on a summer night. The beer list is a decent mix of local and afar.

There are also BBQ boards of brisket, pulled pork and ribs that directly compete with Salvage and Elsmere but overall this is a different type of restaurant, and I'm buying the concept. Great food at affordable prices in a chill atmosphere will win me over every time.",4.5,2,"['52 Washington Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6649178,-70.25208620000001,"Bars, Barbeque, Latin American, "

The server was friendly and he was happy to explain much of the menu. Since it was early we were satisfied with a couple of apps, but we'll come back to try more dishes. 

The shrimp ceviche was awesome. The serving was generous but I still wanted more. 
The ribs were also very good. The first ones were very moist and tender, but a couple were on the dry side. A bit more sauce on the side could have helped with that. Overall they were tasty.

We each got a drink, he loved his bloody mary and my margarita was *not* from a mix (thank you!) with a chili-dipped rim. Both great, and $5 each during happy hour. 

Two apps and two happy hour drinks cost about $40 before tip, so a bit steep for a light fare but for $20 more it would have been a complete meal. We'll definitely go back.",4.5,2,"['52 Washington Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6649178,-70.25208620000001,"Bars, Barbeque, Latin American, "

It was a special menu for the night, but after sampling the food we will definitely be back for their regular menu.  Tuesday night's fare included cucumber and strawberry slices with cream cheese, pork rillettes with a guajillo marmalade (yum!), duck two ways, a spring and asparagus salad, a pork shank and s'mores cake.  The pork shank was gigantic but tender and paired with some wonderfully prepared zucchini and squash, along with crispy grits.  

It was all paired with drinks from Maine Mead Works and Oxbow from right across the street. They all were perfectly chosen for the dishes at hand.  There were a great many of people from Oxbow and Maine Mead there as well and we enjoyed talking to them and finding out more about their drinks.

Had brunch this past Sunday with a gf - we walked in and it was packed with the exception of a 4-top, (two 2-tops pushed together) - we were asked to wait for a 2-top about 10-15 minutes which was fine since it was actually nice out that day (shocker this winter), so we went outside to get our vitamin d.  After a while we were sat...only to see the table we could have sat at was sat shortly after for just 2 people! Odd.

Server was a bit fresh, just had a cockiness to him, but whatever - when asked if anything could be switched for the pulled pork in the pulled pork benny he gave an abrupt ""nope!"" - instead of suggesting the kitchen doesn't prefer to do substitutions etc (which I would have totally understood as I have worked on and off in restaurants for years).  The benny sounded amazing but sometimes a girl just doesn't want a pile of shredded pork first thing on her Sunday morning ya know? Anyway I settled on eggs and a biscuit from the a la carte menu which were delicious, and my friend got a pastrami special which she seemed to enjoy.  We had a couple mimosas and were able to chat without being rushed which was very appreciated.

3773,I1aETEsRcnnEftQvLwzzNA,terlingua,3773,2017-05-15,"My wife and I took our 2.5 year old son to Terlingua on Friday night.  We arrived just before 5:00 and the place was not yet crowded.  Since the BBQ isn't ready until 5:00, we settled in with some queso and very good, $5 happy hour sangria.  The queso was quite tasty, but served with few chips. Fortunately, the waitress promptly offered more chips that our son kept digging into.

Halfway through our queso and now past 5:00, we put in an order for the larger portion of pork shoulder, the lamb belly appetizer and a side of asparagus.  I must say, I've been here twice before and thought it was good (but not great), but tonight's meal was amazing.  I'm not even a huge BBQ fan, but the latin spin offers flavors more in my wheelhouse (and thankfully no potato salad in sight).

I tried the pork shoulder first, which was extremely tender with a nice bark.  The BBQ sauce they served was fantastic and we were told at the outset that more would be available upon request.  Our son initially didn't warm up to the pork, but he ended up eating a ton of it at the end of the meal after we thought he was stuffed.  We also went through that 2nd cup of BBQ sauce that's the best I've ever had.  Subtle and flavorful at the same time.

Then the lamb belly....wow.  I don't think it's been on the menu in our previous visits.  Otherwise, it's an epic fail on my part for not ordering it sooner.  I don't recall all the garnishes, but I believe there was some feta on top.  Our son loved it as much as we did.  Absolutely fantastic. 

Asparagus isn't my favorite, but the wife loves it and it was dressed up with bacon and some cheese sauce.  I found that dipping it in our remaining queso was quite nice.  Somewhere in all of this we got another round of sangria.  I remember thinking we've got quite a bit of pork to take home, but then it all disappeared. We couldn't stop eating, but didn't leave feeling over-full.

I'd be remiss if I didn't call out the service as friendly and prompt, although the place was just finally filling up as we left.  It seems that getting there right as the BBQ is coming off the grill is the way to go, if you can eat that early.

The short ribs were really good as well, with tender meat and a strong flavor. The lamb's shoulder was dry and, on the whole, flavorless. I got some flavor out of it by dipping it in the barbecue sauce, which was nothing special in and of itself (mostly sweet, a little tangy, and maybe just a little smokey).

Having two glasses of red wine already under my belt, I was in the mood for food. Needless to say, I ordered two of the beef cheek tacos and a side of corn, stat. I'd heard good things about the beef cheek tacos so I was ready. The atmosphere inside seemed cozy and bustling but we weren't going to be too long so outside was just the right spot.

They've got a good drink selection, and great beers if that's your thing. The flavor combinations in the other items sounded great so I will definitely be back to try more. There were some vegetarian friendly items on the menu which I'll go back for. It's definitely a meat heavy spot but I think a vegetarian could get by here - a vegan I'm not so sure but I'd be very surprised if they couldn't accommodate specific dietary requests given their pricing and great service.

The beef cheek tacos came and rocked my world. The meat was soft and tender, each on a soft corn tortilla. On the side I had some fresh green chili sauce which made them even more flavorful and just brought out the rich flavors in the meat. My side of corn is something I'll probably pass on next time but I was in ""must eat"" mode and assumed it was elote. It was definitely more of a deconstructed elote if close to elote at all at this point. It's more like a spicy version of creamed corn - I only say creamed (it has no cream mind you) because it's cooked with pork pieces and the meat really added an aspect of richness to it - it's also topped with queso fresco (I believe that's what this was) and mixed with some fresh veggie components (cilantro, onions), plus spices. Not terrible for a side but I'll probably pass it up next time.

We started with the daily cerviche. It had shrimp which was so refreshing. Definitely get this as an appetizer the smaller size was perfect for two. I have had this twice and it's so delicious. 

I ordered a sangria which to my surprise was a lot dryer than I usually have but in a good way. It didn't taste too sweet at all. It was a house special with blueberries. Delicious. 

Next my boyfriend and I ordered the green chili with pork and the red chili with brisket. Both were amazing and very filling. Next time I'll get the smaller size. Big bang for your buck here!

3785,I1aETEsRcnnEftQvLwzzNA,terlingua,3785,2015-08-13,"For the life of me, I can't pronounce the name of this place despite them writing it out phonetically on every piece of online and offline collateral they have. It's ""Ter-ling-wah"", however that doesn't want to come out of my mouth. ""Turr-lyn-gooo-wah"", however, does.

When this place first opened, I swear I saw panko avocado tacos on their menu. I SWEAR I DID. It's why this vegetarian wanted to come to the restaurant in the first place despite the fact that they're billed as a BBQ joint. I mean, Portland is one of the world's epicenters for amazing food, but we're missing some quintessential things. Like really amazing panko avocado tacos. So I suggested we come here and much to my chagrin... there are no panko avocado tacos on the menu. What the what?!?!

The space is unsurprisingly small, but seems very spacious given the way they have it currently laid out. Smart on them not to clutter the room with too many tables, oddly shaped tables, or tables in the center of the space. The windows are large and let in a ton of natural light, and the tones of the interior decor are very warm. The house music was there, but barely audible - kind of exactly what you want when you're out!

Our waiter was patient, had a sense of humor (after a friend ordered George Clooney's tequila, we got to hear about the servers personal experience with The Situation's protein filled vodka), and was just personal enough to make us feel welcome and make our experience feel completely authentic. He made suggestions based on what he personally liked, he made suggestions on what he's seen as popular with other customers, and after being told that half of our party were vegetarians he - unprompted - let us know everything on the menu that was vegetarian and what could/couldn't be made vegan. How thoughtful is that?

So, we drank/ate:
+ Sangria ($6): I. Love. Sangria. In my opinion, bad sangria is better than good most everything else. That's a bad segue, because I'm not saying Turrlyngoowah's was bad; it was very, very tasty and hit the spot! And at just a $6 price point? Girl's gonna drink at least two or three errehtime, because it rocks to have a place offering drinks at under $10 a piece when Portland's cocktail prices seem to be irrationally inflated.
+/- Sliced avocado and tomato with salted cucumber ($6): If you're a lover of the marriage between avocados and tomatoes, then of course you're going to appreciate this light, refreshing option. However... it's not anything I couldn't make at home, so I'm not sure I would go out of my way to order it again.
+ Roasted cauliflower with poblano and cheese ($6): YES. All day long. As others have mentioned, it tastes like one of the most creamy, sinful mac & cheese's in the world. Also - you get a pretty good-sized crock-full for just $6. THAT'S AWESOME. Please don't change a thing about this! I could easily come back for this and a glass of a sangria and be perfectly happy.
- Stuffed Poblanos ($16), poblanos stuffed with smoked walnuts, currants, rice, and topped with red chile sauce: Do NOT get this if you don't love spice. I like spice, but this was far to hot for me to handle. Even the stuffing - which seemed to be mostly rice (I didn't see or taste any walnuts, and only a smattering of currants), was infused with heat. Yowza!
+ Mushroom Empanada ($18), mushrooms and winter hill farm cheese with a fried egg and a salad of mixed greens: I really liked this a lot. Like A LOT, A LOT. I thought it was going to be more mushroomy and cheesy, but it seemed more spinachy on the inside. Not that that's a bad thing. Also, while the dough was baked to flaky, golden perfection I was originally concerned about how dry it was. That's when I realized... that's what the egg is for. To dip your empanada crust in the runny yolk. SO CREATIVE. SO GOOD. Do I think it's worth $18? Absolutely not, especially given the Stuffed Poblanos had far more food for a lower price point.
+/- Tres Leches Cake ($?): It was good - just the right amount of sweet. Definitely for sharing, though. Unfortunately mine seemed particularly soupy. It just sort of dribbled everywhere every time I took a bite.

We have been here before but found the food a little too smokey but wanted to give it another try.  We arrived at around 5:30 and ordered apps, Margaritas and dinner.  The food again was spot on.  The check came and with tip was over $300.00. By then it was 7pm.  We thought it was early so we ordered another round of drinks.  At around 7:15 We ordered yet a third round.  When the waitress came back with the drinks she rudely informed us that we were receiving our last drink order because they needed the table. What? Nobody was waiting for a table.  There were three other large tables empty and overall we dropped over $400.00. If this restaurant represents Portland, then we have big problem. Unfortunately, since there are so many options in the area we will be taking our business elsewhere in the future.
An update as of the next day:  After going back and forth with the owner, we aired our concerns and were rewarded with the response of an outstanding businessman.  Pliny R. explained the restaurant's side as did I and we concluded there were some issues (on both sides) that were resolved.  We will again go back to this restaurant in the future.

I cooked at a BBQ restaurant in Bucks county PA, so my expectations were somewhat high. I followed this place on Instagram and drooled over all of their meat pictures! Finally tried it, and it lived up to my expectations. The menu was very small but everything we tried was delicious! I tried the regular item deviled eggs which had smoked mussels on it for a special, burnt ends of brisket and the pork shoulder. The coleslaw and cornbread accompaniments were also delicious.

First off I'll say that I really liked it here. The space is fairly small but they've made use of it wisely. There are seats at the bar and plenty of tables plus some great outdoor picnic tables for the hot summer nights. The tables are covered in copper and reminded me strongly of the tables at Nosh. The silverware is wrapped up in a tea towel and placed in the water glass. Just a unique little touch to make them stand out from other restaurants.

We started off the meal with the small version of the pork belly chicharron. It came with some dressed greens. It was super tasty with a crispy outside and that wonderful creamy pork belly inside. I wish the portion had been a little larger for the price.

My main course was the large order of chicken pozole with a side of roasted cauliflower. The pozole was wonderful and very flavorful. It had shredded chicken and hominy in a warm broth with sliced avocado on top. It came with a generous portion of grilled bread that we found out was from the Tandoor bakery in town. I'm not sure if it was intentional but my pozole was slightly lukewarm. I'm kinda glad for that because I didn't need scalding hot soup on a warm day in June. 

My roasted cauliflower was other worldly. It was crunchy and cheesy all at the same time. It looked like baked mac and cheese when it came out and in dim lighting could be mistaken for just that. I couldn't resist eating almost all of it. It was a good portion for a side dish.

I'm still trying to figure out the mood they are going for. The decor is very homey and has a bit of Latin flair but the music was all EDM with a heavy emphasis on deadmau5. Those two things didn't really jibe for me.

Overall, I really liked it and I'll definitely be back because I want to try the bar snacks served from 9pm to close and some of the desserts!",4.5,2,"['52 Washington Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6649178,-70.25208620000001,"Bars, Barbeque, Latin American, "

3793,I1aETEsRcnnEftQvLwzzNA,terlingua,3793,2016-07-28,"This review pertains mostly to the non-BBQ food items. When we left we just didn't feel right about the amount of money we had spent and the ultimate satisfaction or value of the food. 

Terlingua treated us well and there wasn't anything overtly wrong or bad, but with every dish we had there was something missing to give it that extra oomf that would have made it worth the price. 

Summer tomato salad: $9 for five thin slices of tomato with salt. The dish tasted great, there just wasn't much of it. 

Tostada: Missing that extra oomf-- needed some acidity to cut through the meat and cream.

White bean anchovy salad: Beans tasted like they were out of a can and didn't have a defining flavor. More anchovy and garlic would make it pop. 

Chicken tortilla soup: This was a thick soup composed of mainly dark meat and a dense broth. I would have preferred a lighter, classic one in true Mexican style with beans and other vegetables added, some lime flavor, cumin, and other spices, as well as the shaved lettuce/ cotija cheese on top. It felt gloopy and heavy, missing that zing of freshness and flavor.

Beer: Good beer. 

Brisket tacos: 
- The meat was incredible-- they do barbeque right. Very flavorful and juicy brisket. In the taco, the salsa overpowered the flavor of the meat and detracted from it. The ingredients of the taco were all there (grilled scallions, radishes, onion, cilantro) but all together it didn't come together to give an experience worth $15 for three tacos. They should change the tortilla to the softer, true corn ones-- the tortilla was the stiff yellow kind.
- We ordered two tacos, and literally thought we were ordering two tacos, because at almost all restaurants you order tacos in an individual quantity. It turned out we ordered two taco plates at $15 each and the menu only says ""priced daily"" and the server only told us what the meat of the day was. We should have asked for clarification, but it would help to have the fact that it is a taco plate more upfront on the menu. 

At the end of the day, we just felt that we could have gotten much better value Mexican food at a more fair price somewhere else.",4.5,2,"['52 Washington Ave', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6649178,-70.25208620000001,"Bars, Barbeque, Latin American, "

Located in the up and coming East Bayside hood, just on the fringes of Munjoy Hill this little gem is a must visit! It's a small dining room, but very well designed with simple, earthy, industrial decor, outside patio and a fabulous bar. 

The staff is extremely knowledgeable & friendly, which is always a plus...and seem genuinely happy to be there. 

It's great for groups because many of the plates are more tapas style, or for couples who just love to eat. Both instances we fit, so I have a feeling we will be visiting this place often. 

On our first trip in we enjoyed:

Summer Corn Salad - my personal favorite, simple, fresh and delish
Mushroom Empanada - amazeballs
Smoked Beef Tongue & Cheek Tacos - I can't lie, I didn't enjoy this the husband did, but he said it was good. It scared me personally but that's just me!
Smoked Skirt Steak - a little too smoked for me, but still good, just not my personal favorite.
Grilled Corn with Cojita Cheese - can't go wrong with this!
Roasted Cauliflower - oh so delish

We had tried to get into another place earlier in the evening and the wait was too long. Our awesome tour guide-relative-Portland resident tried hard to acquiesce our food desires while also finding a place without a 2 hour wait.

We were seated fairly quickly at the bar for drinks and then within minutes found our table to be ready. Ou bartender was awesome; she even checked on our table to see how the drinks were. I'd ordered an amazing drink (a something sling-I really should have written it down) that lasted about 30 seconds in my glass...it was that tasty. I switched to a cocktail after that was just as good. 

We shared an order of chicken wings with chili-lime rub and Maine Mussels with coconut milk, ginger, lemongrass and lime. The wings were crispy and well seasoned, not greasy. The mussel broth was delicious and was served with three thick and crusty buttered slices of bread. We sopped up as much of that broth as we could until one of us (ahem me) ate the remainder with a spoon once everyone else had their fill. 

I wasn't wowed by the main dish options, so I opted for the Braised Local Beets with Miticana Goat Cheese, Celtic Vinegar and Pepitas as well as the Smoked Hake Chowder. The server suggested I layer the beets over the cheese to melt it and she was spot on: the combo was very good. 

The soup came out in such a large and generous helping that was pleasantly surprising. I expected a small bowl and was thrilled it was so copious. I really didn't need anything else to eat.

I've eaten a lot of chowder in my life and this was hands down one of the best I've ever eaten. The smokiness was subtle and there was a hint of sweet to the fish breading. It was perfectly creamy and I loved how all the mirepoix was minced finely so it blended into the soup like a dream.

I settled on trying their house tonic, which is made in-house and seasonal, mixed with rye and lime (at the bartenders recommendation). It was delicious.

For food, I opted for a lighter fare and got the crunchy Asian slaw salad, and topped it with the grilled chicken tikka. We also got an order of fries to start. 

The fries came out and were cooked to a nice golden crisp, with just a touch of salt. The salad soon followed and it was refreshing and satisfying, with a portion that filled your stomach but didn't make you feel like you overate.

We started with the chicken wings. They were so tasty, I never wanted them to end. We didn't use the dipping sauce, it tasted a bit spicy to me. With the side of Brussels for $5, you can't go wrong. They are fabulous. The Caesar salad was very full of flavor as well. They put their own mix on it with a half piece of bread and a soft boiled egg in the middle. You cut it up and choose the bites you want. The ""famous"" burger did not fall short on flavor. We also added bacon jam to ours for $2. Personally, the smoked flavor isn't for me, so eating through that was hard at times. The bun from Rose Foods is a perfect touch to this burger. As for the fries, my favorite part--none of them were soggy. I guess after being cooked 3 times, how can they be? 

We opted out of dessert even though the options sounded fabulous. They make a few flavors of ice cream in-house.

We ordered the pork belly burger, thrice cooked fries, and the fried Brussels sprouts. Everything tasted so good. The pork belly was tender and delicious and the sauce on the burger was amazing, but it wasn't slathered in sauce like most places would do. The fries were extra crispy on the outside but still had that softness on the inside that I love. And the Brussels sprouts were to die for. I honestly think they could convert any sprout hater. They had a little bit of a charred texture instead of the typical soggy sprouts and it had a slight lemony flavor. I could go for just the sprouts, they were THAT good.

Very good service, and nicely done cocktails. Kind of a mixed bag on the food... The fries were nice and crisp, my wife's chicken sandwich was excellent, however, my burger was a disappointment. It looked better than it actually was... The beef was under-seasoned...tasted quite bland.

We decided to order a pretzel to start which was a little small but a nice way to start the meal. The mustard was made in house and had a different taste I couldn't quite put my finger on but still delicious. 

Funny to see how chicken is the most expensive thing on the menu, usually that's not the case. Either way I decided to get it to see if it was worth it. My boyfriend got the pasta. The pasta was okay. I liked the sauce it was in but the pasta seemed kinda of chewy, not al dente.  The chicken breast was good a little too charred which skewed the taste. The sauce it came with was good though. It also had broccoli and grits as well. The grits was good a little too sweet or creamy for me. 

For dessert my boyfriend got a black coffee which came out cold unfortunately and some dessert. I'm not a fan of creme fraiche so it wasn't for me but he seemed to enjoy it.

3947,KZ1Tkyso2j4iN98NQ6kJBQ,east-ender,3947,2018-05-22,"Started w/ pork belly rillettes and split the ceasar salad. Both were really good. The ceasar was really 4+. I perfer a little more raw garlic and salt/anchovy, but good. The eggs on top was poached perfectly and topped w real quality parm would immediately order again.
For the entrees, friend ordered the green curry lemongrass mussels and I went w the smoked burger w mushrooms. She liked the mussels (I'll defer to her not really my thing). 
The burger was definitely tasty and the cold smoke feature to the process totally impacted the meat really well, but not overpowering ways. Two hairsplitting nitpicks, the bun not really butter toasted, warm or soft on the inside and the burger temp ordered med-rare really was well-done. However, it wasn't overly dry, but there was no pink... So perhaps this is due to the cold smoke  process? Personally I have only cold smoked slabs of pork belly.  So I am unaware of what that process would do to a patty of ground sirlion etc. My guess now is that it would change the color of the meat, but not the meat temp? So perhaps achieving a seared, but juicy pink center is just not possible? Anyway... 
Best parts... Service a 5. No names known, but host was friendly, server knew the menu and was also incredibly patient w a needy table of jackasses behind us.
Drinks a 5. Bissell and lunch on tap. Like that stuff. And the sip I had of a specialty ginger drink (@ the top of menu) was really nice and summertime appropriate. 
AND.. the only reason I wanted to write this review..... Is b/c of the French fries. They are heaven. SUPER crisp. No skin (probably b/c of the 3 x cooking) and just pillowy warm insides.

I ended up at East Ender because I had difficulty finding an establishment in Old Port that would allow take-out.  Maybe I could've tried harder, but after a day of walking around in the heat, and hear four nos, I really just wanted dinner and a bed.  I didn't think it would be so difficult finding fish and chips, fish sandwich, fish anything.  I was in... MAINE!

I called East Ender because it was next to another restaurant I was eyeing.  The very pleasant young woman on the phone had to check with the kitchen to see if take-out was allowed.  My wish was granted, but I think I pissed them off by requesting take-out.

I may be from New York, but even in New York, fish and chips are golden crusted and good, in most places.  That's all I wanted.  My standards weren't that high even though I was in... MAINE!  I got back to my hotel room, and I just couldn't believe it.  The fish (Haddock, I believe) was burnt and so were the fries.  There was something that looked and tasted like squash in the container, too.  Well, huh, I didn't even finish it, and I wish I had taken a picture of the sorry non-edibles before me.  I didn't think about taking a photo until someone asked me about the ""amazing food"" in Portland, and I couldn't get off of my burnt fish and chips from... MAINE!

i like my mac and cheese kind of burnt (around the edges, you know).  I like my meat a little charred.  The corners of my baked salmon?  Sure!  Crispy french fries... depends on the cut.  I would never down an entire restaurant over one dish, but any restaurant who has the audacity to send out burnt, blacked food is not a restaurant deserving of patronage.  I find that to be just disrespectful.

I plan on going back to Maine, and while everyone else is on their lobster roll crawl, I will be on the hunt for some golden, flaky fish and chips.

TL;DR: Exquisite all around; definitely get a mixed drink and dessert!

My mother and I were looking for a nice place to celebrate that wasn't too expensive. We have different eating styles. (I'm inquisitive, she's rather reserved.) Though there weren't a plethora of food options, the menu varied plenty to cover most palates.

The appetizer we shared, the grilled escarole, was fantastic. The vegetables were grilled perfectly; the dressing, plated beneath the vegetables, was amazing; the toast was wonderfully flavored. And the plating was beautiful. I was particularly impressed with the perfectly poached egg - no residual water whatsoever.

My mother's main course was the lobster club whereas I ordered the gnocchi. Her sandwich was very flavorful, the strong flavors blending exceptionally. My gnocchi was more relaxed but just as flavorful, wonderfully crafted. (And the sauce was absolutely superb!) The portion sizes were decent, but as wonderful as it had been, we had to try dessert.

The panna cotta was the best I have ever had. Perfect texture, brilliant flavoring, and a wonderful blend of the flavors as well. It was also unexpectedly large, making it great for sharing. Absolutely heavenly!

The beverage list also deserves a highlight. They have a full bar with specialty cocktails that looked wonderful, but the mocktails drew our attention. My mother got the Old Ship Fizz - flavors I would not have thought to combine but which made for a magical concoction. The lemon soda-based one I had was potently delicious, offering a punch of pucker.

Finally, I must praise the excellent waitservice.

If you avoid the fryer, you can have a nice meal at East Ender.  The non-deep-fried choices in our party were all hits.  The marinated olives and the mussels were delicious.  The burgers, lobster melt and cavatelli earned thumbs ups.   

But O that fryer! If you didn't think it possible for a Maine restaurant to mess up fish 'n' chips, welcome to Portland.  The fish appeared quadruple-fried, encased in a barely edible sarcophagus as thick and hard as that of a week-old corn dog. Which is too bad because the fish, once collected from the shell, was flaky and fresh. The thrice cooked fries, which are the same as those imposed upon the burgers, were deep fried to total crispiness.  One might reasonably consider them burned. They are also very over-salted.

We didn't climb the stairs to explore, but noticed others did.  We were greeted by Chloe, who was also our server, and invited to choose between two tables for two.  We chose the one in the window.  We were given menus.  I ordered a glass of Malbec.  Chloe gave Alan a taste of the dark beer they had on tap so he could decide if he liked it.  He did, so he ordered some.  I forget its name.

We had both decided on fish and chips when Chloe came over and told us the evening's specials.  The main was short ribs w/ carrots, locally foraged ramps and fiddlehead ferns.  Fiddlehead ferns!!!  I love them.  I was introduced to them at a Downeast restaurant several years ago.  I was excited at the prospect of having them again.  Of course I abandoned the fish and chips for the short ribs and fiddlehead ferns.  We decided to share a bowl of smoked hake chowder.  Alan stuck w/ the fish and chips, which came w. roasted spaghetti squash.  We also ordered a side of the fried Brussels sprouts.

The chowder was delicious, w/ a lovely smokey flavor from the hake.  It was light and had small dice of potatoes that were wonderful, so small they didn't dominate.   They were not overcooked, so they weren't mushy.  They had a toothsome bite that was a pleasure.  The short ribs came w/ a largish cube of potatoes.  It was unlike anything I'd seen before.  It was seasoned nicely and fried so it had a sturdy crust.  I don't generally eat potatoes but this was so deliciously unusual I ate every bit.  Fortunately it wasn't huge.  The short ribs were tender and w/ no visible fat.  The carrots were al dente, just the way I like them.  Only the fiddlehead ferns were a little disappointing, lacking in flavor.  They could have used some of the seasoning from the Brussels sprouts, which were excellent.  Alan's fish was one very large piece, moist and delicious.  The chips were thrice fried.  The spaghetti squash was very tasty too.  I liked the tastes I had of his dish and he liked the taste he had of mine.  We were both happy w/ our meals and neither of us had room for dessert.  Service was excellent.  There were 3 or 4 other tables occupied.

I ate the Charlie Nobel on a port roll containing roasted turkey, provolone, and brussel sprout slaw. The sandwich is huge, with generous amounts of juicy roasted turkey. Mild melty provolone coated the turkey, and the crunchy, tart, brussel sprout slaw. I also enjoyed the roll. It reminded me of a baguette, because it had a similar, sweet taste with a crispy crust, but a softer, airy texture inside.

Overall, the sandwich was yummy, and a good value for a large sandwich at $10.00. I recommend grabbing a sandwich to go or enjoy the causal booth seating inside.

With most poutine, the fries end up getting less crispy and more soggy than when the plate first comes out. Using tater tots lends to a crisp exterior through and through, which makes your poutine experience much more enjoyable.

This rich and satisfying dog was topped with a succulent lamb chili,salsa verde and a delightful pile of cheese curd. Yumalicious!

...and Blue Rooster has tots. 

Considering where this is located, it's a good place to get a snack or soak up alcohol.  I didn't see many healthy options, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. My friend informed me in the beginning of the night that she wanted poutine. While I am not against poutine, I'm just not into cheese curds. Plus, no human being ever raised their self esteem by eating a bowl of fried potatoes covered in cheese and gravy. And did I mention there was also pork AND bacon on the tots we ordered? Let's be real, adding bacon to any meal is like adding a lap dance to your mouth.  

My friend's boyfriend got a hot dog of some sort.  To be frank (badum-chhhhhh), I'm guessing it was good because he literally ate it in 60 seconds. They have some unique toppings, and that seems kinda cool.You could have an all American lap dance of ketchup and mustard....or an oriental lap dance (think fried egg and kimchee).

Crispy potato goodness covered in whatever you like or buck naked. Tot-tine with cheese curds and gravy is my new best friend (sorry real friends!). The gravy is perfect and the cheese curds are the real deal. I recommend inhaling it like I do or the tots can get a little soggy from the gravy. The three little pigs is also another of my favorites. It's the Tot-tine topped with bacon, sausage and pork belly. Heart attack city? You bet. Guilty pleasure? 100%. If you are a tot purist, you can get them plain and just enjoy the crispy goodness. Have I said enough about the tots? Oh probably. 

To keep the goodness going, try a sandwich or a hot dog. You can get a hot dog wrapped in bacon! Yes! What an amazing idea. The toppings are varied and different from your average hot dog vendor. You can go messy or simple, it doesn't matter because they are all good. The sandwiches are unique and you'll look at the board and wonder ""hmm...I wonder how those flavors will go together."" Be adventurous. You won't be disappointed. I recently  have the chicken PBLT which is chicken thigh, confit pork belly, lettuce, pickled green tomatoes and chipotle mayo. It was wonderful. I'm pretty sure it was on a ciabatta roll and there was just the right amount of mayo.

I'm always on the hunt for local eats open late so I can proudly tell outta statahs who whine that ""there's nothing open"" what's what. I would definitely send them to Blue Rooster should they be craving a delicious snack post-bars closing! For that matter, I'd send them there if they needed a little lunch fix during their Old Port excursion! It's a very small, but clean and inviting space that's ideally located and offers prime people watching. The staff is also VERY friendly and the menu is creative, interesting, reasonably rice, and delicious... if you're not a vegetarian that is.

We came for lunch on a Monday afternoon and ordered the chickpea sandwich, potato salad, and fried Brussels sprouts (three of the five things we, as herbivores, could eat there). There was some confusion between me and the man taking my order though, and instead of getting The Farmer Ted (the hummus, goat cheese, and veg sandwich) we got the chickpea salad instead. Not the end of the world, but the miscommunication was frustrating when we didn't get what we thought we had ordered.

The potato salad was good, but underseasoned. It was very nice, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't flavorful or memorable.

The chickpea salad was a blend of Mediterranean flavors - whole chickpeas, red peppers, olives, fennel, thyme - that worked really well together. It was good, but (if you're someone who cooks frequently) it wasn't worth the price tag when you could make something similar at home.

And then, there were the fried Brussels sprouts. Listen, if you're coming to Blue Rooster Food Co. for the first time and you don't order the Brussels sprouts, well then, SHAME ON YOU. These sprouts, covered in a sweet chili sauce and topped with sesame seeds and queso fresco, are alone worth coming for. They are definitely the stand-out item here, and are a unique food item in the city that Blue Rooster alone is making. They are a textural and flavor wonderland, though I wish there'd be more queso fresco on them (this is totally a personal thing though - everything, in my opinion, could have more cheese on it!).

Would I come back here? Maybe. But, because of it's lackluster veg-options (and I totally understand that I'm not their target audience; as a matter of fact, I appreciate the offerings they DO have...

The food came out in about 10 minutes. My tots were hot and the bun was warm. I was expecting a heavy buttery lobster roll but in turn received a refreshing twist on the sandwich. The slaw mixture over pewees the taste of the lobster. Think it was to many layers  of  flavor for the rather tiny lobster  roll. They also have tater tots in  many different forms. The house ketchup taste  is  for a select group of palettes. Not a fan but to each  is  on. I also  tried the tot-tine, which is just like poutine(gravy cheese curds on fries) my friend had most  of this and said  it was decadent and savory. Ate it so fast I almost didn't get  to try it.

A $9 minimum when their average sandwich is under $9, including tax, just rubs me the wrong way. Are they doing this so that I'm nudged to add some tots and a drink to my order to bring it over $9, or are they just really worried about the percentage that the credit card companies are skimming off of their transactions? Either way, it irks me something fierce, and upon doing some light research, it may actually be illegal. Honestly, I'd prefer if they were cash-only. At least that's fair.

All that aside, their food is outstanding. I've had a sandwich, a bacon-wrapped hot dog, and tater tots from them, and they've all be absolutely wonderful.

I got my tots and dog to go, and they asked me if I wanted ketchup and/or hot sauce, and put them in little plastic containers for me in my to-go bag. They even marked the hot sauce with a ""HS"" in sharpie so I didn't mix it up with the ketchup. Upon opening my tots container, I noticed they had put a little wooden prong with which to poke my tots. A really lovely touch. Great attention to detail.

And so, I love Blue Rooster, but I'm also mad at them. ""Change your ways!"" I scream at them while shaking my fist, but in the other fist I tightly grasp one of their bacon-wrapped hot dogs.

Pros: Open later, great tater tots. 

Cons: Parking, small dining area. 

I went on a Sunday afternoon with the girlfriend after a day of roaming the city and we luckily found a parking spot right in front of the place, but there are limited spots around the area so just be mindful when going here. It's probably better off as a place to go to after you've done some exploring around the city. It's a small space to get your food and have a quick bite or a quick, casual lunch. 

We went in and it was empty so it was perfect to explore everything about the place. The menu had sandwiches hot dogs and our fav: tater tots. We opted for the three little pigs tater tots, small brussels sprouts (per recommendation of Yelpers) and the Seoul Dog. 

Tater tots: need I say more? Tots are delicious by themselves and the combo with cheese, and bacon makes it even more delicious. Left me wanting more. 

Brussels Sprouts: I've never liked brussels sprouts but wanted to give them a try since Yelpers raved about them. I still don't like brussels sprouts. They were grilled and had some sauce and cheese on them but I couldn't get over the brussels taste. 

Seoul Hot Dog: I've had better dogs themselves. It wasn't anything spectacular. The kim-chi on it was more vinegar-y than I usually like it. I probably don't try it again, but I will be willing to try another dog.

This place has so much to offer for everyone. I am a vegetarian and yes, there are lots of hot dogs and meat here, but there are so many options for me, which I LOVE. Came here around 1:30 on a Saturday with my pals, and was probably the only sober one in here, which I also love. Love watching drunk people so much, especially in the Old Port. The place was packed, as it always is after the bars let out, and I came in not hungry at all and then all of a sudden I was the hungriest person in the restaurant. I love going out to eat with my vegetarian friends too, makes sharing so easy! We had the sweet chili brussel sprouts, the tahini fried cauliflower, and the buffalo tots. I am literally starving right now typing this and I just ate dinner. I was beyond obsessed with every single bite I took. The portions are big, the prices are super fair, and damn do they just do a stellar job. Is it healthy? No, not really, BUT you are getting your veggies in! While we are all eating, not talking, laughing, etc., we tried to decide what our favorite was. I went back and forth, back and forth. I was really just in love with all of them. I think when it comes down to it though, those buffalo tots really are the bomb. I mean, first off, who doesn't like tater tots? Second, add buffalo sauce, blue cheese, celery, and carrots. COME ON. That is a HUGE win. I was licking the box by the end of it. Oh, I see how that sounds. But then, wow, the fried cauliflower. Yup. Amazing. Scallions, tahini, paprika, okay. I am OBSESSED with tahini, so this was a no brainer to get. And fried cauliflower? One of my favorite things. Did I mention brussel sprouts are also one of my favorite things? Well, I have a lot of favorite things. We didn't know what to do because we wanted both but ultimately decided on the sweet chili- good choice, great choice, excellent choice. I know the caesar ones are awesome too, as I've had those in the past. My other friend had a falafel, which I tried, and loved as well. Overall, 5+++ stars for Blue Rooster.

The good: wow-me-gently flavor on the creamy mac (but then, I never eat anything so rich at home) paired with the gentle crunch of the breadcrumbs.

The better(?): the gobble-able spice and sourness level on the giant portion of kimchi. I could have eaten the full quarter-pound or so of cabbage I was served if I weren't already full of mac. 

The best: My stomach now sounds like a bluegrass concert. Apparently, the combination of ferment plus dairy = twine time.

The details: The staff members were super nice. Everything is house-made, so it takes a minute more than your average counter service. I wish it were a buck or two cheaper (as far as the kimchi, they could get away with charging $2.50 and halving the portion!) but that's probably because I don't get out much.

4293,IFVqt80ROGRWq884m7rWCg,bramhall,4293,2019-04-23,"On Friday night (April 19th), a patron at this bar tried to attack me. 

I'm posting this as a warning to any woman considering coming to this bar-- please look out for yourself, as no one there will care or make any attempt to help you, even in the event of evident aggressive and hostile actions.

I have been failed THREE TIMES now by your management-- one time the night-of, when both bartenders and the doorman looked away as this man shouted, poked and shoved me and grabbed my arms to keep me from getting away. I instead quietly and calmly paid my bill and walked out as he physically chased me and tried to restrain me. I couldn't ask for help over him trying corral me, I was just trying to get out. Any one of the three employees could've easily asked him at an absolute minimum to hold up for a minute, giving me time to escape unharmed. But they did not. 

The second two failures came when I mustered up the courage two days later to call and ask to talk to a manager, not to complain or ask for anything, but to chat about how to help other women who may find themselves in my situation going forward. The first time I called (Sunday, April 21, 4:00pm), the guy on the phone told me the manager wasn't around but he'd pass on my number and have him call me ""some time this week."" He expressed no concern and hung up on me as I was asking if there was another way I could get in contact with him.

I called again on Monday (April 22, 6:00pm), after still hearing nothing. A new guy on the phone was a bit more sympathetic, and said the manager still wasn't in but he would call him now to let him know and ask him to call me that evening. He said he hadn't heard about the incident and asked for my phone number again. So I guess my first call fell through the cracks? I did not hear from any manager last night, and still haven't.

That night, I was scared for my safety. The guy followed me outside as I ran to my car, him jumping in front of traffic to chase me. He proceeded to grab my door before I could close it, and tried to grab me as I struggled to pull my door closed. I screamed for help several times. I was thankfully able to get the door closed after struggling to push him off it, but next time any other woman may not be so fortunate. This all could have been prevented if someone, ANYONE, had stepped in, even just for a moment. 

I tried twice to discuss this directly with the manager in a helpful way, but I think any woman deserves to know that she will be absolutely, totally on her own. The management does not care about your safety. They do not care about you. PLEASE BE SAFE.",4.5,2,"['769 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65367360000001,-70.2713788,"American (Traditional), Bars, "

The minute you walk in, you are welcomed into the darkness with stone walls and dim lighting which gives it a dungeon-like feeling. Think Game of Thrones meets Harry Potter. 

The thing I appreciate about Bramhall is their cocktail selections. They have unique cocktails that are handmade, and they also have a specific selection of cocktails made with local liquor, which I thought was cool. They also provide some limited options of local beer and wine selections. Bramhall also offers some food selections that tend to be pub-like food, ranging from chicken wings, to a burger, to various other shareable plates. I have gotten their fries, which was very thin and good, and I have also tried the burger, which was surprisingly great! 

The only thing that keeps my review from giving it five stars is the service. Every time I have gone in, the servers and bartenders are nice, however, it sometimes feels like the staff are more enthused with their phones over the actual customers. When I went the other night, I was sitting at the bar and I finished my drink, and it took a while for the bartender to notice I was empty to ask if I wanted another drink. A small fix, though, Bramhall definitely has a unique aesthetic that adds to the Portland bar scene.

I honestly thought the place was called Dungeon Bar after a friend called it that when I asked for a place with a really good hamburger. Regardless, it does live up to that nickname in the form of a dark, candlelit atmosphere with black beamed ceilings and it's location underneath another restaurant. 

We had a rotation of servers who attended to us at our table, so all night we felt taken care of. However, be warned! The seating options are a bit, well, uncomfortable in the back of the space. There are the worlds tiniest stools (restaurants, get a clue--most people have butts wider than twelve inches) or a bench with leather cushions but the cushions get pushed around a lot. There were a few high tops around too, but they weren't available. 

Mild discomfort aside, if you want a good, simple burger I highly recommend. Great taste, potato bun, perfectly cooked and flavorful bacon, a delightfully oozey fried egg, and a special sauce guaranteed to make your mouth crave more. And the chips that come with as the default side are awesome--whatever that spice blend is, keep it coming!  I opted for the fries as my burger side and they are shoestring style.

My friend led the way down the stairs (where aroma Cafe is) and as I pulled back the velvet curtain, it was like I was transported to another time period. It was very gothic feeling with the stone, candlelit ambiance, and overall underground feel. 

When you've time traveled to the past, why not order a whiskey? That's what I did. And I don't drink whiskey. But I enjoyed it! And I felt like it was appropriate for the place I was in! My friend and I ordered garlic fries (happy hour special) and they were delicious. Think shoestring fries-very thing and crispy. 

The bar is lovely and expansive. We got perfect view of the leg lamp from A Christmas Story as well as the bartender separating egg whites to include in some speciality cocktails. There are some small tables as well, if that's more your style or are with a group. The bathroom is fun and clean. You open the doors saloon style. The sink is very industrial with foot pedals.

Bramhall is right under Roma Café and is almost in a basement style location. All the walls are brick and the dim lighting and old style doors just reminded me of all the buildings at Hogwarts in Harry Potter. It almost had a dungeon feel (not in a bad way though).... Super cool place. 

It is seat yourself, so once you walk in, if you find a table, it can be yours. We came on a weekday around 7P and there was no issues finding a place to sit.... and we were a group of 6. 

The drink menu is extensive with ample selections of cocktails, beers and wines. I ended up getting a couple cocktails, both of which were delicious.... however, for the life of me I cannot remember either of the names (sorry!). 

I am also big on doing a taste test with everyone else's drinks and I can't say there was one I tried that I didn't like. All the cocktails had a unique and different taste. 

The service was consistent and we were checked on regularly and brought our drinks quickly. 

Unfortunately, given our later reservation at Roma Café, I did not get the opportunity to have their food. However, based on the looks and descriptions in the menu, it seems like they have some really tasty options. 

This is definitely a cool place to hang out and get some tasty drinks. And if you want a good Harry Potter vibe, I definitely recommend coming to Bramhall!",4.5,2,"['769 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65367360000001,-70.2713788,"American (Traditional), Bars, "

The bar chairs don't have high backs, which is a constant pet peeve for me. Bar was nicely appointed spirit wise. Many local craft beer options, and a wide craft cocktail list. 

I would suggest that the food is uninspired here. My first pub grub at most places is their chicken wings....they were below par here. Ultra heavy breading and under spiced. My GF had the pork terrane. I tried a couple bites...it was ok, with mustard, gherkins, and toasted points as a side add.

It was my friends birthday and she got a lot of perks which was very nice. If you go here you should bring at least $30 with you because everything costs like $10. A lot of people got chicken fingers and a lot of people got burgers. We all had French fries and they were divine! Shoe string fries! Another thing that I liked about this place was the candle display in the center. It was like a shrine and because I was sitting near it, it kind of felt like a shrine to me. For drinks I got the Salty Cat, which was perfectly salty, and the Crowley, which had coffee in it so it was like an upscale four Loko.

Bramhall might be for you.

I have a wild imagination. And sitting in Bramhall, I could:
1. Be in Edinburgh, or San Francisco, or Montreal... it's got a very worldly feeling to it, and transports you right out of Portland, ME. 
2. Be in Ragnar Lothbrook's great hall circa 700 to 800 AD waiting to party after hearing where we're raiding this spring.
3. Be in Diagon Alley having a drink before making a dark magic deal... or busting one. It depends on if my emotional pendulum is swinging towards Good or Evil that night.

Too weird? Okay:
1. The cocktails are varied and delicious; they are also reasonably priced.
2. The scene is very laid back; it's in a subterranean space; there is also an enormous patio that's much more generic feeling.
3. The staff is friendly and quick.

Examples of such magic...

2. The porch in the summer.

3.  The amazing brick arches that make you feel like you've slipped back in medieval times.

4.  All the drinks are incredible as are the charcuterie plates.

5. I recently was meeting a lovely lady there for a second date. Upon arrival, there was some loud, head banging music playing over the speakers.  Our amazing server/bartender came over and got my drink order, (they are always very speedy with the service), and told the server my situation. I needed a mood set to which she responded ""do you want slow jams or chill?""  Then we had a brief discussion about the vibe and she put on something perfect to hang out to.  

Now this might seem like no big deal, but asking a server or a bartender to change their music selection rarely goes over this well.  When my date arrived (around midnight after work) she was able to get a cheese plate, with olives and a variety of other delicious spreads.

The atmosphere is killer. I love dark, subterranean bars. Hell, bars are dark. If they aren't dank, that is a bonus. This, my friends, is a bar. In the basement of a building, exposed brick, archways, you feel like you are in the basement of some bar in Riga, Latvia in the basement of a medieval building. Candle light the joint, and small nooks and crannies of seating add to the romantic ambience and Bohemian vibe of this joint. 

The drinks are to die for. Cocktails are top-notch. The bartenders know their craft, and they do not hesitate to fill a request based off a recipe handed to them. Order cocktails, skip the beer, go somewhere else for that. It will be a shameful waste to drink a pint of suds when you could drink mixed nirvana in a cocktail glass. 

The staff is exceedingly accommodating and friendly. Superior service.

I've never been greeted by a host or hostess, which can be rather refreshing and although it kinda seems like your walking into someone's basement (I guess it's because we're  in Portland, right?) I appreciated the friendly staff and they make a decent burger! 

With that said, I thought I was walking into a Resturant to have a burger tonight at 10pm, but instead walked into a scene from the Walking Dead.

Since Brmahall normally has serval seats available, I was shocked when they had a line at the for entry? Once I got the the door and could see inside, I noticed they were the same as most nights, pretty empty. So imagine my surprise, when I was greeted for the first time ever, by a security guard.  

Not a host nor hostess, a security guard. I'm a 35yr old women, I just drove an 1hr from working an 11hr shift in Waterville, to be approached by a security guard to enter a Resturant, seemed strange. So like most normal, red blooded Americans would, I ask, what with the id's? The answer was abrupt and rude: to drink. 

Because Bramhall does serve one of the latest menus in town and I have to work tomorrow morning at 8am and will make the drive again tomorrow morning, my response was, ""I'm not drinking."" I asked again, did something happen here at Bramhall, why you would need my id at the door and there's security here now? 

Was there a reason for security at a Resturant?
Did something violent happen?
Was Bramhall busted for underage drinking? 

Whatever the case, I do not feel necessary to be harriers by a low life security guard with nothing better to do, than to be an asshole. When walking into an establishment to eat a sub-par burger in a basement.

Atmosphere: Speakeasy, hip, dark, intimate. Brick walls, dark woods tables, largely candlelit. This is the type of place where secret lovers (should) meet and where brooding men come to think, look sultry, and sip on fine whiskey. 

Drinks: I forgot my ID, so I missed out on the Prohibition era cocktails and had water. I see this as an excuse to go back soon!

Food: Started off with the meat and cheese plate. It was so tasty! A broad array of flavors. It was gone in 2 minutes. For my entree I had half of the Kentucky Hot Brown (Rotisserie Turkey, Tomato, Bacon, Mornay Sauce, Parsley, Pullman Loaf, Served Open-Faced, $12) and half of the Grilled Ham and Cheese (Ham, American Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, House Jam, Pullman Loaf, $10). Both were amazing! The Kentucky was super creamy and melty and was the perfect comfort food for a cold night. The Grilled Ham and cheese, on the other hand, was spunky and flavorful with quite the kick from the jalapenos. 10/10 would order again. 

Service: Our waitress was awesome. Besides clearly being an cool person in her own right, she was attentive and SUPER knowledgable. We asked one question about a whisky and honestly she schooled us with all of her knowledge. She wasn't condescending at all, but rather so interesting that we  just started asking her questions about other things and she kept up with us every step of the way. 

We finished up the night with the cheesecake of the day (Peanut Butter/Chocolate) and some sort of (insanely yummy) rice crispies drizzled in some sort of sweet/zingy dessert sauce. I would eat one every day if I could.

It does kind of feel that way with the brick interior and melting candle display in the center. Unfortunately unless you're literally sitting at the table right next to it you can't really see it. Bramhall is located in the basement in what used to be The Roma (or was it La Roma?) restaurant. I love that this place is far enough away from the old port that you don't get the drunk 20 something's that are finding out what it's like to have their first drink. I also love their cocktail menu, yes they have beer and wine too but the cocktail menu is the star. My favorite drink so far is the ""nurses aide"". (Disclaimer: I'm a nurse so I had to try it when I saw it on the menu). Cocktail prices are $8-11, pretty typical for this area. Also, no parking lot or garage that I know of in this area. You have to take your chances finding street parking or illegally parking somewhere. 

They have a couple of food items, too. I've tried the peanut butter marshmallow bars, and get this: They have bacon in them! I absolutely loved them. One of my friends really liked them too and another friend thought they were ""meh"". We also had the loaded crisps which were BBQ chips covered in sour cream, bacon, cheez whiz, and scallions. We all loved this. I would definitely order both of these food items again. The service here has been great here too, they will come to your table and take your order if you don't want to wait at the bar. 

My only complaint is that about half of the seating here are tiny metal un-cushioned barstools. After about an hour sitting on one I was so uncomfortable that I had to stand up. My butt was numb! My girlfriend offered to switch seats with me because she had a cushioned seat. We stayed another hour or so and my friend said her butt was hurting from sitting on the stool too.

I'll be straight - I have been out of Portland for more years than I have been in it, even if I was born here. It doesn't surprise me all that much anymore, but when I see something like Bramhall I really start to wonder if I've really ever known Portland at all to begin with. What a strange and interesting little place. What creative graffiti in the women's bathroom. What a scrumptious pulled pork sandwich. And what a strange dish my husband ordered, which I don't recall the name of, but was absolutely exquisite. 

The place is so bizarre and specifically not-characterizable that I almost wouldn't recommend it to someone visiting Portland.

Upon its reopening, it's been given a facelift. The bar has moved, the pool table has been replaced with table seating and the cheap beer has been replaced with artisanal drinks and nice microbrews. 

The place is dark... Dimly lit by candlelight. It makes for a nice ambiance, but it makes it very hard to read the menu.

I also got the ""garden nibbles"" or some other cute name- which was house made hummus with pita, and some vegetables on skewers. The hummus tasted like nothing; literally had no flavor. The pita was alright- but the grilled vegetables weren't anything special.

The bar is very dark and mostly brick and stone, but the materials are upscale. This isn't a dive bar, but it's not a cocktail lounge either. It's new and different and I love it.

The lead bartender came from Gingko Blue, so you know you're getting some of the best cocktails around. At about half the price. An old fashioned-like cocktail was $6.50! The beer and wine menu are printed in a faux middle ages book, but the cocktail menu hasn't been finalized.

A little hard to find if you're not looking for it but totally worth going to. I felt like like we were in an ancient medieval cellar that had been converted to a speak easy during prohibition.

Enter (another) basement venue... hang your coat and join in the buzz of a brick basement with little nooks and crannies and coves with yet more brick and arches with candles and benches and chairs. 

I didn't like the menu one bit, as it was highly whiskey-oriented, but the bar tender was immensely patient with me in devising options based on what I liked (but he didn't quite know how to make) and what he knew how to make. In no way did I feel like I was holding him up from someone else waiting to order a drink, which was awesome given I'm that person who loses a great parking spot because of the fear of holding up traffic to parallel park. Instead, he saw it more as a challenge to solve a problem and please a customer. 

Better yet, the dude at the door checking ID noticed we were hanging out without chairs and grabbed us the moment a table opened up. What service!! 

And, better yet... the server in the back of the bar was just as awesome as the bartender! He took the time to chat, to challenge, to educate and worked with the bartender to create my menu for the rest of that night. I have no idea what I drank--they likely weren't really drinks out of a book (aside from my chocolate martini), but they all tasted good and were priced very fairly (same as an uncustomized drink). And, although at one point the bricks were spinning a little, the server kept us hydrated with water on the side, so we left with a thoroughly great night in the back of our minds.

Okay, I'm sold on that idea. The bar is a whole is awesome, covered with bricks and stones, with dim lights and candles on every table. There is a great centerpiece in the middle with candles and wax dripping about. I was really digging the vibe in here- it could be a perfect place to hang with friends or an excellent place for a date. The first time I came here the Jerks of Grass were playing, who were great, and as far as I know they play here on Thursdays still? Only thing that I wasn't too fond of were the chairs- little barstools for the tables that were not too comfortable, but I got over it.

So originally, like many places, we just came here for a drink, but natural had to order food as well. They have really good drinks here and the prices are fair too. There are good craft beers on tap and domestics in bottle. They also have Downeast Cider in a can, which I love, and don't see a lot of places.

We were just snacking so didn't get much but they have a decent sized menu, for a place I thought was just a bar with ""light snacks"". There are sandwiches, appetizers, salads, and desserts. I got the wedge salad, hold the bacon, and it was a lot better than I expected it would be. Not that I thought it would be bad, it was just really good. It was huge, came with a red wine vinaigrette, blue cheese, tomatoes, and garlic breadcrumbs. Yum yum yum. My friend got loaded crisps, which were also so delicious. I don't eat bacon but I picked around because  they looked awesome, and they were. The base tasted like bbq lays chips but I do believe the menu said ""house seasoned crisps"". I don't care what they were, they were good. They were coated with cheese wiz, smoked bacon, sour cream, and I think scallions. We all inhaled them after saying we weren't going to eat much. My other friends got these bacon infused rice krispie treat things covered in a peanut sauce. They were on special and a few people were intrigued over these. I didn't try them because they certainly did not appeal to me. Other friends were not fans though, and they were happy they were cheap and on sale.

All in all,  good food for the snacks we tried, great drinks, and one of my favorite bar atmospheres I have been in. Will absolutely always return to Bramhall when I am home visiting.",4.5,2,"['769 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65367360000001,-70.2713788,"American (Traditional), Bars, "

If you use Google maps to find Bramhall like I did, trust that your iPhone has not accidentally lead you to the gates of hell like I initially suspected; the entrance is a nondescript and completely unmarked stairway leading down into an underground abyss. Perfect for those who like speakeasies, but a nightmare for those who have a low tolerance for ambiguity.

Bramhall is a much warmer and cozier lair than one might think for a basement space made almost entirely of brick - especially on a cold February evening that delves into the single digits.  A group of us came for happy hour on a Friday night. It was really the perfect, laid back vibe we were looking for.  Nooks and crannies hide tables throughout, providing a space for quiet, candlelit conversations over a pint. Pro tip: Don't come soaked in kerosene or apply an excessive amount of hairspray, because there are seriously a lot of candles everywhere.

Happy hour is decent - discounted beers ($3 or $4?) and food menu. They make homemade crisps (chips), either plain or smothered like nachos.  We also tried a hummus plate - both great value for $4. Service was OK - nothing special but not bad either.  I wasn't a great fan of their beer menu on that particular night, but they had the local staples like Substance. The taps'll rotate, so I'm sure it'll be different when you check it out!  Next time, I'll be taking a longer look at their food menu.",4.5,2,"['769 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04102']",43.65367360000001,-70.2713788,"American (Traditional), Bars, "
4364,IFVqt80ROGRWq884m7rWCg,bramhall,4364,2015-03-26,"I went to Bramhall for two reasons:

First: I frequented the former Bramhall, as a neighborhood bar, to play (and lose) at darts and pool, and was intrigued as to how they renovated the space and the menu.

Second: Jeff is a bartender here. He was fantastic at Novare Res, and I happily follow my favorite beverage schleppers wherever they may be out of personal comfort. If he is your bartender and is for some reason not the friendliest and most accommodating person that I've always seen him to be, either someone has just been a serious ass and he's shaking it off, or, you're probably an ass yourself. 

I have not been disappointed with the changes. I've seen and heard the terms speakeasy-esque, dungeon-y and such associated with the new Bramhall and I'm inclined to agree, in the BEST way possible. The new owners really cleaned up, but it IS in a below street level spot with brick and stonework exposed, so it is going to have that appearance to a point, especially when the candles are lit. While my twenty-something self is a little nostalgic for the slightly more grubby pub it was, the vibe is still fantastic, and my thirty (cough) plus self enjoys the new look. 

During one of my last visits I was feeling indecisive and the bartender, whose name I can't recall, (sorry), made a drink off the menu for me that I chose at random, but then still wasn't quite what I was looking for once I sipped it. While the name is eluding me, it had tequila, ginger beer, pink grapefruit juice...and something else. I asked if he had anything with some heat that could be added and he promptly went to get what he said was a bit of ghost pepper from the kitchen. This was exactly what it needed. SO accommodating! 

Bramhall is still a neighborhood bar, which I appreciate as a West Ender. Come here to meet, for the most part, other locals, and maybe a few adventurous tourists, although this is less likely due to location, drink some craft cocktails, have a few snacks. It's the right kind of cozy that  encourages you to engage with people as you're ponying up too the bar or looking for a table. I've had some great conversations with new people because we bumped into each other while ordering a drink or looking for a seat. Are you going to have to squint a bit, and perhaps pull your cellphone out to see the menu more clearly, likely.

Then menu is short and succinct and perfect. We shared jerk chicken wings, hot, but they were not killer spicy and had a nice crunch to the skin. We also shared a plate of crisps.

They could be an appetizer or a dessert and Peanut Satay dipping sauce really puts this over the top. 
I had the Tuna Melt which came with seasoned homemade kettle chips. Tuna Melt was served open face and was seasoned with tarragon and topped with dressed arugala. Super tasty and light on the mayo.

Liquid Riot was one of a few stops for a bachelorette party before going somewhere for lunch.

Some of us ordered some light appetizers in the meantime or a flight of beer for $16.99. I just went with a stout that looked interesting & it was good (Sweet Dreams 11%). 

The atmosphere is really fun! It is a place to hang out at for a while. I did see that they had a lot of merchandise available for purchase. We didn't stay long enough to fully get the full experience but I find that it is an awesome place to go.

Service was somewhat slow (though it wasn't super busy from what we gathered) & our waitress seemed annoyed with us when we had requested separate checks (she didn't even ask how we wanted to divide them when we ordered) but you would think a group that large would want it separated.

HAUTE FASHIONED No.2 ($13):
Liquid Riot House Whiskey Blend (using Maine-grown rye), bitters and sugar or simple syrup. I asked him to make it with less sugar than what they're used to because I dont like my Old Fashioned very sweet.

It has no free customer parking so we paid $20 to park 2 vehicles in the lot behind the brewery. We waited to be seated though there were many empty tables. Our party of 4 was told we couldn't sit on the patio because it was full, but I could see space from where our table was sat. I told myself perhaps the waitress assigned to patio couldn't handle another table. 

We were seated near the ""merchandise"" section which I would have liked to explore as we collect beer glasses, but it was under lock and key in a cage that you have to ask to be let into and presumably a member of waitstaff stands in there with you? The fact that t-shirts needed to be caged up made me feel like they didn't trust their clientele. Perhaps they don't? Shouldn't? I don't live around here, you tell me.  Anyway, asking to look felt like a lot of claustrophobic pressure, especially if I changed my mind so I skipped it. 

We came to Portland for beer, food, and music, not shirts and glasses, so we all ordered a flight containing different beers as well as their award winning fernet and a salted orange soda. Everything left something to be desired, and most of the darker beers had strong tobacco notes and little complexity. The fernet was closer to chamomile mouthwash than an herbal refresher, but bitters aren't generally my style to begin with. The salted orange soda was good, but could have used at least a teaspoon more syrup as it was more dark yellow brackish soda water than an adult version of pop. 

I wasn't getting any phone service inside the restaurant to plan the rest of our evening so I asked the waitress if I could have the wifi password (there are 3 networks, one of which read ""Liquid Riot Guest,"" so I assumed I was okay to ask.) ""Nope, no wifi here."" she replied. No problem, but she seemed more annoyed I dared to ask then apologetic. The busboys made frequent rounds clearing flights nearly as soon as they were finished, and the waitress came back often to see if we were going to order more than a flight each.

4411,R2dk5oImVATJduKsAI1PKQ,liquid-riot-bottling-co,4411,2017-10-30,"I love some of everything Liquid Riot is doing.

Atmosphere/Seating
I like the dark wood that the interior is almost entirely comprised of. In a really bizarre way (what I imagine, that is) it feels like being in the hull of a pirate ship. There's bar seating, high tops, coveted comfy couches, and let's not forget the pretty amazing deck overlooking an intimate part of Portland's working waterfront. 

Customer Service
Every single time I've been here I've had rad customer service. Laid back servers who are still quick to get you your order or right a wrong without hovering or disappearing altogether once you're settled in. On the opposite hand, I haven't felt the same warmth from whomever staffs their tasting tables at events throughout the city - bummer.

Drinks
Like beer? Try their flight of four. Like cocktails? Ask the staff what they love (they're actually those kind of real people that will tell you straight what they actually like, what they don't like, and what's unexpectedly popular).  

Food
I mean, essentially it's elevated pub food. But they do it so darn well. Can I just say how charming it is that the pretzel is shaped into an infinity symbol? That *has* to be a shout-out to the previous name of this place. The pretzel is one of the best in the cities, FYI (I know, I've now eaten pretzels at EVERY place in town that serves them). Also, the fries are reeeeeeal good (get ALL the sauces: the gochujang aioli, the Liquid Riot beer cheese, and the spicy hop mustard). I believe the poutine (fries, local cheese curds, Blue Note porter mushroom gravy, squash puree, and arugula) is vegetarian; I haven't had it yet, but it's been on my radar for ages.

When I think about going out, this has become one of the first few places that now immediately come to mind.

The atmosphere is top notch. It feels spacious, warm, with a huge bar and couches towards the back. The staff here is nice and easy to talk to... well, if it's not a busy day. When it's really busy it can turn into a bit of a shitshow. I'm sure with such a large capacity staffing appropriately can be a guessing game. 

They usually have 8-10 of their beers on draft in a variety of styles, some neat cocktail ideas, and their own spirits in .5oz and 2 oz options. 

Really the only food I could endorse here would be the pretzel and the french fries, and those two things are really, really good. I'm not sure the burger is worth $14 without fries, but it's decent. I don't like mushrooms, but I could see the mushroom toast being popular. My suggestion is to come in on a not too crazy evening, have some beers and fries or a pretzel and I don't know how you couldn't leave happy.

Unfortunately, the menu beyond that has rarely impressed and this last time was a real bummer. We had the house salad, falafel, and the wings with memphis dry rub. The salad was fine but the wings were somehow seasoned with that dry rub and also totally bland. I don't know if they just needed some salt or what, but they were some of the most flavorless chicken wings I can recall eating. I honestly don't even know what the falafel was. I've also posted a photo so you can make up your own mind. You can maybe see in the back what the outside looked like, it wasn't remotely crispy or crunchy like falafel usually is. Instead it was almost like a vegan meatball or something. The inside seemed like raw dough and not very chickpea-y. We didn't finish either and ended up going home and cooking. If it had just been a hair in there and it would have been easier to send back, but we didn't because I'm thinking... is it just a matter of taste? Am I an asshole for sending these things back because it's just my palette and others actually like this?? I don't know, open another tab, Google falafel and see if they look remotely similar.  Stranger still is that it's a very small menu so you would hope they had the few things they cook on lockdown. I can tell you if you're looking for traditional falafel, please go to EVO or Baharat and skip it here.

I recently visited Liquid Riot, based on the beer and food menus I read online, but was overall disappointed with my experience. Based on our drinks, the liquor was better than the beer options. For example, I love IPAs, but I thought most of the beers were a bit bland and weak.  We shared a few apps, but ended up leaving before dinner because we were underwhelmed with the food. In addition, it definitely felt like a bar crowd, rather than a brew pub, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. I'd probably be likely to go back on industry night for a hot dog and beer, but wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner with so many other great options for food in Portland.

The guy working was very knowledgeable about the brewing process and local brew houses. He told us the wood stools, counter tops, etc. you see came from one tree!

The outdoor seating is what sold me. You can drink your beer and watch the ships. Wicked cool if you're not from Portland. We loved it so much we sat outside while it was raining. Another worker strolled by with a huge tub of yeast. He said a local farmer was picking it up to use as feed for this pigs....another cool fact. 

After several beers and more conversation with the beer masters behind the bar we learned more about the brew house. Someone told us Hoof Hearted Brewery (beer equal to crack back in Ohio) loves Maine so much they distribute their beer around Portland. You simply can't find this beer in Ohio.

Nestled into (I have no recollection of what this building used to be!) a spot on Commercial Street right on the waterfront, Liquid Riot has a fairly large interior with plenty of seating. Windows open up to the brewing & distilling facilities on one side, and the waterfront on the other.

The beers were tremendous, and we took home (to Colorado) bottles of bourbon & whiskey to enjoy, and they've been fantastic. Service was a bit slow, but it didn't really negatively impact anything as the food was really excellent.

While on vacation in Maine, my best friend took me to Liquid Riot Bottling Company (LRBC) in Portland. Actually, she gave me a list of places to choose from, and LRBC was one of them. She said their food was great, but the service last time wasn't the best. I decided to give it a shot anyway since I wanted some good beer. 

When we arrived, the hostess asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar. My friend said we wanted a table. So, she brought us to a small table... in the corner, right by the bar. That was fine expect nobody came. Not one person came to take our drink orders or ask how we're doing. Nothing. It was like we were invisible. I started to think maybe my friend was right about their poor service. 

And then! Our hero came along: the bartender! He ended up taking care of us the whole night (perhaps that was the hostess's plan the whole time) and he made me completely forget about the fact that we were ignored by the rest of the staff. He was charismatic and made us feel welcome. LRBC--your bartender totally saved the day! Well, that and your most amazing food.

Everything I tried there that day was on point. You can see all of our dishes attached to this review. But I'm only going to mention my three favorites:

1) Ichigo Cream (strawberry cream ale)

I normally order dark beer like stout and porter, which I did that night. But when I tasted a sip of my friend's Ichigo Cream, I had to have my own pint! Something about that beer made me sing. 5*

2) Maine Hot Chicken   

Again, this was my friend's dish and I couldn't stop stealing bites from her pate. You wouldn't think maple syrup dipped in black pepper sour cream, but it was outstanding. I love that the chef took a simple item like popcorn chicken and then used some creativity to bring it to a whole 'nother level. 5*

3) Fried Dough with Mocha Stout Dipping Sauce

Do I really need to say anything? Exactly. 5*

At the end of the day, my friend and I had a wonderful time at LRBC and the food was some of my favorites from the trip. Even though our experience didn't start off too well, it ended up being magical. Despite their issues with service, I would recommend LRBC because of their food and beer.

4454,R2dk5oImVATJduKsAI1PKQ,liquid-riot-bottling-co,4454,2017-10-06,"I will start off this review by saying I had very high hopes for this place. Great selection of beer, fun cocktails, and what seemed like an interesting food menu. Unfortunately, our experience there was so poor that it motivated me to write my first ever Yelp review-- not in an attempt to cease business-- but in hopes the ownership can read this, learn, and grow the business into its potential! 

We brought our party of 10 here on a Saturday night last month. I work in the industry and understand how busy nights can affect the kitchen, staff, etc... I can go into how the servers didn't give us the right beer flights, barely knew the menu, and so on, but none of that really inclines me to write this review- 

We were out with my sister-in-law who at the time was 6 months pregnant. When she ordered her fish tacos, she made a point to tell the waitress that she needed her food cooked extra well done to be safe, and the waitress completely understood. When she received her food, her fish was not only undercooked-- it was RAW! Completely blue and cold and quite frankly not something anyone should receive, especially a pregnant woman. I got the fish tacos too and mine were fine, so how does this happen??

When we notified the waitress, she didn't even seem concerned! What's worse is that I would have expected at least a manager to come to our table, check in, and apologize profusely. We spoke with a manager when this didn't happen and he seriously could not have cared less. I have NEVER in my life experienced service as horrible as I have here. Never thought I'd be that person writing a review to bash a business, but I seriously was in such awe at the whole scenario!

4460,R2dk5oImVATJduKsAI1PKQ,liquid-riot-bottling-co,4460,2016-05-30,"Liquid Riot's existence has been a bit of a roller coaster. The bar has had a deeper identity crisis than Caitlyn Jenner. Lately though they've really gotten it together and have become a top 5 favorite bar of mine in Portland.

The smartest move by Liquid Riot was leveling the space. Without the weird ""RiRa-ish"" elevated section, the room is now essentially one humongous bar. And it's awesome! This is one of the largest bars in Portland, with plenty of seating at the actual bar, various tables or couches. This is also one of the few Portland restaurants with an outdoor deck on the water (that no one seems to ever think of). If nothing else, come here just for the beautiful seaside deck. It's worth it. 

Liquid Riot is the only bar I've seen where all of the beers and hard alcohol are house made. I prefer the beers here to Gritty's (just awful) and Sebago (ok). The cocktails are creative and several utilize an ice ball machine, which mesmerizes. The food has taken many iterations over the years, and is at its best now, as pub food. The hot chicken ($11) was popcorn chicken coated in what suspiciously resembled Bingas Spicy Redneck sauce. It was delicious and packed solid heat. The pork belly ($12) was typical melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Surprisingly, the veggie dishes are some of the best, with the Brussels sprouts being fantastic. You come to Liquid Riot for the drinks, but the food can hold its own now.

Service has vastly improved lately. With great alcohol made in house, a big attractive space and decent food, this will be a regular hangout all summer.",4.0,2,"['250 Commercial St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6544609069824,-70.2542877197266,"American (Traditional), Bars, Breweries, "

4481,R2dk5oImVATJduKsAI1PKQ,liquid-riot-bottling-co,4481,2017-06-10,"This place can be safely classified as a brew pub.  It has its affected pretensions, but scratch it just ever so lightly, and there's a brew pub.   I make this point because over it's existence, both in its rebranded form as Liquid Riot, and before as something called Infiniti, I've found the food odd, and the attitude superior (as in superior to me).  The prices reflect that attitude more than the food quality, I think.

The restaurant, both in its cavernous interior and the sunlit deck waterside, was not half full when my son and I visited.  We sat not outside on the attractive deck, but just inside at the bar,  out of the sun.  

For a brew pub, the menu did not have a broad selection of accessible food.  Instead, there were some effete vegetable and tofu dishes, some duck-ish things (not actually a sign of inventiveness, but a bow to the local duck-pioneer Duckfat, a smaller, less expensive, and more popular restaurant), and a couple of meat sandwiches. One of which was a cheeseburger.  We ordered that.

When it came, the size was OK for me, I'm not a big eater, but it was almost petite, and bare of condiments.  For a $16 cheeseburger I expected a little showboatin'.  Instead, we each had a modest cheeseburger with a dab of onion.  My son did have ketchup, but it was served in a small paper cup and was there for his fries.  I had no fries so was given no ketchup.

I asked the waitress for ketchup and mustard. She brought one more little cup of ketchup.  I said again that I still needed mustard, and that my son also needed ketchup for his burger. She told me he already had ketchup, but I pointed out that the ketchup he had was not enough for both his fries and his hamburger.  She mumbled something and returned with a single small dish of mustard, and another of ketchup.  We're not talking about handcrafted ketchup and mustard, built with locally-sourced tomatoes and carefully tended mustard seeds from a garden the chef keeps out back.  From the bar you can see into the kitchen, and I saw there that the condiments are spooned out of a massive tub of Heinz ketchup and a similar tub of mustard. 

I grew up in an America where mustard and ketchup were de facto components of a hamburger.  I do understand that hamburger making has become a field with a thousand flowers.  That there are now iconoclastic chefs building exotic hamburgers with wildly original ingredients (I'm looking at you 5-Star Burgers in Kirkwood Missouri), and that many of those hamburgers would be adulterated by adding Heinz ketchup and something like Grey Poupon mustard. 

The hamburger we were served, though, on June 10 at Liquid Riot in Portland Maine, was not one of those hamburgers.  This was like the hamburger Thomas Jefferson had in mind when he asserted, in the Declaration of Independence, that a hamburger should be served with ketchup and mustard (mayonnaise too, but I think he said this just to mollify Lafayette).   Pretty much just a hamburger.  Like you'd find at a Brew Pub.

After we'd finally gotten our condiments, we lathered up the little fellows and ate them.  I've had better, I've had worse. 

I also ordered an iced tea.  I know this is a brew pub, and that craft beer and (maybe?) spirits are their ""thing"", but it was a warm day, we'd biked a few miles into town, and I wanted tea, not beer.  

The tea came. It was just an iced tea.  I drank it. The waitress asked if I wanted a refill. I said yes. She brought me a refill.  I drank that too.

We move now to a discussion of the bill.

In all, I ordered one cheeseburger and a dab of onion, a small bowl of cole slaw, and an iced tea.  My son had one cheeseburger and a dab of onion, a handful of french fries, and a glass of milk.

The hamburgers were $16 each, the milk was maybe $2.  The mustard was $1, the iced tea was $4, and the iced tea refill was $4. 

In short, I was charged $16 for an average burger, without condiments, and $9 for two modest glasses of iced tea with lots of ice and 2 ounces of mustard.  I've eaten at restaurants up and down the Portland Waterfront, and well beyond.  I've never seen a $16 burger that wasn't pampered in some way.  I've never paid $4 for a run-of-the mill iced tea, then been charged again for a refill, and I've never been charged a dollar for mustard - for a practically naked hamburger.

You may think my complaints are trivial, but I think this nickel and diming speaks to Liquid Riot's general attitude toward customers, an attitude that matches the company's troubled history with its branding, which is cluttered, shambolic, and off-putting. The place doesn't know if it's fancy or simple, cheap or expensive, hipster-snooty or tourist-common. 

I know the answer though: A place with a name like Liquid Riot is a brew pub, and at a brew pub, no one should have to pay $1 for mustard on a $16 burger, or $4 for a refill of a $4 glass of iced tea.  Condiments and tea are not precious bodily fluids to be retained unnaturally.

Lucky for us, bar was first come first serve and we scored two seats within less than ten minutes of waiting. 

This restaurant seems pretty unorganized. They only had one bartender for brunch on a Saturday and no bar backs. This guy was fulfilling every drink ticket, going to their storage (he kept having to go outside) to get more champagne, and serve all the bar patrons.

Our beers were very warm which was disappointing for an 8 dollar beer but at least it was poured right away. 

Unfortunately, it took over an hour from when we placed our order for it to come to us. We didnt asked where it was but other people around us were having a similar situation and when they'd ask where their food was the bartenders response was ""we are busy"". Poor planning to not execute quicker knowing you'll be crowded at brunch time. The food itself was great. I really enjoyed my sweet potato hash and biscuits with raspberry jam.

Biscuits and gravy are rich and delicious, but don't leave me feeling too full. I love that you can order this as a side instead of the whole meal.

They do a great hash, and often have very inventive specials. The gnocchi Benedict (on the everyday menu) is something you won't see too many other places, and it comes loaded with cubes bacon or pancetta. Highly recommend trying it.

Can't endorse with a full 5 stars because of one small hiccup that could have been handled better.  The most recent visit we did have an issue where we both ordered poached eggs, and all 4 egg yolks were completely cooked through.  The server apologized and replaced them with new eggs, but didn't offer to replace the full dish (so it was room temperature by the time the new eggs were ready). To be honest we probably would have said to just bring the new eggs anyways because there was nothing wrong with the rest of the dish and I don't like to waste, but either way I think a 5 Star spot would have at least offered to replace the full dish or comp something small on the bill.  

Also - bring back the red flannel hash!",4.0,2,"['73 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.66727,-70.24649000000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), "

I've been coming here for almost 5 years and typically always get great food and decent service. My most recent visits have just not been anywhere near what they used to be. The past couple of times have been pretty inconsistent for both food and service, but a recent visit just ended any sort of joy I used to have coming here.

I arrived here on a Saturday morning for brunch with my girlfriend and we were quickly seated by the super nice host next to the hosting booth. It was a little more busy than the rest of the place but still a good spot. When our server came over, that was when we first noticed things weren't the same as past visits. She was very short with us, very rude and didn't even mention the specials until we asked (the special hash they had that day was phenomenal). We ordered our drinks and received everything in good time. 

It all fell apart when we asked for jam - I had asked for jam since we both ordered toast and she promptly left to get it before my girlfriend could finish also asking for jam. When she came back we attempted to ask for refills and ketchup, but the second we asked for ketchup she was already walking away (she did toss it on the table before ignoring another request for jam). Thankfully he host was great and refilled our drinks. 

Right in the middle of our meal we saw a couple come in w their dog and asking to be seated outside. What happened after was just disgusting. She had found a tick on her dog and instead of goi outside decided to crush it right next to our meal. With the host right next to her, we couldn't believe she too didn't say something! 

At that point we both lost appetite and when the server came back, she didn't even ask us for a box. 

She just took our plates and threw everything out!

I have never been disappointed at brunch.  EverythAng for brunch has been spot on.

Dinners are a different story.

I have had some meals, where they've knocked it out of the park.  The bluefin tuna special comes to memory (approximately 2-years ago)...  it was so good I still remember it.

The eggplant parm - also very good... solid choice.

And I have had multiple, multiple meals where I walked away disappointed...  Just didn't know what the chefs were thinking that night but completely missed it.

So to end my long drawn out story.

Dinner = be cautious.  You may be disappointed.

However, if you  stare into the eyes of the hostess, and you have even the slightest sense of compassion,  you will realize that your hunger pains aren't the end of the world; the hostsess has it worse than you.  As my stomach growled and i thought about which girl from the annoying bridal party I would eat if we had to turn to cannibalism, I realized I would rather chew off my own hand. Alas, my boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year anniversary,  so I needed my hands for later.  Hands are totally underrated. Or maybe mouths are overrated.... I digress. 

Anyway, if you find yourself waiting an extensive period of time to be seated: just stare at the hostess. She is holding back a mental breakdown, and she is suffering an entire shift of hangry sons of bitches. Is she doing a great job? Eh, I don't know that she's doing a great job at her actual job (she told us the wait was a half hour, and we came back in 15 minutes only to find we were scratched off the list. She also busses tables at the speed of a large tortoise )...but she's definitely doing a good job of not screaming, crying, or joining in on Portland's heroin epidemic. For that, I applaud her. 

Now, food? You will wait for this too. I figured we were just waiting on the chickens to lay the eggs. And maybe the chickens are free range and so we were waiting for the eggs PLUS the finding of the eggs. Fortunately,  the waiter was so stoned that it made the waiting  period completely worth it. I envision that maybe he even got the chickens stoned because time was not of the essence.  Patience Is a virtue, though,  so one could call this a virtuous breakfast. It depends on how full of s*** you are as a person. I don't judge. 

My man lover had the huevos rancheros. He said they were good, but far from traditional (but he could have been talking about me. I was too hungry to think straight).  I had the corned beef hash, and i would comment on it similarly.  I almost went with the gnocchi but I'm anti- hollandaise because I don't like when big loads are just dumped on my eggs. The hangry older woman sitting at the adjacent table ordered them, but I could tell by looking at her husband that the breakfast load was the preferable load option. 

Mimosas were a nice touch to the meal. Kind of livened things up for us and gave us energy for the day. Plus,  I was still getting over the fact that my heartthrob's omission  about having a golden retriever. That's the kind of thing you need alcohol to recover from.

When you tell people where you're going to get brunch and they all tell you the same thing, ""get ready to smell,"" you know something's up. Even as I met my brekkie date, the very first thing he mentioned after greeting me was, ""So the ventilation in this place..."" I cut him off. I had heard. And after waiting for him for only five or so minutes, I could already tell food smell was seeping into my clothing and hair. I understand the older building wasn't necessarily meant to house the restaurant, but... Open a window! Light some candles! Do something!

Now let's talk 'bout the pertinents and such of this place at brunch.

Service
The server had an incredibly friendly disposition... when we saw her. She did the absolute minimum for service that she could - took our order (food and drinks at the same time), slid drinks onto our table without a word as she was passing by, dropped the food off without a word, dropped the check off and wished us a ""very fabulous day"". She never checked on us once, and it wasn't even that busy. When our drinks had sat empty for twenty or so minutes, we finally caught her attention and asked for more water. When I look back on my first time here the word ""parched"" will be one of the first to come to mind.

Food
1. Veggie gnocchi
Ugh. I wanted this to be amazing, and it fell short. To begin with, the whole thing was wet (there was a noticeable amount of liquid swishing on my plate), the poached eggs were overdone (as in - they were lsoft-boiled), and the gnocchi were positively enormous (the size of clementines, and they were both dense and a bit flavorless). I still enjoyed it... I just wouldn't get it again. Or crave it. Or recommend it. Here's hoping it was just an off day!

2. Special morning breakfast bread
I had no idea this was even a thing. My brekkie pal asked if I wanted some of the special morning bread (I don't even think this is what it's called, but we're going with it for now as I can't find it on the menu). Today's option was chocolate strawberry. THIS was the highlight of my brunch. THIS is something I would go back for. Grilled and slathered in butter (I also specially requested a side of strawberry jam because it really brought the whole thing together), it was one of the chocolatiest things I have ever eaten EVER. And, y'know what?, that's totally okay with me! It was just lovely with my perfectly brewed iced coffee. So, if you come here for bunch - get the special morning breakfast bread WHATEVER it may be... you will not be disappointed.

3. Homefries
While I wanted them, I didn't have the home fries. My dining cohort suggested they were not the best in town and as such we didn't order them. Segue...

4. The bowl of fruit
I didn't want any fruit until I saw the table next to me get some. A heaping bowl full of beautiful, colorful melons, berries, and grapes. For only $4? THIS is a bargain!

I believe the outdoor seating, specialty mimosa (today's was mango - SO wish I had gotten one), and breakfast bread is definitely where it's at here. This is a quality brunch spot and I definitely recommend checking it out at least once. Just, maybe, don't order the veggie gnocchi or wear your Sunday finest!",4.0,2,"['73 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.66727,-70.24649000000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional), "

Speaking of sweet, our server couldn't have been more accomodating, ready with an answer or a refill, even in a packed room.

The only dim spot was the sip of a loose, watery Bloody Mary. It had the heat proper from the house-infused jalapeño vodka, but the mix left a bit to be desired. Hell, even the Venus de Milo is missing a few limbs - doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece.

We arrived for dinner and after driving around a bit, finally found parking. Luckily it wasn't too far away, since there was a nice steady drizzle. We were seated within a few minutes of arriving. Within 10 minutes we were already having a conversation with the nice couple that were seated next to us, just finishing their dinner. They seemed impressed to see that my mother and I travel together for a long time and can stand one another! haha. They mentioned that they were locals, and assured us that we made a good decision. This happened before we placed our meal orders, so let me tell you now I was super confident that I selected the right place!

Within 15 minutes, I had a glass of merlot in my hands, and my mother was telling me that I don't need to drink a lot, so that should be my only drink for the night. haha.  At that moment, I realized just how much I love my mother... no really.

We started with the Cast Iron Skillet Cornbread- my mother is a southerner so cornbread is her favorite. So she is picky about eating other people's cornbread haha. But let me tell you this cornbread was just how she likes it! Plenty of edges, just a bit crispy and buttery... a little sweet. It was perfect... compliments to the chef. I want the recipe!! *wink* haha

I ordered the Braised Beef Short Ribs that is served with mashed potatoes (regular for me, versus the horseradish style), roasted red cabbage, and braising jus. The short ribs were melt in your mouth, fall off the bone delicious! Nice rich flavors! The flavors of this dish really complemented the merlot I selected. No question, it hit the spot. BANGING! I was in food heaven, sitting with my mom, and quite frankly nothing else mattered at that moment. Front Room... y'all made me really happy! This meal absolutely made my trip and gave me life! But wait... there's more. Girl, you had dessert too?! YAASSS. Lol! Key Lime Pie. That is one of my absolute favorite desserts... laaaaawwwddd y'all did it to me!! And it was made in house with a lovely presentation!!! OMG- Did I say I was really happy?! FOODGASM!! 

My mother ordered the fresh fish of the day, I believe it was swordfish, served with soft potenta, spinach and a olive vinaigrette. She added the roasted brussel sprouts appetizer also- which I so happily indulged in. Very good!

Service was excellent. Its a loud place, but I loved the kitchen and the entire feel of this place. Oh Front Room... how I love thee. Your food gave me life and happiness.

4583,AuecSQtLH2oUwXEXZEv1gg,the-front-room,4583,2016-11-10,"Was there a couple of Sundays ago,  AM for brunch during our first visit to Portland. Though breakfast was free in the sub-par Marriott Residence inn, we thought it would be nice to go out and catch a meal at a local place. 

We arrived, and had a 5 minute (if that wait), were seated, greeted, and provided coffee very quickly (my most important quirk about breakfast places - get me that hot joe asap!). The place was packed and not the quietest place, but I liked that it felt lively. Unlike our home state of MA, we were happy to see an open bar at 10AM, and availed ourselves of a Bloody Mary and Mimosa.

Food was nice. Wife had eggs\home fries\ham, and I tried the potatoes and loved them. I tried the Potato Gnocci w./Spinach and Hollandaise. Gotta be honest here .. I think the poached eggs were the best I've ever had, sauce was terrific. But there was way more spinach than I expected as as a couple of others have said, it got water and drowned the few pieces of potato buried underneath. I could be this is really a dish meant for vegetarians, but I would have preferred a bit more potato and about 1/2 of the amount of spinach and also cooked differently to reduce the moisture. Regardless, we enjoyed the food and atmosphere.

I HAVE to mention that I saw something here I've never seen before in a breakfast joint or diner .. there was a group of people waiting for a table, and I noticed that the staff brought them coffee to drink - while they were waiting. That, to me, is just awesome customer service.

Little Tap House is a small, unassuming place on the corner. There are some barrels posing as tables and you see the bar as soon as you walk in. I took a seat and the bartender took my drink order. I got a sangria and a cheese plate

The sangria was awful. That wasn't sangria and I don't know if it was meant to be a hispter spin on a classic, but it was a complete fail. It was awful. I'm too nice and just sipped switching off between it and water so I could choke it down. The cheese plate was good, but hard to screw that up.

It took a lot of time -  A LOT - for the bartender to focus his attention off of talking to the two guys at the bar about how he's a Washington, DC native and la dee da. Got my check and went on my merry way.

My last night in town I was elated to be heading home after a really long week. I figured, I started my first night at Little Tap House, I'll finish there, too. Thought maybe it would be better. I just wanted something a little sweet and a glass of wine.

Wine list by the glass was extremely limited. The Cab was way too sweet and I wasn't a fan. I ordered a half-cooked brownie with sour cherry jam. Picked the cherries off and ate some of the brownie. It was a D. What was so odd? He sat my drink at the end of the bar for a couple of of minutes as though a server was taking it to a table, then he went and grabbed it and delivered it to me.

Once again bartender was talking to another guy who was from DC. We get it. You're a DC native. Can you just pay attention long enough to place an order and get a check?

They have a nice selection of regional beers.  They also have some nice sangria and cocktails.

They change their menu to reflect what it is in season and available from the local famers and providers.  This seems to be a staple for Maine, which is fine with me.

My husband and I only had some small pates and appetizers: Canadian (deviled) eggs, popcorn with marrow butter, etc.  It was very good.  The popcorn was bit heavy on the lime -- but I think the chef was trying to brighten up the flavor of the butter, which makes sense; just seemed a little heavy on the lime.

I've been here a couple times, and both times it was for their awesome Happy Hour specials.  It really cannot be beat.  You get a draft beer and appetizer for LITERALLY $5!  The kick is, you don't choose it, it is pre-selected (the beer and appetizer are chosen by the restaurant, and whatever the deal of the day is is what you get, it changes every day).  The appetizer I had yesterday when I was there was an open faced pork flatbread type thing, which was super tasty and well worth the $5 on its own, without the beer!  The beer of the day was an Oxbow Saison, and the flavors of the app paired so well with the flavors of this beer.  It was a perfect marriage in my mind, and again, it was $5, and I honestly couldn't pass it up for that reason alone.  We sat at the bar and the service was prompt, bartender was nice.  The only thing I thought was odd was that she didn't check in with me after I received my food to check in, but meh, not a deal breaker.

We came here on a Wednesday night and were surprised about how busy it was. Even for a Wednesday evening, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes prior to having a place to be seated. We ended up getting seated in the regular dining area despite only coming for drinks and apps.

The good news is that their happy hour deals are available throughout the entire restaurant and not just at the bar.

Their $5 beer and app options vary daily. It is a specific beer with a specific app. Being that I am not a picky person, I still decided to go with it. I can't remember what the beer was, but the app was a hummus plate. The hummus was served over two pita's with some pickled onions. I know it sounds simple, but this was hands down some of the best hummus I have had. The hummus paired with the pickled onions was fantastic. I was so close to ordering a second order.

We ended up getting a second beer and an order of their chips with the beer cheese. The chips appeared to be homemade and the beer cheese dip was very tasty!

It's a fairly small space relatively speaking, but once you are inside, the focus quickly turns to food and drink.

The staff here is great. It seems like a family. I see the same smiling faces every time I visit. They seem uber organized, but at the same time so casual and easy going.

There is a decent bar/high top area just as you walk in. There is a TV near the bar area as well.

The menu is creative and everything they prepare seems to be well thought out and crafted and when it all comes together, it feels ""fancy"" in such a casual environment. That's one of the things I LOVE about this place.

They are active on social media posting the latest beer lists, which is usually why we end up there. AND unless I am extremely full, it is hard not to order food.

This is a great place to visit before or after a show or event in Portland. While they don't have a private lot, there is plenty of pay parking nearby. Keep in mind there will be slight inclines as you walk to or from the restaurant if you walk there. But for me, it's totally worth it.

Wanna know why?
IT IS THE BEST LIL TAP HOUSE IN THE LAND.
For real, though.
On the corner of Spring & High, this is a place you've probably driven/walked by numerous times and thought ""huh, that's cute"" and then either never thought of it again, or you did what I did and went there to experience its wondrous ambience and plentiful options.

Little Tap House has a mega tap list, so be sure to bring your boozy appetite. You can sit at the bar, or at a table that's made out of a beer barrel. It's cozy inside, but not pretentious - servers are friendly and generally pleased to discuss menu items with you.
I have to say, their watermelon margarita is probably my favorite cocktail in Portland.
It's like someone scooped out a watermelon, threw in some alcohol, and poured it into a glass with some additional watermelon in it. It is so delicious and fresh, I could have ten in a row (though I won't, as I'd probably die).
They have little specials where you can get a certain beer and certain snack for $5 or so. Outdoor seating in the summer is fun, though it's a high traffic area, so be prepared to shout over engines and passerby to get your conversation across.

I would give this five stars except for that it is so unreasonably loud in here sometimes, it makes me want to wear earplugs .There's an odd acoustics thing going on where if there is a shrill-speaking person at one end of the bar, you can hear each of their words perfectly at the other end. This makes the delicious food you're eating a bit less delicious.

Otherwise, this place rules. Come here to have a delish local beer while looking out the windows at High Street and stuffing your face with reasonably priced appetizers.

Having driven past many many times, when glancing from my car, I had only been able to notice two barrel tables in the front part of the restaurant.  Barrel tables that looked uncomfortable and like no place I would ever want to sit.  SO the other night when a friend texted me and asked me to meet her at Little Tap House, I initially tried to persuade her to meet me somewhere else.  She held her ground and THANK GOD she did.  Five minutes later, I met her at a comfortable, corner TABLE, where we both shared a pretty spectacular dinner.

We started with a homemade potato chip app with a beer cheese dip and a beet carpacio.  Both were fantastic and gave the clear message that the kitchen at LTH was staffed by some serious talent.  We then shared a house burger with fries.  The burger was perfectly cooked at medium rare and the fries were INSANELY good!

Feeling pretty great about everything at this point, we decided to order dessert.  We ordered both a gigantic ice cream sandwich and a new option of shortbread cookies with a smoked citrus curd.  These desserts were both so incredibly delicious, each in their own way, that in one moment between bites, I realized that what might have been a solid 4 star review, had just been knocked out of the park to a 5!  The shortbread cookies were so exceptional,  I had an emotional experience after the first bite.

Before leaving, I started staring at the dishes coming out of the kitchen and everything looked amazing!  I am SO returning!

Pros:
Very friendly wait staff. 
Great selection of local and craft beer.
Nice space and decor.

Cons:
-I thought the happy hour selection was a bit weak. Only one beer of their choice came at a reduced price along with a few wines and a single small bite option. 
-The food options looked tasty but the prices are a bit steep. I think we expected it to be a bit more casual, at least at happy hour. We ended up just ordering drinks and an order of the parmesean/balsamic fries (which were Ok but not something I'd return for) and continued on for dinner somewhere else.

I got a flight of local beers, and shared the poutine and the Casco Bay board, which came with smoked salmon. While I can't speak for the authenticity of the poutine, I can say that it was delicious and hearty. It was tough getting through the huge portion, even with someone to share it with. The Casco Bay board wasn't as impressive; in addition to the salmon, there were crostini, hard boiled egg slices, picked radish, and capers.

The food was very good, the service was very good, but the kitchen totally screwed up our meal.  We ordered the popcorn of the day, local honey and sea salt.  We asked that the salt be held but should have asked that it be lightly salted, because having no salt threw off the balance.  That was on us.  I ordered a red blend and Alan ordered a beer sampler.  There were two beers rather than the usual three, four or five, because he only wanted to try dark ones.  One he liked and the other he didn't like that much because it had an aftertaste, although he finished it.  

In addition to the popcorn we ordered Brussels sprouts to share.  I ordered a house salad and ale braised brisket.  Alan ordered the hamburger w/ unsalted fries.  Our server said she would bring them out in courses.  The popcorn was interesting and cool.  We finished it and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Our server kept checking w/ the kitchen and she reported back to us, but a party of 4 seated after us got their food and we were still waiting.  By the time our server reported the kitchen said it would be two minutes, we were pretty angry.  I was not looking forward to the walk back in the dark.  The Brussels sprouts, salad and our mains arrived all at once.  It felt as if the kitchen had thrown our food at us.  The food was very good.  I liked the Brussels sprouts and the brisket.  The salad was large and nicely composed.  The dressing was a little astringent.  It was improved by the addition of goat cheese from the Brussels sprouts.  The brisket came w/ onion rings and carrots.  I gave Alan an onion ring and a bite of brisket.  Even as angry as I was the food tasted good, but it would have tasted better if it had been served in a timely fashion.  Alan liked his burger and fries, a lot.  

He offered to go back to get our car and pick me up and I gratefully accepted.  He left me his credit card so I could pay.  Our server was very apologetic, although it wasn't her fault.  Unbidden, she took $12 off our bill for the wait, which we both appreciated.  I'm not sure we'd return, even though the food was tasty.

With that said, onto the food and drink. We split an order of the calamari as an app. While the portion wasn't huge, it was just right for two.

I ordered the fish tacos and my partner got the burger with sweet potato fries. Our waitress was friendly and it was pretty quiet. We sat in the back towards the kitchen. I've had a couple drinks at Little Tap House before and sat at the bar but it was a good Sunday afternoon atmosphere. 

My tacos were presented well, with a newspaper wrapping underneath - kind of a play on ""fish"" news. The waitress told me they use it for their fish and chips but thought it was cute to add to the fish tacos. I agree. You get a lot of meat for the fish tacos and the fish cuts were good but my only gripe is they were a little bland. There is a mayo sauce with lettuce that goes on the tacos but it was missing something. Might have been that the fish cuts were too big to accommodate the flavor the sauce was supposed to provide, but anyhow a little bland for me. Maybe some spice could be added as an option?

The burger however was delicious. I had to steal two bites instead of just one. The sweet potato fries were also cooked just how I like 'em - crispy but not burnt. I would definitely recommend their burger and go back for another one next time I'm in the mood.

5 stars for beer selection and their BYOB (Bring Your Own Baby) events
3 stars for lack of vegetarian options

The best thing about Little Tap House is in their name - their tap list! Ever changing, always local, and always GREAT options for all beer enthusiasts. From dark to light, seasonal and everything in between, you will find something you like at LTH. The staff can usually offer their opinion, or will get you a small sample if you can't decide. There are so many great Maine beers here, I am always pleased.

The atmosphere is fun, decor simple and lovely, and staff have always been friendly. They have a monthly BYOB event on Sunday afternoon, and it is a great way for new parents to get out, have a drink and socialize with other new parents. Each month has a fun (usually seasonal) theme, there is a professional photographer and the place gets packed full of babies, toddlers, and parents! We see a lot of familiar faces at these events each month. It can get a bit chaotic, so if you're not there with a kiddo, I'd avoid during this time. But for parents, it is really a great way to feel like a normal human for a few hours!

Lately, I have really only been going to LTH for the BYOB events, because while their food is tasty, there are VERY limited options for vegetarians. I get that it's a pub, but I could design an entire menu of vegetarian friendly hipster pub foods.

~Section 1~
My counterpart and I had heard that Little Tap House had an excellent brunch that was seriously flying under the radar compared to the heavy hitters in town. Excited at the prospect of a new place to eat my favorite meal at, a friend and I met Saturday mid-morning. Let me preface this by admitting she and I are both vegetarians. Our options, therefore, were pretty limited:

- The Bloody Mary ($5 on Saturday/Sunday mornings): Was a NO go. They pre-make their bloody mix in the AM and it includes Worcestershire (which, as we know, has anchovies). They will NOT make you a fresh drink without Worcestershire, and since I don't drink fish, I couldn't get a bloody. Huge disappointment here.

- Triple Cheese Grits with two eggs ($9): This was pretty much the lone ""brunch"" type thing we could order. While it's said that the grits are made with smoked cheddar, cheddar curd, and swiss the only things I could really taste was a lot of salt and generic cheese flavoring. Our eggs were cooked great, but... I think without the addition of Sriracha, we would have eaten less than we already had (my counterpart didn't even finish hers).

There definitely are other options for vegetarians: house chips with truffle parmesan and beer cheese fondue ($6, but I'm guessing that it's deep fried alongside meats, so that turns me of), cauliflower gratin with - again - beer cheese fondue ($6, what's with all the beer cheese fondue here?), and a grilled cheese (made with cooper sharp, tomato tapenade, and caramelized onions) for example. For me, personally, there's nothing food wise here that excites me. Unfortunately, vegetarians just don't fair well with pub fare, which is essentially what LTH is offering.

~Section B~
What DOES excite me - and what I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE about Little Tap House - is:
a) their Bar & Barrel app and draught $5 offering during Happy Hour Monday through Friday. Sure, most of the time it's stuff I can't eat. But every now and then there are gems (recently: tomato bisque with petite grilled cheese paired with ""Gose"" by Rising Tide Brewing Company, for example); 
b) every time I've been here the staff has been just VERRRRRRRRRY nice, patient, and accommodating as much as they can be; 
c) the space and interior decoration... there's A LOT of wood here. And I REALLY like it. I feel like I could be drinking in the Captain's quarter of a fashionable pirate boat (this makes no sense, I'm sure, but... it's just the very unique vibe I get);
d) the BYOB (Bring Your Own Baby) events they have for new mom's once a month that encourage they come out AND bring their babe with them. Don't have a kid myself, but damn it if this isn't one of the coolest things any bar in town is doing, then I don't know what is.

We went to Little Tap House on my friends and my biweekly brunch schedule.  It was so good that I definitely will be back.

It was beautiful out but quite windy so I was happy to sit by the big windows in the front and listen to the live guitar music.  The menu is brief, but from my experiences well executed.  My friends ordered the chef's board, the house salad and the monte cristo.  I personally had the cauliflower gratin (which I'm referring to a cheesy cauliflower because I am a heathen) and the poutine (because I clearly was on a cheese binge that day).  

Have you ever had poutine that was soggy because the fries were not cooked enough and they absorbed too much gravy.  These were not at all like it.  The fries were crispy and the bacon was generous.  What more can you ask for?

We did receive an amuse-bouche of a tomato soup, it looks that that is pretty standard.  I personally cannot consume tomatoes, but my dining companions did tell me it was awesome.  Even if they do give this to everyone, I like the concept of giving a little extra something that isn't the standard bread basket.

The environment here is very homey, with a true family feel where the staff either know everyone or want to know everyone. Even though it was our first time, we ended up feeling like regulars by the time the meal ended. 
It's a small and very popular place, so either call and make a reservation (especially if it's for a party if more than 2) or hope to get seated at the bar, which is where we ended up (perfect seats to watch march madness).

For entrees we ordered the asparagus risotto with mushroom dusted scallops and WOW was it incredible. So creamy and fresh. It's no wonder that it has been recommended by so many others!

I've heard the rave reviews but have honestly never headed over because after praising the food, people almost always mention how cramped the space is and how it often feels impossible to have a private conversation.  
So one Friday night, after being sick for an entire week, I realized I was starving at 9pm, and suggested to my husband that we walk over and see if we could get a table.
When we arrived, the place was surprisingly busy, BUT there was one table available.  We were seated promptly, and yes, we were close to a cabinet that held things the waitstaff needed, and very close to the next table.  We tried really hard to keep our voices down, especially when the couple next to us appeared to be having a special night out.
A most lovely waitress came to take our drink order and answer questions about the menu.
We decided on the pistachio mussels and stuffed mushrooms, and then an order of eggplant rollatini to share.
Bread and herb butter was brought right away.  While we were waiting for the apps, I was able to really look around.  There do seem to be some tables along the back wall that have more space, and therefore, more privacy.  In the front room, it appeared to be mostly high top seating, which I know can also be tricky for some people.
When our apps arrived, we really liked the stuffed mushrooms, but LOVED the pistachio mussels.  These were by far the best mussels I have ever had, and I love mussels!  
The eggplant rollatini was also fantastic, and I LOVE eggplant rollatini!

We had reservations and the one friend of the group who had been here prior said it was one of her favorite places to eat. The rest of us as newbies decided to give it a try. As you can see by the star rating, I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. 

This establishment is on the outskirts of the Portland downtown. It's located in almost a strip mall kind of building. Parking is limited and the space inside is tiny! The bar space, forget it. There are only a handful of tables which is fine but it feels like all the tables are on top of one another. Our table was up against some piece of furniture containing glassware so those two people didn't have a lot of room. I sat on the side with more room but had the air conditioner blowing on me and it was freezing. Good thing I wore a sweater. But even with that, it was way too cold. 

There were a ton of specials on the specials board. I asked about the Chicken Romano and it sounded good based on the description from the waitress: chicken that is coated in egg, pan fried, and served with a garlic sauce. What I got served was a small appetizer sized plate with chicken and a cream sauce spilling off the plate (and actually spilled on another friend's dish as the waitress served it). There were garlic mashed potatoes but barely seen because random steamed vegetables were scattered all across the top. It made me question f this restaurant even has a person who works the kitchen to approve the presentation and quality of the meals before being served. The meal was lukewarm and didn't have much flavor. I thought a garlic sauce would be garlicky, like a scampi or something, but this wasn't that way. 

Our dinner reservation was for 7pm and we were seated right away at that time. At 9pm, having finished our meals for a while, we still did not have our check. Our waitress was not attentive to us throughout the meal, didn't ask how our meal was, and someone else cleared the dishes. Since 2 hours for dinner was enough in this tiny and frigid space, we had to chase down the waitress who finally gave us our check 10 or so minutes later. 

This restaurant was a disappointment. The generous two stars are for the bread and garlic butter that came with the table. Other than that, I don't plan on returning to this establishment.

Cute little restaurant with a wide menu that is sure to please just about anyone. 
For our appetizer we got the short rib raviolis (thank you yelp for the recommendation on that one). So good! They were pan fried, had the short rib on top, and came in a shallow bowl with some au jus. So yummy!! I could have had it for my meal, this is a must order. 
For dinner we had one of the chicken specials (with garlic mash and veggies) and the veal Constantine over pasta. Both dishes were amazing! 
We finished with the lemon raspberry panna cotta. Sooo yummy! It had lemon zest in it that did a great job of brightening the dish without giving an overpowering lemon flavor. We will definitely be returning.

The menu is varied, with an emphasis on southern Italian favorites. There are always 6-8 specials on top of a strong menu. 

The four of us shared a few apps. The short rib ravioli are good, actually a dish with some nice finesse to the sauce...which was a light, beef based au jus, with very nice flavor. The bruschetta was also good, with a nice but somewhat heavy mozzarella covering over rustic tomatoes. We also tried the crab cakes, which were tasty. The remoulard  sauce, that accompanied, was a bit unimaginative, but overall it was a decent dish. 

My main course was a veal, seafood, pasta and sauce medley. It was a ton of food, with nothing preparation or flavor wise that was negative. For me personally, it was a bit bulky, with too much sauce, and too breaded of a veal application. This is a bit of a nit pick, and overall, I'm sure this is a strong favorite.

4705,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4705,2017-09-01,"Well - I'll start by saying that the food at JPs was very, very good. That is the only reason I haven't given them one star today. 

The service, however is another story. I called and made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for my boyfriend's birthday. When we arrived, I was told that the reservation was not in their book. They made me look through all of the reservations listed over 3-4 days not once, not twice, but three different times. I told them that my information is not in the book, yet I have documentation in my phone from the day and time that I called and made the reservation. After a back and forth I asked them to please remedy the situation and seat us because they were embarrassing me in front of the guests of our party. 

RELUCTANTLY, the host brought us to a table directly next to the kitchen. Several members of the staff made it a point to vocalize that we needed to get in and out of the restaurant quickly, since we didn't have a reservation. Two servers talked about it openly right behind my boyfriend and I while they were standing in the kitchen and our server mentioned it outright to us when we asked for a few more minutes to review the menu - stating we needed to make a decision quickly. 

Then, we weren't brought any bread (unlike every other table in the restaurant), so I stopped a server walking by and asked her politely if we could please have some bread. She rolled her eyes, went into the kitchen and then dropped the bread onto the table. 

The icing on the cake (birthday pun intended) however is that when I told our server it was my boyfriend's birthday, she then asked him what he would like for dessert. She brought out the bill a few moments later and had charged us for the birthday dessert she INSISTED on bringing out. $9 for Tiramisu. 

I could not have been more embarrassed and felt more slighted. I went out of my way to ensure that our plans for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party were solidified well in advance and then because of someone else's mistake we were made to feel like burdens until we left. 

Again, the only redeeming quality is that the food was good. But I don't know if I'll ever go back simply because of the fiasco they put us through.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

We were staying with our inlaws nearby and after a long day with the three year old, didn't think we'd be able to get downtown and back without a meltdown. And because we were on vacation, as serious foodies, we wanted a decent meal. Yelp steered us here and we could not have been happier! As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a small place. We didn't make a reservation - but went right away when they opened at 4 p.m. They were able to seat us, but did say they needed the table by 5:30. Worked out fine for us since we knew the little one would be losing it by then anyway. 

They have a great wine list for a place of this size - including lower end quality options like the William Hill Chard and the Angeline Pinot. Plus a LOT of fun varietals from Italy - we went with the recommendation of our server in terms of the varietal (Montepulciano) for our meals. We both ordered the short rib ravioli which was to die for delicious. I had the scallops with risotto (which was pretty good, though the scallops were a bit overdone) and my partner ordered a special they had going - some sort of seafood lasagna that was also quite tasty. They were lovely about bringing out some simple things for us to have the three year old eat - some plain pasta, cut up cucumbers, and bread. We also had a lovely chocolate cake desert.

Their list of specials is extensive (to say the least) and allows you to tailor your meal to your liking by substituting nearly any meat with any pasta/sauce you see. Their cocktails are always recommended by the waitresses and they're usually pretty strong!

On my most recent trip, I shared the Calamari and Asparagus Salad. The asparagus was by far my favorite! I've been pleased with all the entreés, except for the Linguini in White Clam sauce. I'm not sure what made up the sauce, but it looked like millions of tiny little baby clams... While it wasn't exactly unpleasant, I wouldn't choose to eat it again.

4710,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4710,2015-03-21,"JP's is a not-so-secret little gem. Located by Cumberland Farms in Rosemont Center, the space is small but attractive. It's become quite busy so reservations are a good idea, and be prepared for close quarters.

The namesake chef is somewhat of a local legend. He formerly worked at a series of more divey bars (Samuels, Bernie's) which was an odd fit for his upscale cuisine. You can order a variety of foods off the regular menu but the expansive specials menu holds the best surprises. Think rich dishes of fish, chicken and veal loaded with butter and oil. JP's is definitely not health food, but it is delicious. Last night the chicken francese and swordfish couldn't have been better.

With the flood of expensive, small plate restaurants opening in Portland recently, JP's is a relief. The portions are as substantial as the menu and you'll leave completely stuffed. Price points are slightly cheaper than downtown too in the $18-$23 range.

On the advice of a friend we did go down to crossroads Rosemont, not Rosedale, and checked out JP Bistro for the first time.  It takes up two units in its 1930's strip-mall (like Congress Street's club Blue) which makes for an intimate setting; especially since one unit is taken up by a bar-type arrangement with high tables, and the kitchen.  

We started with a prosecco wine for my wife, while I tried a house mixed drink called 'porto manhattan', a manhattan made with port wine instead of sweet vermouth.  The acidy wine cut through the sweet bourbon in an interesting way.  Though I prefer a sweeter mix this would be appreciated by those who like a dryer drink.
 
Our server brought freshly made crusty bread (oh, heaven!) and a ramekin of butter which was mixed with garlic and herbs and the tastiest we've had for several years.  For a main course I checked out the veal piccata (lemon sauce and capers) which was tender, slightly piquant, and savory.  My wife ordered her go-to meal of ribeye steak which comes in two versions; Bourbon and ... I've forgotten ... with french fries.  She said that was very good.   I like vegetables so I pay attention to them:  These were sauteed, firm but not underdone.  I chose rice instead of pasta so as not to override the taste of the vegetables and piccata sauce.  All in all, a very satisfying experience in one of Portland's signature-type small restaurants.

The Details:  You definitely need to make reservations; come early if you want to park in front.  Mixed drinks, $10 range.  Entrees generally between $20 - $30.  Interestingly, the owner has chosen to break out Maine's minimum wage escalation separately on the check so if you chose to you could adjust your tip in compensation, though I do not.  Servers work hard for their money.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "
4716,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4716,2017-03-06,"Been living in Portland for years, and this is my first time trying JP's. A friend and I came for dinner to try something new. The place was absolutely packed. The waitstaff were pleasantly dealing with the crowd as best as they could, but it was a little claustrophobic. Our table was right next to the china cabinet near the back of the ""main"" dining area, which made it awkward for us to chat with our waitress. We also had another waitress reach over us to grab something from the cabinet. Nothing to terrible, it just made it a bit difficult to enjoy the ambiance.

I ordered a couple of glasses of wine, neither of which I was especially fond of, but I'm no wine aficionado,  and the waitress did make an attempt to suggest an option, but I went ahead and chose something myself. 

Prior to our main course, I ordered the bruchetta for an appetizer, which came out in a reasonable amount of time. The toast was perfectly toasted, and the tomatoes were on point. This was a solid appetizer. Also the bread and garlic butter was delicious.

Because I had never been here before, I chose to order off the menu instead of ordering a special. I believe that a restaurant should always do their stand bys on a menu perfectly. My choice for my meal was (if my memory is correct) the chicken campagnola pasta dish. It was linguine in a wine sauce with cherry tomatoes, chicken, sausage and peppers. The first few bites I thought were a bit bland, with the sauce being a little watery, but as I delved more into the dish, and the ingredients marinated amongst one another, I ended up enjoying the end result, though was a bit underwhelmed.

Okay...so why three stars? When we got our bill, it was well over 90 bucks for the two of us, and my friend didn't even have an entree. We aren't cheapskates, and I knew going in this wasn't going to be simple Amatos food, but for what I had, it was quite expensive. Also attached to our bill was a mandatory gratuity because of the new Portland minimum wage. According to our waitress, this is for additional staff or something like that, who do not get tipped, so we're compelled to pay a regular 20% tip on top of the mandatory gratuity on our bill. This left a bad taste in my mouth. If you are going to make a mandatory gratuity, do so for everyone, including waitstaff, so I don't need to pay separate gratuity.  The minimum wage is only 10 bucks right now, I mean come on.

I likely won't feel the urge to return any time soon.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

Terry served us and kept everything coming at a steady pace, including the watermelon jalapeño margaritas which were also increds!!! She knows her job and does it very well.

When I went to the restaurant, I thought I should have eaten there! Great atmosphere, great wait staff, and seating at the bar for dinner as well as outside. The aroma of good food hit me when I walked in. The person who took my order hustled to finish some orders and quickly got mine to go.

Wondered if fish to go was a mistake, but haddock is a firm fish and the Parmesan crust made it hold up well. I was eating it maybe 15 min after pickup, and it was yummy.

4743,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4743,2014-11-13,"Dining at a place like JP's Bistro makes one reevaluate all the five star ratings they've handed out, as all of a sudden you realize other places just can't be rated the same as JP's.

How to begin, the food was spectacular, the service was spectacular, and the atmosphere was great.  

The first night I ordered Shrimp Athena, the wife the crab cake appetizer and a half order of shrimp scampi.  We're not used to places that offer you half orders of things.  It's not noted on the menu, but worked out great for us.

My Shrimp Athena was one of the very best meals I have ever eaten in my life.  The shrimp were large, perfectly cooked and plentiful.  But the sauce really made it so special.  My wife surprisingly allowed me a taste of her scampi, and it was unbelievable too, the best scampi I've ever had,  quite a different style to it.
So when we were done, we got up from the table, and went to the hostess station to make reservations for the next night, our last night on our vacation here.

The second night I had chicken Parmesan, the wife shrimp scampi again, and French onion soup.  She said the soup was great, and guarded her scampi from me this time.  My chicken parmesan was great, quite different from any I've had, and a very large portion which I couldn't finish.  The one bad thing was that my side of linguine was kind of cold.  

The service was amazing.  It wasn't stuffy, the emotionless proper service.  Everyone we interacted with was genuinely friendly, and very helpful.  The first night the managers little brother who was in training, was our server.

The menu on-line is less than half of what they actually had, as on a blackboard they had specials listed.  It was very hard deciding as there were so many things that sounded good.  The manager helped me decide on my entree the first night, and as I said, it was a remarkable dish.  The hostess called us the second night as we were on our way, saying they had a cancellation, and remembered we wanted an earlier time, saying we could come in sooner.  The manager brought our drink orders the second night simply from remembering what we had the night before.

I have never been made to feel so special at a restaurant as I was here.  Everything contributed to this, but the friendliness and great attitude of the staff is just remarkable.

And the prices are surprisingly low.  Our meal the second night came to $44!

They only have about seven tables, plus two high tops at the bar, a small space.  Reservations are needed.  It is a lovely place, with great atmosphere.

If we lived within an hour of JP's, we would be dining here every other week at least.  

The one really terrible thing about this place is that we have nothing like this at all where we are from.

My mom was in town, so my wife and I wanted to take her out and try something new in the process.  All three if us were very happy with our experience.  To get started we all shared an order of crab meat stuffed mushroom as well as an order of muscles.  The muscles in particular were very good.  

Both my wife and I ordered the scallops with mushroom risotto and both of us loved it!  It's a heavy/rich meal so come with your appetite intact.  My mom got a seafood casserole from the specials board that she was a big fan of as well.  

Our server was great.  Enthusiastic and very knowledgable about the menu and specials.  Loved the cocktails, but if there was something to gripe about it was the seemingly excessive wait for cocktails to arrive after ordering.  

JP's is a pretty small space so reservations would be wise and where we were sitting it was pretty loud.  That doesn't bother me, but I know others feel differently.

 We started with the short rib ravioli. I could have eaten them all night long. They were that tasty. The appetizer actually out shined the chicken Marsala I had for my entree. I was good but a little rushed. The coating on the chicken could have been browner which would have made the dish a bit richer. Also, could have been stronger on the Marsala. Overall, better than some concoctions masquerading as chicken Marsala that I've had. My wife had a very delicious linguine with white clam sauce. Really a white wine, garlic broth. Tons of clams! Yummy! The hot bread with the garlic herb butter hit the spot. As well as the demi garden salad with house Gorgonzola dressing we had between courses. This place is great.

The service was OK both times, although neither server seemed very knowledgeable or concerned about the menu proper.  There were, however, many specials and our server had some solid recommendations.

The food is Italian for the most part, and the chef certainly knows how to cook, even if the fare is a bit heavy on the stomach.  There is no real steak or pork chop on the menu to speak of, and there was a lack of creativity ingredient wise when I was there;  it was all very fresh.

The atmosphere is nice, the kitchen is active and the bar is quite large.  The wine list is adequate and served us nicely.

We started with the short rib ravioli appetizer that was savory and just to die for with the ribs cooked perfectly and so tender it  they just melted in your mouth. Next were the pistachio mussels,  Prince Edward mussels prepared with pistachios,  white wine;  garlic and lemon. It was more than ample for the two of us and absolutely delicious especially with the pistachios. We then couldn't resist the seared scallops with mushroom and asparagus risotto. .sooooo smooth and creamy and the asparagus had just enough crunch left in it.

Asparagus was as limp as canned asparagus. In short nothing in this dish ""married"" into any flavor. Therefore it was nearly inedible for me. Stupidly I did not send the dish back.

I travel to this area often for business and suggested to my coworker that we check out JP's based on rave reviews.  We asked a few of the employees at the hotel we stay at about it and they had never heard of it.  I pushed to check it out anyway.

Cuisine is Italian and their specials list is extensive and basically an entire separate menu.  Everything sounded salivatingly delicious.  Our server was very knowledgeable concerning the various dishes and was able to describe them in compelling ways.  So, it took us a while to decide.  After we had addictive warm bread with dill butter, we started with some salads.  The caprese salad was simple, fresh and all around amazing.  For my entree, I had an excellent seafood marinara fra diavolo.  It consisted of shrimp, scallops and other seafood on fresh linguine and covered in a delicious and perfectly spicy sauce.  Needless to say, I demolished it.  My coworker got blackened swordfish, which came out with a large array of colorful vegetables.  He also raved about his selection.  The food in general is nothing too adventurous, but it is all so well crafted and thoughtful.  Entrees are about $20 on average.

The drink selection seems well curated, there is a full bar and quite a few interesting special cocktails.  Quality wines and a good selection of local beers are available.

Atmosphere is also simple, with a kitchen separated from the dining room by a half-wall.  The lighting is low and there is an intimate feeling.  The service was good and the waiter, as I mentioned before, seemed very passionate and knowledgeable about the food itself.

Overall, we love this place! It's walking distance from our house and accomodates both our toddler and the palate quirks of both sides of our family (when they visit). I have a hard time ordering anything other than the steak, as they do such a good job of blue rare - going so far as to bring the sauce on the side so it doesn't cook the meat further (their idea, which I found to be very thoughtful). The salads are lovely. The menu isn't that impressive and seems really limited until you realize their specials menu is easily longer than their printed menu. If you catch them on a night when they have coconut cream pie, it's pretty darn decent and worth the calories. The staff is usually very friendly and remembers people, even if you only make it in once every few months.

Thrilled I persisted as dining experience for 3 of us was top-notch all-around. Hostess and wait staff (Terry) could not have been friendlier and more accommodating. Since hadn't been there since it was a different restaurant, didn't realize seating set-up or would have requested when making reservations not to be seated in bar at bistro tables. Hostess offered us outdoor seating instead which on 7/3 was delightful - much cooler than inside (one of the few nights w/o humidity). She easily turned what could have been an unpleasant situation into a positive and was so pleasant and professional about orchestrating the seating change. They were booked to capacity so we appreciated her efforts to satisfy us. Ended up being delightful outdoors on patio w 3 other tables. 

Terry, our waitress was fabulous. Don't know how she handled us all so efficiently and with a smile as everyone seemed to arrive at same time (also waited on inside tables). Appreciate Terry giving us her take on the many specials on the blackboard and describing ingredients and dishes to the tee. She really helped us make our decisions given it was our 1st time dining at JP's. Who needs a regular menu will the huge array of specials. After we had our appetizers, salads, and entrees, it was obvious that there weren't any wrong choices to make as everything was so delicious, incredible, and attractively displayed. Portions are very generous and everything was as fresh as could be. Only problem was we were too full to have desert, but will keep that in mind for next visit. Hat's off to the chef for his inventive cuisine (ravioli special w rib meat was to die for as was everything else).

It's one of those places that has been on my list forever, that I drive by every single day, but somehow always forgot it as an option when deciding where to eat. 
This Sunday though, I knew I wanted to go to a late brunch somewhere nearby and decided to check if Woodford f&b did brunch- and they sure do! 
From the moment I walked in I was in love. The design is reminiscent of some of my other all time favorite places in Portland (Rose Foods and HiFi donuts) in that it's the perfect mix between vintage and clean, sleek modern elements. I love the booths, giant windows, beautiful wooden ceilings and the white ceramic deer heads (plus the cool golden deer heads at the bar). The environment was so welcoming and truly visually pleasing. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait, really felt like this is a place where locals just stroll in for good quality food and drink without the fuss of going downtown. 

The menu had a brunch prix fixe option for $22, which included bottomless coffee, a cocktail and a brunch entree. We jumped at this option and for the cocktails ended up unanimously choosing the Harvey Wallbanger which was SO good... and slightly dangerous because it tastes more of orange juice than vodka, which meant I had the challenge of remembering to pace myself.
We got the biscuits and sausage gravy, eggs Florentine and the dulce de leche bread pudding French toast. Every single bite of the very generous portion was pure heaven. The biscuits were light, fluffy and absolutely doused with a creamy gravy containing chunks of salty sausage and two sunny side up eggs. Breaking the yolks of those eggs and mixing that in with gravy was incredible. The eggs Florentine was also extremely creamy with a bechamel sauce that married the spinach and poached eggs in a glorious way. When you pair that with the soft focaccia bread that accompanied it- well let's just say there was nothing left to take home. 
To top all of this off was the French toast. Whatever you do, you HAVE to get this. It was both soft and crunchy with toppings like nuts, seeds and raisins that made it feel like it was just as good for your body as it was for your soul. With our food also came a couple bowls of fruit containing pineapple, grapefruit, blood orange and grapes- which added a nice fresh and healthy element to the meal, and made us feel less guilty indulging ourselves. 
My new mission, after having such a wonderful experience, is to become a regular who knows the waitstaff by name and they know mjne.

The space looked good, like some kind of futuristic diner.  The tables were clean and the booth we were seated at was comfortable.  Ordered the housemade apple cider and thyme soda - really good.
Dinner  oysters Rockefeller as an ap, the burger for me and steak and fries for the significant other.

The burger.  Not cooked to my requested medium rare but that is the way it goes... always.  Weirdly a bit burnt on the bottom.  The pickles were too much with the grilled onions bacon and cheese.  Too much sweet and vinegar with the char on the bottom.  The fries were crispy and thin... but who can eat two whole potatoes worth in one sitting?  

The other... steak and fries... ordered cooked medium and came out rare.   So tough it was like chewing gum.  I tried some but gave up on swallowing it.  Too bad that plate cost 24$.  At least the were enough fries to make a meal out of that.

All things considered, even if it's a short walk from my apartment I won't be back unless someone else is buying... well... probably not even then.

So, it had been probably at least 6 months since I had been to Woodford F&B. I know the food is great if not a little pricey for the location, but the only thing I can ever remember about the menu is the burger. It's a damn good burger, but it is rich even on the burger spectrum and sometimes I don't want to feel over-full for 3-4 hours. Some errand brought us out this way (okay, maybe the errand was just going to Allagash but I digress), and my girlfriend was pushing hard for a lunch stop at WF&B. We did a drive-by to see there were bar seats open and then utilized the parking over at the Woodfords Club.

It's a Sunday. I'm kind of feeling like I could house that burger and then just lay somewhere all day, or maybe something else equally rich, of which there were a plethora of options. Then some voice that's rarely heard guided me to their cobb salad. A cobb salad typically doesn't generate too much excitement at least if you picture the garden variety (pun not intended), but this one is something else. First awesome thing: Smoked ham AND bacon, along with avocado. You still get the hard boiled egg, tomato, and some scallion and ""young greens"". I could honestly not tell you the difference between young greens and middle-aged greens, but this was a professional salad. An underrated component is when they actually toss the greens in the dressing before adding the rest and serving. Every bite has their buttermilk blue cheese in it, but it's also not overwhelming. Posting a photo, and I think it's one pretty looking salad. 

I guess the point is that we visit WF&B so infrequently that I forgot they can take something as simple as a cobb salad and make it into beautiful and super satisfying meal.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

On a whim I invited my dad out for dinner and there was absolutely no parking at our first choice so having never been here, we both decided to try this place. Yelp has this Mark is three dollar signs for a reason! The cocktail I got was $15 on its own! So if you're going here the idea has to be that you want to treat yourself!

Dad got the mussels and Fries while I got the tri-tip steak and fries. We started by sharing the caramelized onion dip which was divine! It comes with house-made rosemary potato chips and they're certainly more dip than chip. However, having noticed we finished the chips, the waitress offered to have more brought out for free! More chips were brought and the dip was finished I actually use my finger to clean the bowl!

My dad simply loved the mussels and fries going so far as to ask for a second piece of bread to help soak up the liquor at the bottom of the dish before giving it a good Italian slurp! My tri-tip steak and fries we're very respectable. The waitress asked how I would like the steak and I told her medium rare, however the steak ended up medium well. A minor thing and not worth having a fit over, so I simply informed her so that they could know it's something to be aware of. I didn't ask for anything in compensation or a replacement meal, the waitress did offer though.

The unsweetened iced tea my dad had was given a free refill, though I don't know if that's policy or simply our experience. I only had the one cocktail but it was delicious and delightful. In the end I was offered something small on the house as an apology for the steak being inadvertently overcooked. I brought something home for my husband to try since he was babysitting while I was out.

That said, I don't drink alcohol so my options were the usual fare: housemade soda, Maine root soda, coffee, and tea. If you want to know if their alcohol beverage menu is good, you'll have to find a different review!

So let's get down to brass tacks: the food of Woodford Food & Beverage is simply good. I love when a menu is uncomplicated, with choices for all types of eaters but not so overwhelming you drown in the sea of options (a la The Cheesecake Factory). Woodford has options but not too many. It's well prepared and delicious.

Let's start with the Croque Madame! Get it. The béchamel sauce is decadent and there's a whole slice of ham steak in there--no weak deli meat for WF&B. Sunny side egg of perfection added creamy bliss to each bite. Side of herbed dressing covered greens was fine, but nothing overly special.

The burger though. The BURGER. What makes a great burger? Every single damn thing in and on the WF&B' burger. What is that cheese blend?! The brisket and ground beef blend of the beef patty is tender, juicy, and absolute heaven with every mouthful. The bun is awesome. Homemade pickle, fabulous! Each bite of the burger will send you into meat heaven. I have never had such a tender burger and I can't imagine the experience will ever be topped. 

For dessert, we ordered the lemon blueberry panna cotta. The lemon curd was just too overpowering. I mean, I love me some lemon curd in a big way but it masks the perfect vanilla panna cotta beneath. I wish it had been undressed--simple can be better. I would love to try many many of the listed desserts--there were so many delicious options.

First off, the place looks great. There was obviously a lot of attention to the decor and aesthetic of this place. 

I wanted to like this place more though. First off, the coffee was pretty bad. In Portland, that's home to such a great coffee scene, I wish there was more attention to the quality and taste. 

Overall the food was decent, not blown away but very creative dishes and lots of food selection. We ordered some oysters, brussel sprouts, a delicious bread pudding, and other more brunch oriented fare. 

My one gripe of this place was that the eggs Florentine were way over done. The eggs were supposed to be poached and they were served with basically hard boiled yolks. The other eggs were okay and runny as expected. 

I would still check out this place and maybe even go back for dinner. The tap list looked great and cocktails seemed tasty. Service was great and they even split up the check for our party.

I will start  by saying that despite the early hour we were warmly greeted and very well served by as friendly a bunch as you could ever meet.  This definitely enhanced the neighborhood vibe.

It's quite amazing that an attractive upscale bistro opened on such a hectic and wild intersection. There is a small parking lot but it's unclear if it's for the adjacent laundromat or the restaurant. There is ample parking at the Woodford's Club nearby or on side streets. 

The restaurant itself almost feels like a hip diner. The bar was completely full at 5 pm on a Saturday and on a Friday several weeks later. Four top booths line the windows while two tops fill the center of the restaurant. The thick window blinds almost make you forget where you are.

Service was the best aspect of my experience. Our server, who was the twin of Erlich from HBO's Silicon Valley, was exceptional. The menu has a solid variety and has a fixed special of the day. The Quahog Chowder on Thursdays and Braised Lamb Shank on Fridays look the most interesting. The back of the menu is comprised of ten fun cocktails and a variety of beer and wine. It's awesome that the wine is available in three sizes, and the prices are very reasonable.

The prices are not quite as reasonable, however, for the food. The cheeseburger is $16, which may be the highest price in Portland. Again, this a restaurant that is located on one of the worst intersections in the city. Sure, it's an upscale burger made of brisket with bacon and many toppings, but $16??? So, was it worth it? I'll never know, because I ordered it medium rare and it came medium well. The heaping pile of French fries (easily enough for two people) were great. 

The steak and fries ($22) was ordered medium and came well done. It was average, but at least the fries were excellent. The roast half chicken ($21) was well cooked and tasty, but could have used a true side. 

Woodford's has serious potential even in the first couple months. The atmosphere is fun, the drinks are great, the service is perfect and the menu is interesting.

First off - the service was impeccable. I arrived before my friend and checked in with the hostess who went out of her way to make sure that we found each other. 

The space is understated and inviting. As others have said, there is a retro-diner-goes-upscale feel to the design is lovely. My friend and I shared a large booth by the window so we had a great view of the hustle and bustle of the busy intersection where WF&B sits. 

The cocktail list was on the small side, but there were more than enough choices and something tells me that if you sit at the bar, the bartender would be able to whip you up anything your heart desires.

I had a long time to study the menu and that's why I'm so disappointed by my order. I was sure I was going to get the lamb special and at the last minute, I went for variety and ordered the beet salad, mussels and frites. They  were all fine - the mussel broth was a little bitter and the beet salad was more of a beet tartar but overall is was perfectly fine. My friend ordered well and I was jealous.

The service was very friendly, from the bar staff to the servers. Everyone had a smile and was very polite. We both ordered the steak and fries, medium. The steak was good, not great. I found myself dipping it in the aioli that was for the fries to give it some flavor and moist-ness(?). Fries were great and aioli was great. My friend really enjoyed his, he did ask for BBQ sauce. 

I would come back, probably wouldn't order the steak again though. Would totally try other things on the menu. Drinks were good and service was great, did like the ambience of the restaurant.

4919,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4919,2016-12-02,"I heard a lot of foodie comments about Woodfords. First, there is parking, a small on site lot and an adjacent parking permissible at the Woodford's Club, about 100 yards up the street.

This is the old 80's Valley's steak house. The vibe is dark retro 60's. I personally am not a fan of the decor, although I readily admit, I'm not their target demographic either. I found the atmosphere way to loud and dark for my taste. The menu wasn't readable without my cell phone spotlight. Equally, the server speaking wasn't audible, I couldn't hear a word she said. Again referencing the overall vibe, it's not in my comfort zone....I just didn't enjoy the vibe.

When I first try a restaurant, my choice is to split a few small plates to see if the chef has decent cooking chops and the appetizers match the quality, style, and taste of similar places. I will give it a mixed review here. More negative than positive. 

The deviled eggs, don't smirk, were probably the most distinct and tasteful thing that we ate. Perfectly prepared, with a simple application of ground mustard, bacon, and smoked paprika, they were delicious. At $8....they aren't giving them away, but as a first course, two people get three halves each....and they were on point.

At $30 a dozen, the Damaroscotta oysters were ok....not close to Eventide in side accoutrements or, for my palate, in taste. I'd say they were average...at that price point, I expected better.

The duck mouse pate was decent....the portion was way too excessive for a shared appetizer....cut the price, and the portion size and they would have a better hit here. The pate was creamy, with toasted bread, grain mustard, and gherkins. This was probably the second best thing I sampled....but honestly, nowhere close to a good duck pate from the deli at Rosemont Market. 

Finally, we tried the steak tartare.....liked much more by my GF than I. I found the consistency way too bulky, almost a rough chop on the marinated raw tenderloin. The tartare did have a traditional raw egg yoke on top, that creates that oozing egg yumminess that steak tartare fans love.....This, unfortunately, didn't come anywhere in the ballpark of great local tartare at The Grill Room, or Timber...it just was semi flavorless, and bulky.

So that was our small plate try.....in sum, this is not a fine food establishment. I think if we came in, sat at the bar, had a microbrew and a burger, I'd probably be good with it.....but even there, the vibe and the decor, and overall loudness just isn't my cup of tea.

I'll pass on this spot.....2 1/2 stars.....in my foodie world",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4920,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4920,2018-03-09,"I really want to like WFB.  If I only went in to drink at the bar, I think I'd LOVE it.  Beautiful interior, great location, usually friendly staff.  But time and again, the food has failed me.  WFB falls into this unfortunate middle ground--the food is of a quality that it is more than just pub fare, but is priced as if it's fine dining.  The menu's pricing should be reduced by about a third on all items to make it reasonable for what's being served.

My last experience eating here made it likely I won't return to eat anytime soon.  A group of us were anticipating late dinner.  We made an online reservation for 8:45.  When we arrived at 8:45, we were told (I have to say in a  not altogether friendly way) that the kitchen closed at 9 so we should get our orders in ASAP.  If the kitchen closes at 9, why is making a reservation anytime past 8:15 even an option?  It seems a rookie mistake to not have a reasonable buffer between reservable times and closing time.  We had made the reservation around noon, so it wasn't like we were a walk-in or a surprise.  The food was, as it always is, fine, just fine.  But the staff made us feel as if we were a guilty party, hovering around our table and verbally prompting us to make our choices quickly.  Again, I avoid at all costs being the walk-in ordering food five minutes before the kitchen closes, but if you're accepting my reservation, I expect to be treated like any other earlier customer.
Finally, when our bill came, because we were a party of 7, gratuity was added to our bill.  Usually not a problem to me, except no one told us that gratuity would be added; this was never explicitly stated before we dined.  And frankly, with the staff rushing us and trying to whip us out of the restaurant as fast as possible, the gratuity was higher than I would have liked to leave.

Finally, as noted in previous comments, WFB's water game is on point definitely to a fault.  I do not need someone leaning over my shoulder every four minutes to pick up the water pitcher and pour more into my glass.  Find the happy medium!

Go to WFB, drink, maybe have their fries, which are excellent.  But it's a splurge that I would much rather make at any number of other Portland establishments.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4921,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4921,2017-08-20,"We live in walking distance, and this remains one of our favorite spots in the area. Highly recommended. Came back here twice recently with friends in the past few weeks, and my wife and I wandered in last Saturday before the dinner rush just for cheese and drinks at the bar. Service was, as always, impeccable -- the staff is very friendly, and really makes you feel comfortable. 

The drink selection remains fantastic, and the house-made sodas & shrubs are good enough to get with or without alcohol (even if you're of drinking age). If you can't make up your mind, both the waitstaff and the barstaff are highly knowledgeable and will be able to make good recommendations tailored to your specific tastes.

The food remains excellent, and certainly seems a good value compared with some other Portland-area restaurants. Portions are sized appropriately, not so small that you remain hungry, but not so large that you're overstuffed if you try a few things. Most recently, I had the steak-frites plate -- perfectly prepared strip steak, good seasoned fries (just salt & pepper, maybe some light batter?), and horseradish sauce. There were a few fries left, but not enough to pack up. On the other hand, my wife had the roast chicken and took at least half of hers home at the end of the night. Both were preceded by the mushroom tartine and the brussel sprouts (split four ways, between us and our friends) and all four of us were too full for dessert by the end.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4922,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4922,2016-09-21,"I really did like Woodford when they first opened, but... I don't know anymore. I'm not sure that it's become/is becoming the go-to neighborhood spot everyone had touted it would be (speaking as someone who can actually walk here). Now that its had time to settle in and go through a local's season to tourist season back to a local's season, I'm just not as besotted as I initially thought I was.

What I still love:
+ The cocktails. Competitive prices for Portland standards and they're really, really well crafted. From speciality drinks to simple martinis, every cocktails I've tried from here has been delicious, refreshing, balanced, and worth it. 
+ The space. I had originally described it as having a ""monochromatic-1950's diner-sans kitsch-stark without being sterile-feel"", which was cool and different for Portland. I still dig it. 

What I'm no so sure of anymore:
- The food. Small portions, big prices, and it's all just okay. It seems they run out things quickly, and the vegetarian options are uninspired and unmemorable. Again maybe this is just one of those awesome places in town that's much better for people without dietary restrictions, so maybe just ignore me (I won't be offended!) and go eat the burger here - I've heard it's the best in the city!
- The service. It's not bad, it's just... all over the place. At our latest trip here, while we had our water glasses refilled probably close to twenty times (no joke), the various people coming to our tables and relaying information to one another caused errors in our orders. We were wholly forgotten about at one point (minus the swooping in to fill our water glasses without a word) and then made to feel bad when we wanted to order food. And - despite asking for a specific kind of vodka for my martini - they decided to make all the martinis at the table with the same kind and charge us all the same price. That's not cool, is it? 

I think this is one of those places that's got two personalities: the one at the bar is much different then the one on the floor.

4924,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4924,2016-08-11,"Woodford Food & Beverage is a spectacular addition to Woodford's Corner. First, the bartenders are the absolute best - friendly, fun, knowledgeable, and talented. I'm always happy with their cocktails and their recommendations of which wine(s) to try. I'm still dreaming about the mojito I had a few weeks ago. Also, it's a bonus that you can get carafes/ half carafes of wine. They have a small, but good selection of beers.

Next, the food. My goodness.

Mussels [& fries]: The best I've ever had. The mussels, which on all 3 occasions I've had them, hailed from Calendar Island in Casco Bay. The broth is amazing - not overly buttery or fancy. To me, when it comes to seafood, simplicity is always best and Woodford F&B certainly delivers! On one occasion, I saw two women using the mussel shells to scoop up the remaining broth. While you could go that route, I would just get some extra bread!

Pate - It's always different. We've tried salmon, chicken, and duck. The salmon was by far my favorite, but they were all great! In fact, one of my friends who swore she didn't like duck and pate - was scooping up the last bites.

Caramelized Onion Dip / Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts - YUM. 

The Burger - Yes, it is a $16 burger. To me, it was very worth it. The brisket just melted in my mouth! Normally, I would be pretty upset with the soggy bun, but I'm pretty sure that's because I let it sit on my plate for a few minutes (too busy chatting).  It also comes with a TON of french fries.

Desserts - The strawberry rhubarb dessert with ice cream is just perfect in my book.

Overall, I just love this restaurant even when my bank account doesn't. I would recommend going to happy hour (5-6pm on weekdays, not sure about the weekend).

Woodford F&B has struck gold!  In an ex-car-dealership, in a somewhat drab and busy corner, is a gem.  The menu is impressive and dynamic, with both well-known and eccentric flavors.  The burger is the best burger I've ever had, period.  Ever.  And the fries are haunting my dreams.  I had pickled veggies, including tomatoes, as a complimentary appetizer.  So good!  Plus a great wine pour, which is always a bonus.

Also amazing is how you can go get oysters, foie gras, tuna nicoise, and steak tartar one night, but burgers and fries another.  Everything I've had here has been exceptional.  

And finally, it's a great restaurant off the peninsula.  I know there are others, but they're few and far between.  I don't have to drive all the way downtown to get some exceptional food, and for that I'm SO thankful.

The meat was just OK, but basically the equivalent of my SAT scores: dead average. 

The music was nice (I like to see a hostess gettin her groove on), and I give it to the service; everyone is friendly. Yet, I think the highlight for our dining experience was making sure that we finished our bottle of wine. The server seemed somewhat surprised that just the two of us were going to finish it, and he also offered a ""take home"" option.

First, I regret not writing this review a couple of months ago when I visited.  I had remembered, however, to jot down the name and what I ate in my iPhone notes.  We had ordered the filet mignon which was being featured that evening.  The server, about 10 minutes later came back out to the table and apologized that they had run out of it.  She suggested the tri-tip to be served similarly and I thought that sounded like a great idea.  Unfortunately, it was so totally chewy and raw it was barely edible.  My husband and I were having such a good time and the staff was just so nice - I didn't have the heart to say anything which I regret.  Please, do not substitute tri-tip for filet.  I mean, everyone knows they are two totally different cuts of meat but don't promote it as great.  Tri tip, in order for it to be tender must not be served rare because it is chewy and tough.

First off, the interior of the restaurant is really nice.  It has a hip, retro feel to it with a number of large booths that I find appealing.  The wait staff is also engaging, helpful, and down-to-earth.

The first few times I came here I was a bit skeptical because, in terms of food, the vegetarian options are pretty meager.  The one vegetarian entrée is called ""vegetables and grains,"" which is possibly the blandest name of a dish I have ever come across at a restaurant.  Nevertheless, it's tastier than I expected.  They also have really good shoe-string french fries that rank up there with the best in Portland.

In lieu of dinner, however, I recommend coming here for cocktails and dessert.  They may have my favorite cocktails in town.  They're tasty, well-balanced, and elegantly presented.  I also found their desserts to be sweet and delicious.

Overall, the combination of the nice ambiance, quality wait staff, and excellent cocktails and desserts give this place the edge even if their food options are somewhat disappointing.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

Five star service.

Their sound track had some CCR, so obviously this place is rad just from that fact alone.  

  Tar Tar was a hefty portion, even more so for a ""small"" portion.  Little on the peppery side, but still enjoyable.  Bread it came with was a great vessel to transport to my feeding hole.  Mussels were large, tasty and cooked in a lovely sauce.  The fries the mussels came with, holy molly, those things are dang good!  

Flounder was lovely, perfectly cooked served on a bed of rice, with a veggie and delicious sauce.  The burger, well reminded me of a Burger King rodeo burger... in an EPIC way.   Cooked a lovely medium, the thing gets a big thumbs up from me.  

Complementary cookies, well I wouldn't be pleased if I had to pay for them.  I wouldn't say they sucked, but in comparison to all the other lovely things I placed in my gut that evening, the cookies weren't great at all.

The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  

This 1970's style diner features an eclectic selection of dishes prepared with an earthy Mediterranean flare.  We started out with the beet salad and the savory duck pate.  Then the four of us each chose a different entree.  Dad enjoyed his burger, which has received many raves.  Mom's maple glazed pork chop was excellent, thick and juicy, with a smoky wood-grilled flavor.  I loved the creamy yogurt sauce and the sumac dry rub on my roast chicken.

We have only two complaints.  My husband's quahog chowder was pretty paltry for seventeen bucks.  A half-dozen clams were arranged in a puddle of thin broth along with some cubed potatoes.  This was supposed to be an entree.  It wasn't.

The other problem with this charming place is the noise.  The cheerful chatter mixes with the music from the bar and bounces off the high ceiling, making it almost impossible to converse.  Perhaps some carpeting would help?

Despite these two little glitches, I'm grateful to Woodford F & B for being an oasis of taste and civility amid the craziness of Portland on a Saturday night.  We'll definitely be back for those pork chops!",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

The fries that come with it are really good too! Not my favorite fries, they are a little bit too thin maybe, and with the outside crust emphasized a bit too much for my taste. But they are covered in a fantastic Chinese five spicy kinda seasoning that more than makes up for their shortcomings. Also you get about 10,000 of them on the plate. The fries also come with the steak frites which is exactly the dependable classic that you want it to be. 

Which is pretty much the story at Woodford in general.There aren't any big surprises, it's got a classic, timeless French brasserie kinda vibe, that managers to still feel fresh and contemporary. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the Sunday night special, Croque Madame. Once again, it plays it totally by the book and delivers. And it come with a nice big salad. Which is good because if your dining companion is smart their dish will come with a pile of fries and you can share both!",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

The service was on point, our waitress was attentive, knew the specials, and was able to answer our questions about the menu items. Additionally, other waitstaff stopped at our table a couple of times to ask if we needed anything. As a matter of fact, all of the Woodford staff were extremely hospitable and gracious.

The Food:

We had the deep-fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer, the leaves having mostly separated from the heads, arrived with the texture of the charred pages of a novel.  While they retained a pleasant flavor and the accompanying sauce was complimentary, the airy consistency made for an awkward dance on the palate. Both Tiqa and Boda excel in their preparation of this trendy micro- cabbage, Woodford should take note.  I should mention that the portion is sizable, and despite the awkward dance, we finished them.

I had the whole grain risotto, it was the best I have ever tasted.  It was full of grains, wheat berries, farro etc., and mascarpone, it was as moist and creamy as anything I have ever put in my mouth.  Cooked to perfection.

He had the braised lamb shank special.  It was meaty and delicious, and it took everything he had to not pick up the bone to gnaw at the remaining juicy slivers of stringy sinew.  

We also shared a crusty apple crisp-ish dessert with ice cream.  It, too, was delicious.  The dessert to ice cream ratio was spot on, and, again, the overall portion size was, well, it was HUGE, and that's not something I say often.

We liked the atmosphere, the floor to ceiling ceramic tile, the diner tables, and the not quite finished floor...totally felt like a neighborhood joint, no pretension, just great food at reasonable prices.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

Creative cocktail menu, curated beer and wine selection, and daily drink specials.  The menu is creative, but I wish there were a few more dishes.  The weekly specials looked great, but only salmon was available the day I came; not my favorite.  I would have loved to try the skate wing (or any other day's special), but to no avail.  Maybe next time.  Also, every dish seems to have an ""aioli.""  Perhaps the chef needs to scrap that idea, and focus on creating lighter, more modern sauce versions (just a suggestion).  Brussels sprouts as a starter were incredible, with a crisp smoky flavor we loved.  Cheese selection (of one) was tasty, but it was only one cheese; would prefer three smaller portions instead of just one.  For Main courses, we had the salmon special (simply prepared, for my son), the steak frites, and the pork chop.  Salmon was undercooked; I'm not a fan of the ""rare"" salmon.  Should be cooked fully or almost fully.  Not to our liking.  Pork Chop was the table hit; thick, juicy and spiced just right.  Steak frites was also above average; medium rare sliced steak over a horseradish cream.  Fries were crispy and tasty.  Service was professional if a bit too stiff.

I'll wait for the next owner before going back. The space is very nice, but they come off as a bunch of kids on trust funds that think they can throw anything on a place and charge $25.00 for it.

They start with the pre-coated,  frozen variety, which tend to crisp up better than fresh cut, twice- cooked, raw potato version. And it is that crispness, plus their proprietary seasoning,  and the perfect  aioli that make these the tastiest fries I've ever eaten - period. The fries alone make this place worth a visit. 

The rest of the menu is an eclectic mix of classic bistro fare and comfort food with a few American staples mixed in. The entree menu is abbreviated (2 beef, 1 pork, 1 fish, 1 chicken, 1 veggie entree).  A broader selection of appetizers, some salads, and a burger round out the menu, with a list of daily specials adding diversity. There is an adventurous cocktail, wine and craft beer menu with something for all palates, and a kids menu too - often a plus for us. 

The building is a converted space, a former Valle's steakhouse. And while the tables and settings were neat and clean, the hard floor to ceiling surfaces made for somewhat noisy environs.  The plain walls and decor lacked visual interest, offset by a few retro architectural details like the pitched bead-board ceiling.  Hand written signs on office paper taped to doors & windows are an eyesore, belying quality elsewhere.   An interior designer could easily spruce up some of these defects pretty easily. 

Service was friendly, knowledgeable, prompt and attentive, but uneven at times. No major flaws, just a bit choppy in communication and execution. 

The oysters, pate, mussels w frites were mostly well executed -  the baguette was overly tough, and the meunière a bit too garlicky and needing a tad more butter and a green herb. The mussels were just slightly past done, making them a little chewy, and the pate improved as it warmed to room temp. 

But the fries.  Oh the fries.   Go for the fries.   We'll be back to test this place out few times before giving a final verdict.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

So fresh and so tasty! My Boo got the Tennessee ham. He is from Tennessee and it made me happy when he said ' this reminds me of what my papaw used to cook'. It was beyond cool that the dish took him back in time. But that's how awesome this place is. Our waitress told us that the owner is a freak about researching ham and is determined the find the best. This kinda passion definitely shines through in the restaurant. 
For the main dish I got the Casio Bay Flounder and OMG. I can confidently say it was the BEST dish I have ever had. So perfectly cooked and put together. Every single bit was melting in my mouth. I was in disbelief each time I took a bite. My Boo got the steak and fries and he was thoroughly enjoying the meal as well, however he wanted mine more once he got a bite.

I'd personally give the food a 3/5, based on what we ordered, which was the Burger, Croque Madame (w/o the egg), and mussels. I had the mussels. The Burger (which is the menu name) was AMAZING - soft, juicy, and flavorful. However, it was a grease trap and sent oil running down my brother's hands when he ate it. The Croque Madame has excellent sauce and garnishing, and the cheesy topping was delicious. The meat, a slice of ham, wasn't as impressive, but overall decent meal. Lastly, I would not recommend the mussels. They were worse than the ones you can buy at the store and boil for half the price. I'd say they were severely underseasoned. But the ambience and the service make up for the food. Our waitress was warm and accommodating. They even included a pretty postcard of the restaurant at the end of the meal.

To start with, these guys have some of the best cocktails in town hands down. I arrived close to closing time, but the bartender (Miranda) was very friendly and talkative. I ordered the pork chop, but unfortunately there seemed to be a communication breakdown in the kitchen and it took over 20 minutes for them to prepare it even though there was hardly anybody else in the restaurant. A man who I later realized was either the manager or the owner brought my meal to me and apologized for the wait, but when I cut into it I could see that it was not cooked all the way through. Miranda took it away without a second question and apologized, saying she would comp my drink. At that point I ordered a second cocktail  and tried to be patient, but the second try took the kitchen almost 15 minutes, so at that point I was getting pretty impatient and probably visibly irritated. Again, the owner/manager dude brought my plate out and apologized wholeheartedly. As I ate my meal I couldn't deny that it was delicious, and when I finally asked for the check Miranda had taken about $30 off my bill. I was blown away, and instantly the frustration from the long wait disappeared. To make it even better, the owner/manager dude then came over with a bottle of Fernet and we took shots together. I have worked many years in the restaurant industry and I can't remember a time when a manager has shown such a genuine interest in making up for a kitchen staff's mistake, which happens from time to time no matter how nice the restaurant might be.

This place has it all - great food, amazing community oriented vibe, awesome interior, owners that are ready and willing to put in the labor and the love to grow an awesome locals spot.... and it's hopefully the anchor for the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  So, to elaborate on each of those topics... 
Food - I had the daily fish.  It was pollock the night I went - not always a fish I gravitate to because I feel like it's easy to overcook - no such trouble at WFB.  It was perfectly cooked on a bed of greens and wheat berries.  The deep-fried brussels sprouts were addictively crispy/savory.  Husband had the chicken... comfort food at its finest.  And a good kid's menu to boot.  Friends at a nearby table were raving about the burger and mussels and fries.  The menu features a handful of favorites, and a ""plat du jour"" section.  The theme seems to be a combination of rich comfort food, super well executed pub classics, and a smattering of ingenious and unexpected details.
Vibe - Well, we showed up at 5 cause that's when our kids get hungry... the place was full within 45 minutes of good-restaurant-starved Deering Center peeps.  Seriously, everyone I know in the neighborhood has been saying, for years, that we need a restaurant with great food and a great vibe to be the gathering spot.  This is it.  
Interior - Husband and I both remarked on how cool the windows and blinds were.  To be honest, blinds are not something I would normally notice, let alone comment on.  But these things somehow transformed the ridiculous Forest Ave snarl of headlights into.... mood lighting.  We also loved the diner style booth seating.
Owners - one of the owners, Birch, came by and said introduced himself.  It's clear this is a labor of love and he and his wife are in it for the long haul.  They're invested in this neighborhood and we couldn't be happier to have them.
 So, mark my words, this is more than a new restaurant... it's a spot for the neighborhood to gather at... it's the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  But the food and vibe is good enough to draw you guys from the peninsula.  Don't worry, there's parking for you at the Woodford's Club.

I don't often say that food is bad or gross, I might say ""okay"" or ""not very good,"" but this was seriously unpleasant to eat. My friend had some sort of tuna and avocado tartar which was essentially flavorless. On top of a disappointing meal the bill was outrageous: two beers and two small appetizers totaled $45!

The polenta fritters, blue cheese toast with garlicky spinach, and Turkish feta dip were some of my faves!

None of those are on the menu anymore.

And their Wine Time is now $5 for a glass.

For me, that's just not nearly as appealing as it used to be, especially considering other places in town (who essentially copied Blue Spoon's original amazing happy hour) are *still* offering $3 glasses of wine and discounted eats during HH. And there seems to have been a pretty substantial change to their menu over the years; I've been back for both brunch and lunch, and I'm not really inspired by the offerings.

I don't know, it always looked so crowded and filled with wealthy locals and tourists, and not like a place I would come to love.  I was really wrong.

After four trips this summer, I now know that Blue Spoon is a very comfortable restaurant with an excellent and friendly staff, that serves consistently delicious and interesting dishes.

The first time I visited was at lunchtime.  We started with the 3 spread app, which was wonderful.  I ordered a polenta dish for my main, which turned out to be far more delicious than I had imagined AND inspired me to add polenta dishes to our dinners at home!  Since then I have tried many things on their menu.  The mussels are delicious and they excel at fish dishes.

I also want to take a moment to give a sincere shout out to their desserts.  Often there might be only 2 or three offered, BUT they are consistently incredible!!  The flan is a standout, so much so, that you might want to ask if they have any when you begin to order and ask them to set aside one for you in advance.

The new owners have violated the first and most important rule of taking over a popular restaurant - Rule 1: do not change the menu for the first several months.  

I have to assume that this was due to the new owners being neophytes. Portland Maine is no place to learn how to run a restaurant.  Very sad.

5681,LrxS3HbauzYhashsTB5vPw,blue-spoon,5681,2018-07-21,"This was the best meal we had in Portland. Here is why:

1. Vibe. 
I'm no restaurant owner or chef but something about The Spoon and it's staff gives off this really laid back, kind vibe. We went there with our almost one year old feeling overheated and a bit overwhelmed. As soon as we sat down in there, our mood shifted. It finally felt like we were on vacation.

2. Dishes that showcase creativity, thoughtfulness, and fresh ingredients. We went to Duckfat per friends' recommendation and while the food was delicious, it was super heavy and strong (fat and salt). I felt like the ingredients were sort of masquerading in disguise because the richness of the dressing/seasoning that overwhelmed the ingredients.

The Spoon was refreshingly different. It reminded me of our time in The Bay Area. Fresh ingredients perfectly seasoned and made slightly rich by a thoughtful, not excessive amount of fat. You get to really enjoy the true flavors of the produce and the creative combinations of the chef. As I told my partner-if I lived here, I'd come here every week.

3. The drinks we're fantastic. Spicy ginger beer. Perfectly balanced Sazerac. What more could tired parents ask for.

4. A great place for kids. We're not ones to expect folks to bend over backwards for our one year old. However kids are extremely inconvenient and I really appreciate it when people are helpful and kind. Our waiter gave us a tea kettle for a warm bottle. They gave us a place to put our stroller. They put things on the table so our kid couldn't reach it and make a total mess. These small things really make a difference to parents. Thank you The Spoon.

Will be recommending The Spoon hard core to all our friends and family.

Service - 1 star & Incredibly disappointing and rather insulting 

If you arrive here on a Saturday night an hour before closing (8:15pm),  even if the place is NOT full, let me tell you right now, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE...

Unless you enjoy waiting over an hour for the first bite of your food, cannot order multiple menu items because they ""ran out"", not receive any service or water for 30 minutes after you are seated because they ""are short on glasses"", not have your order put in the system for at least 30 minutes after you ordered, AND get charged full price for a an appetizer that shrunk in size because they ""ran out"" without telling you upfront. 

If I were the owner of this business, I would recommend my diners come back another night if I knew my restaurant wasn't able to deliver our best that night. Although there were multiple things that ""went wrong"", there were two that stood out to me as REALLY needing to be fixed. 

(1) Over 30 minutes AFTER the waiter took our orders, he came back to our table and wanted to reconfirm the 3 items ordered. Unfortunately, he got part of the order wrong, but we corrected it. The question is...What happened to the paper you wrote everything down on over 30 minutes ago?? Better yet, why wasn't this entered into the system 30 minutes ago when you took our order? We ended up waiting over an hour for the first bite of food to arrive. 

(2) We had ordered a large mussel appetizer. When our plate arrived, I was SHOCKED at how small the plate was with zero explanation from the waitstaff. (I had done my yelp research and browsed pictures) We had to ask, ""is this this large size??"" Our waiter unapolagetically replied, ""No, this is all we had left"", and left without an apology.   

SERIOUSLY. If this is the case, you should have the taken the time to at least explain to your diners BEFORE putting in the order that you were out of mussels. Or, when you were presenting it to the table, apologized for the shrunken size, and then perhaps wrote it off the final check. Instead, they charged us for it ANYWAY! 

With all the things that went wrong, our waiter did at two points ask if he could get a drink for us or a dessert ""on him"". We declined both options because they simply were not items we ever ordered. We are not big drinkers and not big on dessert. Also, he offered the drink while we were VERY empty stomached and had been waiting an hour at that point for our first bite of food. 

Let me clarify, our waiter was at no point rude to us. However, as diners, we felt we received inferior and unprofessional service. Even though the flavor of the food was great, this restaurant obviously needs to get their service act together. This has been THE Most disappointing dining experience I've had in the 2 years I've lived in Maine. Management, PLEASE get on this. 
  
FOOD:
I can't say enough wonderful things about the chef. The 3 dishes we ordered had excellent flavor and balance. Price was reasonable. ~$70 before tax for the 3 below. 

- Mussels: If you are lucky enough to not get the last few mussels of the night (which we did), you will love the flavor of these. The flavor of the broth is light, not too buttery, garlicy, and bright. Mussels were fresh and sweet, just like I like them. Toasted bread on top was crisp and perfect for dipping. 

- Steak entree: Cooked to perfection, this piece of meat and the sauce it came in was decadent and bold. Really delicious if you're looking for something meaty and more on the heavy side. 

- Pollock entree: Fish was tender and flaky. Excellent green sauce on top made the fish pop. Came atop a bed of fingerling potatoes, which were cooked a hair on the raw side so it maintained a bit of crunch. Great option if you're looking for something on the lighter side. 

The service ruined our experience at Blue Spoon. Hopefully, you'll have better luck.",4.0,2,"['89 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.66686,-70.24687,"American (New), Mediterranean, Tapas/Small Plates, "

Booked an 8:45 pm reservation thru Open Table a week or so ago

Arrived 10 minutes late - apologies (I flew in from Charlotte and it took a bit to drop my bag at the WONDERFUL Press Hotel before heading up Munjoy Hill w/my wife and friend)

Katie won't seat us; according to her watch it's 9:00 and the kitchen is closing PLUS 

She:  ""You didn't book with us, we didn't take your reservation.""

Me:  ""Well, we booked thru Open Table, the reservation system you use and thru which you set the times when you will accept reservations....""

She (annoyed):  ""That's different, you didn't book with us.""

Me:  ""Well, we'd love to be seated and have dinner.  My daughter and I enjoyed lunch here last summer and there seems to be plenty of seats open.""

It was down the street from our Airbnb so we walked and upon walking in you see how teeny tiny it is inside which we loved. People had just gotten up from the bar and the servers told us we could grab the bar or a table and we picked bar. The bartender Jason ( I believe that was his name ) was fabulous. He was so personable and funny - not to mention he wasn't over barring or too distant like some bartenders. He was seriously lovely. We started off with the mussels which were probably some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend got a Manhattan and said it was spectacular ( he's a bartender himself so he can be picky haha ). We also got some soft sourdough bread and oil which paired so well with the leftover broth. 

I had the steak salad with roasted veggies which was cooked to perfection ( med rare is the way to go people!!). Jason answered all my questions and actually seemed excited to answer them. My boyfriend got the burger that came with a potato salad that was dressed in dijon ( amazing ). All the servers were smiling and lovely and the kitchen staff was great as well.

The house specialty drinks although pricey are excellent.  We also ordered a bottle of wine. Although the list is small the pricing is excellent. They even had a bottle for $21. Where do u see that??  We had a $30 which was excellent. 

The entrees were top notch. I had the rib eye which was perfectly cooked and simply mouthwatering. The herb butter on top just sent this great piece of meat over the top. My wife and son had the flounder. They could not stop raving or eating it. It was so good neither offered me a taste. 

Topped it all off with a wonderful lemon blueberry cake. Perfect light ending for a great dinner. The homemade whip cream on the top was perfect. 

My only hesitation on giving 5 stars was the service was a little lax. I was ok with it because I think they want it to b a dining experience. My wife and son thought it a little slow.

Friendly staff greeted us immediately for Saturday morning brunch. After sitting at our table, I found my fork was dirty. This, IMHO, does not bode well for the meal. I ordered the cornmeal pancakes with strawberry compote and maple yogurt drizzle. The pancakes were nothing special. They were fairly dry and crumbly. The drizzle was overpowered by the compote and I found myself adding maple syrup to get any maple flavor. My son had a breakfast sandwich that came with a side salad. I know breakfast salads can be a thing but this salad felt like an afterthought to make the plate look full. Just greens (fresh) dressed lightly with a vinaigrette (which was light and tasty) but felt confusing with a bagel breakfast sandwich. I was looking forward to another dish on their menu on their website but it appears they've changed their brunch menu. A note on the website might better prepare diners to expect possible changes. Our waitstaff person was attentive to start but almost seemed to ignore us at the end of our meal (there were only a few tables filled).

The waitress brought out 4 tiny pieces of bread for the 4 of us. The olive oil it came with was fantastic, wish we had more bread for sopping it up.

I had the beet and hazelnut salad with buttermilk ranch $13- which was good, had plenty of beets, but no creamy cheese to go with like I was expecting.

The food was very good.  We tried the mussels and a beet salad first.  Both were excellent, the mussels were in a somewhat traditional white wine sauce I believe and the beet salad was good, with big chunks of beets and a great dressing.  After that, we got the risotto and the bistro burger, with mushrooms.  Man that burger was good!  I'm not usually a burger guy for dinner, but I had heard good things.

It is a laid back small place On Congress just blocks from the Eastern Prom. It is nestled among the houses in the neighborhood which gives it a quaintness and some modern authenticity. The restaurant is known for local ingredients. And it was evident in all parts of our experience.   

First, the waiter was fun.  I wish I could remember his name.  We had an early reservation because we had our 8 year old and we walked in in shorts.  They didn't blink an eye and the waited chatted with us and our son like he wanted to know us...not just serve us.  

This gets a lot of attention fir wines that are well selected but as a beer nerd it's frankly something that is to die for if you are a beer traveller.  This small list of drafts:  Maine Beer Lunch and Peeper, Bissell Brothers Baby Genius, and one called Green Warden brewed with spruce.  I almost danced when he ran through this small list of world class drafts.

It's not a restaurant with a kids menu so know that your kiddo will eat what adults eat but the have a GREAT bistro burger that was reviewed by the NY Times.  And since it's bigger than a child can eat...I got to have some of it.  A top flight burger that you can dress with thick cured bacon and a Fred egg. It came with a Dijon based potato salad that was unreal.  They looked like breakfast potatoes made into this tangy smooth dressing with lots of herbs.  I'd have ordered it as a side for my entree.  Spectacular.

My wife had a fried polenta appetizer (with a fancier name) and a tomato sauce.  The only thing that was not fantastic...a bit too salty and plain.  I wanted beets and had a beet tapas dish with a horseradish sauce and pistachios.  Wonderful.  The creamy sauce gave them a spicy bite but did not overpower the beets.  The nuttiness came across perfect too.

My entree was a leap for me.  I ordered an encrusted Hake fish dish that came with a tomato jam, served over greens and celery with a spoon for an incredible broth.  It was among the best fish dishes I've ever had.  The flavors were perfect and complex.  It was a leap fir me because the rest of the menu includes a famous risotto, a ""from the braising pot daily ragu"" and a pork chop that had caught my eye. 

My wife had the ragu which featured pork belly.  Yes!!!  I got to try a bite and it was fabulous too. How can a pork belly ragu not be awesome?

We couldn't eat dessert.  The portions were excellent.  You can get half portions of some items too if you want salads or tapas.  In the end this was an experience I'd do again this week.

 Living in the neighborhood, we sometimes like to stop by in early afternoons for a drink and dinner. That said, it's become irritating to see 'reserved' signs on the three tables outside which are coveted spots in nice weather. Most restaurants with such limited seating have a first-come-first served policy.  - On one recent afternoon we'd finally had enough with feeling like we were begging to go here, so we went across the street. I sat and watched as those three 'reserved' tables remained empty for well over an hour.

If the owner or staff is going to hold tables for their friends, etc. (which may or may not be the case), at least have the courtesy to ask people to be on time.

I will never come home to Portland again for only 4 days- it simply was not enough time to eat everywhere I wanted to. Anyways, Blue Spoon, I love you so much. Reason being for dining here twice within such a short time though all comes down to the blue cheese garlic toast. See, I had been dreaming about this dish since fall of 2014 when I last had it before moving away. I came here for brunch on a Saturday, giddy and over the moon excited to eat my beloved dish. Well, the brunch menu on the weekend appears to be quite different than the regular lunch and dinner menus. It is super limited and not what I was expecting. Needless to say, I was hurt, but I would get over it, and still find delicious food to eat. I had the goat cheese toast to start. I am IN LOVE with goat cheese but I wasn't trying to replace my blue  cheese garlic toast. This was super scrum, came with two pieces with goat cheese, honey, and walnuts. Delicious. I then ordered the mussels because it was really one of the only things on the small brunch menu that appealed to me. I was cursing myself for coming too early, it's okay though, I WOULD be back. The mussels were plentiful in a roasted garlic broth. I do believe we had a coconut flan for dessert which was HEAVENLY. I am IN LOVE with flan and I am IN LOVE with coconut. I left, full, but satisfied, and ready to return promptly when they opened back up for dinner. 

So, I would like to state that I am OBSESSED beyond belief with the blue cheese garlic toast. It is in my TOP FIVE favorite dishes in the city of Portland. That says a lot if you know how many incredible things there are in Portland. I mean, this thing is OUTRAGEOUS. It makes me so sad that I won't be having it again for probably at least 6 months, but realistically much longer. At this point in the day, I was already full from the 2 meals I had had already and maybe a few margaritas and mimosas, BUT, that was NOT going to stop me from going back to get my blue cheese garlic toast. So I was very hung up on this, because it was my last day in town, there was no option of NOT going there. Back we go to Blue Spoon- and I think it was happy hour, they had wines and maybe a few beers on special. I was full, and we were going to dinner after this toast anyways. I really packed it in in these 4 days, I was so proud of myself- still am. Okay, BLUE CHEESE GARLIC TOAST. Please, please, PLEASE, if you come to this restaurant, PLEASE order this. I don't care if you don't even like blue cheese, or garlic, or toast, get this dish. It is truly one of THE best things I have ever had, EVER. It is just perfection. I don't even really know what else to say. I had been raving about it to my friend Blank forever, and she knows I know about good food, but even she was blown away. She said ""You're right Blank, it really is the best"". I mean, it just exceeds expectations. Also, we had some donut something orgasmic dish as well. It had feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, and some other jazz. I literally have no idea what it was, I do not believe it is on the menu, but it was RIDICULOUS GOOD. I wish I had a good memory. Anyways, it was incredible. So this was all we had because we had more eating to do, but please get the blue cheese garlic toast. 

Having said all this, I have been here a number of times in the past, and truly ever dish I have had here has been amazing. Their prices are extremely fair, the portions are great for yourself or sharing (DO NOT SHARE BLUE CHEESE TOAST), and they have a lot to choose from. I love coming here and ordering 8047 tapas.

We went here for a birthday dinner and seated ourselves outside as per waitress instruction and got our menus and bread, and we ordered.  This is where the good part of the evening ends.

The bread was a basic passable french bread with some olive oil and pepper.  It was something to eat.  The other waitress, however, brought the gentleman behind us fruit bread.  They have fruit bread!  And we weren't given or even offered any?  WTF?  I want fruit bread.

Speaking of the other waitress we saw her 11 times between when we place our order and when we got our one refill of water (about 30 minutes).  11 times. . .   When she finally reappeared she told us that we were up next and left the empty bread bucket and plates on the table.  No more bread for us.

15 more minutes pass and we're watching other people, even people who got seated after us getting served, but still no sign of our waitress.  Still, no more bread for us or even an explanation.

Finally almost an hour after we ordered our food showed up with a quick ""sorry"" and she disappeared.  At this point, I've apologized to the birthday girl at least three times and we'd considered just leaving and going to David's twice.  We should have-  No one would have noticed anyway.

The food was ok.  I ordered my steak medium and it was still tough.  The chicken under a brick was tasty and the polenta really made the dish.  Still, at this point we were both so hungry it barely mattered.

When we turned down dessert (normally I'd alert someone that it's a birthday but our waitress was nowhere to be seen and I never do it in front of the birthdayee) the girl hustled away from the table as quickly as she could forcing me to flag the other more attentive waitress to ask for the manager so we could talk about the service.  I found out that there's no manager,  just the owner.  Fine, please send him over.

A couple minutes later our waitress reappeared to let us know that the owner was in the kitchen had ""about four things going on and couldn't come out"" 

So the owner was too busy to talk to us about a bad experience on someone's birthday that, furthermore, left me embarrassed since I picked the restaurant.

As a twenty-something living in Portland with parents in a neighboring town, the three of us make an effort to go out to dinner together fairly regularly.  Our problem has been finding places that we all LOVE as we all have different preferences among Portland restaurants.  But we all went to The Blue Spoon Friday evening and as we left were already anticipating our return visit.  From the food, to the service, to the ambiance, it was a home run.  

The food was delicious, local, and fresh.  The pre-dinner ""snack"" menu was wonderful--I had the feta with honey and it was a new and surprisingly perfect combination.  I skipped out on the salad, but my mother had one that she reported to be quite good.  And when the main course arrived ...all three of us cleaned our plates.  I had a squash and pasta dish with a sage sauce that was superb. 

You have options with portion sizes both for salads and entrees.  I had the larger portion entree and it was very filling.  Had I had a salad or appetizer (aside from the feta ""snack"") I would likely opted for the smaller portion size.  I think the price range falls between Moderate and Spendy on the Yelp ranking, since with the various add-ons and drinks you can go over $30/person.  That said, you can enjoy a full meal for under $30/person if you don't splurge.

Our server was attentive and eager to please.  She was able to give wine recommendations based upon our orders.  All in all it was a fantastic meal.

Overall I was a bit let down of the dining experience, most likely its because I had been having lobster for days while at Acadia and was probably having a bit of a lobster fatigue haha.

It was quite a long wait when we arrived around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. Parking was a bit of a hassle after circling around Commerical street finally got lucky and parked at one of the few spots right in front of the building, definitely a very popular restaurant.

After about 15-20 minute wait we got a seat on the upper level which were quite empty only another table occupied other than ourselves. I guess they only open this area up when it gets very busy. I thought it was very nice though as it was quite quiet and second floor has its own bathrooms as well. Plus our server was quite friendly and pretty attentive given how empty it is up here. Not quite the diner atmosphere I was expecting indeed.

Unfortunately I was a little let down of the food. The chowder is a very big bowl portion but felt a bit bland and watered down. The Swiss melt feels mostly cheese and not quite balanced with crab meats. The lobster roll was definitely the better of the meal, the lobsters was quite fresh and delicious but honestly it fell short of what I've had all week while in Acadia.

I would take responsibility for making poor dinner choices, but have since learned my lesson -- NEVER order scallops from a diner. 

Stick to the sandwiches and burgers and maybe cake and you'll walk out happy. My friend polished off his crab melt in minutes. The waffle fries I had as a side were honestly some of the best I've had--well-seasoned, and crisp throughout. The blueberry cake was like a frosted blueberry muffin and looked beautiful. 

Everything else was mediocre. Again, it was my mistake to order scallops at a diner. The texture just seemed off--soft, squishy, bland, as if they'd been previously frozen--bleh. As part of the daily special, the scallops came with breading. I'd admit the breading had an interesting and palatable combination of sweet and salty that was pretty addicting. But overall, it was just too heavy and I would wager that the breading was thrown on to mask the poor quality of the scallops.

Their famous clam cakes were just as disappointing. These are really mis-labeled. There was hardly any clam in these, beyond a few specks of something whose chewy texture was akin to that of clam. Rather, these should really be marketed as breading with a hint of clam because that was what these were. I fail to see what makes these clam cakes famous and I'd urge you not to fall for the same trap.

This is a pretty big diner and they offer a lot of variety on their menu. What they have that I don't see much in New York is the seafood options they have and in particular the Lobster Rolls I was really looking forward to. They also have the classic ""Whoopie"" pies you can't find in normal NYC diners and they have some local Portland hot sauces.

The food here is great and mouth watering. The Lobster in my roll was fresh and tasted great with the butter they pair with it. Though its a little expensive they give you a good portion of french fries to go with it.

The atmosphere here is really chill and nice though its a bit crowded. You can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for just two people and it can be quite loud inside. The staff here is very friendly and they like to talk to tourists about the area of old port.

On a positive note, the diner is the real McCoy, and completely authentic. It's large, so can accommodate a lot of people, though if you miss that early-bird Sunday brunch window, which is some magical time between 11 and 11:30am, you'll end up waiting 20 minutes.

Clam chowder is SUPER creamy, and uniquely delish! I ordered a large bowl for the table, and it was devoured in minutes. It was the one standout of the entire meal.

The rest of the breakfast was ok. Pretty average. You have to pay extra for real maple syrup, or you're stuck with that high-fructose corn syrup crap. It's annoying, because what you do pay for is essentially a small tequila shot of maple syrup. Pancakes are otherwise pretty average.

I had the recommended special of lobster eggs Benedict, which was about as special as canned tuna. The hollandaise sauce they use tastes like bottom-shelf, which completely takes away from any lobster joy you look forward to. Nah. Just stick with regular Benedict (unless you have to pay extra for ""real"" hollandaise sauce too).

The service is great though. Several staff came by to check on our table, and they were the sweetest darlings. I'd come back for the service alone.

I got a Greek salad with lobster (no mayo) and a fried clam cake. The salad was large and the lettuce was crisp but the lobster portion was small and for $16 I could have just gotten a lobster roll from across the street. The lobster was also not brushed with butter or seasoned in anyway. The clam cake was thin and so battered that it just tasted like fried breadcrumbs. But for $3 bucks I can't say much about it. 

We also had a 20 minute wait and sat outside since there was no seating inside. The 2nd level seating was nice and in the shade but it was a hot day so it would have been nice to have had the option to sit inside.

I researched how to contact the owner directly via email; but, the website and the FB page both do not contain a direct message option. I feel badly posting this publicly, but after calling three times today in hopes of speaking to the owner (or at least a manager) and getting hung up on or disconnected, I want the owner to know about our experience. We were a party of 5 at 7 pm yesterday. Our server was prompt and took an interest in our table (I think his name was Jared). Our issues were with some of the food items, not the service - even though our server did not seem to know how to properly address our concerns. Our dinners were served in stages. Side dishes were served before entrees, each of our entrees were served separately, several minutes apart, and we were unable to eat as a family. My fries were served well ahead of my meal. I ordered a side of gravy to go with my fries and it was served lukewarm. I had to send it back twice because the kitchen continued to send out warm-ish gravy. My daughter's mashed potatoes wee cold, but she was so hungry, she ate them anyway (getting the attention of our server and sending stuff back seemed to take a while). The first bite of my stuffed scallops were delicious, although a bit sandy. My second bite was actually cold (cold, sandy, stuffed scallops are not appetizing, trust me!). As our server was taking our cold food items from the table, I looked down and noticed a big black curly hair wrapped around a piece of my 5 year old's broccoli. The kitchen eventually reheated my dinner and the second time it was served, it was piping hot. But, at this point, the shrimp in the stuffing were rendered inedible and the scallops were like rubberbands. I also bit into sand with each bite. I literally paid for, and did not eat, a stuffed scallop dinner. We laughed off our bad luck and assured Jared it was not his fault, but I will admit we were a bit surprised that no manager visited our table and we did not receive an apology. We did not ask for anything to be comped - and no offers were made.

I will say.. parking can be a bit of a buzzkill.. but trust me.. its all worth it if you manage to get a spot. We got there and waited about 5-10 minutes for a table given it was noon. I started off with a cup of haddock chowder and then moved on to the lobster roll meal. Imagine Shaggy from those classic Scooby Doo episodes scarfing down a mountain of food.. that was basically me with all of this. The chowder was great, and the roll with the side of fries and cole slaw hit the spot easily. The best part of this whole place is the dessert though.

The service is friendly and unpretentious.  The food is good with generous portions.  On this most recent visit we stopped in for a late lunch en route home after a vacation in Camden.
I ordered a cheeseburger which was so delicious.  Hamburgers fall into the category of deceptively simple foods....like omelettes. Simple fare but hard to get right.  A good to great hamburger requires starting with excellent quality beef, the correct ratio of fat to meat (so that the burger is juicy) and a deft hand on the grill.  Score for the burgers at Becky's!   There are several choices of cheese for a cheeseburger.  I chose the pepper jack and I loved every juicy, tender bite.
My husband had the special sandwich of the day which was a classic Reuben which he loved.
They offer their sandwich breads with gluten free options which is nice.
We each had a glass of a local craft beer called Gritty's.  It was a hot day and the beer, which was recommended by our waitress, was refreshing and light.

The rotating dessert case at the front of the restaurant is quite a marvel.  The case reminded me of my NYC days when every diner had one of these rotating wonders as a way to showcase the array of desserts.  Becky's has an amazing selection of beautiful looking cakes and other desserts.  We didn't partake of any but the selection was hard to resist.

It's an unassuming diner & nothing finer. Service was friendly, food was good, but not the best ever. Lobster roll was not bad, but definitely not the best. I don't know why they're listed as one of the best places to get a lobster roll. I did a lot of research & I should've just taken my friends elsewhere, but it was an experience. The clam strips were not bad, but I loved the onion rings the most. Yum! Cole slaw was not great. Just because it's a diner doesn't mean it has to have the standard boring cole slaw. I really think they can improve their dish without making it pretentious. Maybe a little more acidity would make it better. 

As for the lobster roll....well, the lobster is fresh since they have a tank of the lobsters in the restaurant. However, the roll itself is nothing fancy. It's really small & their mayo isn't homemade or original in its creation, it's just from a jar. Same goes for the butter. Becky's is A-OK. It really isn't the best, it's not the worst, but it's good. While the lobster roll itself is really small, the portions of the sides are huge. I felt full. I felt disgusted.

Decor: Not too kitschy, but more classic diner. Booths, counter, big hand warming mugs, cake and pie case, Maine waterfront artwork. Loved the crushed ceramic vases and curtains! Those are really neat. 

Food: We all had breakfast.

Instead, we stood around awkwardly, waiting for someone to notice us for a solid ten minutes. Then, when my girlfriend ordered a manhattan, she had to remind the server what she ordered TWICE, before having the bartender bring her the wrong drink. When she explained that she had ordered a manhattan, he tried to ""mansplain"" to her what a manhattan was and how that was similar to the drink be already had for her, despite it 1. Not being what she ordered and 2. Her telling him she had already tried that drink and didn't like it. Of all the restaurants I have been to in Portland, this was an incredibly disappointing way to celebrate my girlfriend's new job.

The menu changes frequently but generally contains delicious modern updates of traditional breakfast offerings such as: steak and eggs, or their version of a lobster egg Bennie called traitors eggs( perfectly poached lobster served on home made focaccia with hollandaise).  Absolutely delicious and approachable. Unlike some of their peers, you will never leave hungry. This is a place that you don't have to be a foodie to love. 

As quick note, dinner here is also excellent. I would say it has the best meat centric menu in the Portland area. You really can't go wrong with anything here. I would give it five stars but, it's a little to noisy for me at dinner.

6060,tTKTsa-HGWnbxKrLOgM1Tg,five-fifty-five,6060,2015-08-09,"Context: We were staying at our vacation rental above a restaurant called ""Five Fifty-Five"". Seeing that the restaurant RIGHT BELOW US had such high reviews on Yelp, we had to stop by and make reservations for dinner. Our 8:30PM reservation was made and we were wondering if the experience would exceed the wonderfully positive reviews on Yelp.

We were given a window seat (that allowed us to see the busyness of Congress Street) and took a quick look at the menu. What was most appealing to use was the Tasting Menu and the Chef's Tasting Menu (which had to be made by appointment at least 24 hours beforehand). After talking to the waiter, he recommended the Tasting Menu because it allowed us to pick one item out of the 5 categories on the menu itself. With the two of us, it would provide for a wider variety of plates to taste between the two of us. We were sold, along with the wine pairings for each dish. 

Here is how I'll start, my favorite dishes to the good dishes. 

 - Mussels: The last time I had really good mussels was when traveling around Brussels, Belgium, a few years ago. I so wanted these mussels to taste the same. The mussels came with a tomato-like sauce that went so well with meaty (yet tiny looking) mussels on my plate. I told my boyfriend that he had to try it along with a spoonful of the sauce (which is what really made the dish). Our waiter was taking away the dish and my bf was still trying to scoop out the leftover sauce. That was how good it was. 

- Lobster Mac and Cheese: I realize that many of the reviews for Five Fifty Five revolves around this dish. To be honest, there are MANY places in Portland, Maine, that sell Lobster Mac and Cheese. I'm sure we passed by over 20 places on the way to Portland, Maine that sold this dish. For $35, it better be so damn good Lobster Mac and Cheese and, damn it, it was. With shaving of black truffle on top with some truffle oil mixed into the cheese itself, it is the heartiest and fullest mac and cheese I have ever had. The lobster was fresh and I soaked that meat in the cheese before every bite. 

- Manchego cheese: Manchego cheese was fresh and creamy that went well with the marmalade. A nice break to the heaviness from the lobster mac and cheese and mussels. 

Our waiter was wonderful! He said that he usually isn't a waiter and works in the back but he was super helpful, courteous, and made sure that my water cup was full after so many glasses of wine. I'm glad that he didn't judge (or didn't seem like it) and shared with us some stories about his life. We gave him a nice tip for staying late to accommodate our experience. 

Overall: Let's just say that when my boyfriend and I were finishing up the final leg of our Maine and Boston trip, we were still talking about the dishes from this night (particularly the mussels) and have been looking forward to relive the experience the next time we are in Portland. When arriving back to California we started looking up restaurants that had some good mussels but have yet to find a place that has the quality and care of five Fifty Five. It is a tragic shame that we have to be so far apart, on opposite sides of the country, to have a love so strong. Until then, Five Fifty Five.",4.0,3,"['555 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65531158447271,-70.2621307373047,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), "

We were able to substitute them into the tasting menu, and devoured them. Our other selection- beef carpaccio was delicious, but no match for the mussels.

The lobster poached Mac and cheese with shaved truffles are all I still am thinking about a week later. So much so, I bought a Maine cookbook because i found the recipe included.

A $33 filet arrived over cooked and took 20 minutes to replace. When it came back none of the garnishments/sauces were included and the rest of my party was already basically done. Such a letdown. I'm glad they redid it without a hassle but the dissapointment was huge. We go there while on vacation probably once every 3-4 years and are in no hurry to return. Portland has become a first class dining City and Dimillos needs to step up their game to stay relevant.,3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

6084,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6084,2019-02-18,"I went here with a party of 10 for myself and my two brothers birthday. I had great expectations for this place, the location is right on the water and actually rocks you back and forth like a baby going to sleep. Unfortunately this is probably the best part of the entire restaurant. 

It was a Saturday night and our waitress was very nice, but the service was slow. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the entire dinner (I shit you not) took three hours. Yes it's seafood, yes it was a Saturday night, yes we had a party of ten. But that is just unacceptable, when the waitress brought our food, everyone had a piece of garlic bread on the side of their plate (nobody's good included it so I assume that was to make up for the wait). This was nice, and arguably one of the best garlic breads I've had. However here is the problem: For 27 dollars for a 12 ounce cut of prime rib, you would expect some sort of vegetable, bread, some seasoned garnish or something. I've never been more disappointed receiving a 27 dollar meal. The cut of meat was cooked well, medium, but it was 20 percent fat, and unseasoned and bland. The au jus sauce tasted nothing better than hot water mixed with  a beef ramen flavoring packet, which you had to dunk into because the entire cut of meat was cold. Not lukewarm, cold to the touch of my tongue. Yes, the outside of the meat that was touching the pan while cooking. Now... maybe the sides would redeem this meal. I was optimistic. I ordered a loaded baked potato, and was excited to have a hot stuffed tater with cheese melting all over and bacon. Again, I shit you not, for 27 dollars they give you a potato (it was baked I'll give DiMillo's that) with chives mixed with sour cream, what looked like shredded mozzarella cheese that comes in the bag from market basket, and shredded bacon IN SEPARATE CUPS. Let me repeat that again, IN SEPARATE CUPS. Come on man, I'm sorry but I feel as if my wallet was raped that night. And my stomach. I cannot speak for any of the seafood, my brothers fiancé got the Salmon and she really enjoyed it. 

In conclusion, if you love seafood and want to be comfortably rocked back and forth while you wait for two hours and then eat extremely overpriced sub par bland food, go to DiMillo's and eat yo heart out. Otherwise hit the damn super market, drizzle some lemon juice with garlic and salt & pepper over a 2 pound filet of your favorite fish, be happy your wallet hasn't been rigorously violated",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "
6085,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6085,2018-06-28,"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was just as great.  Some minor things would make this a 5* in my book, but it shouldn't hold people back from going and experiencing this restaurant.  Our table ordered about 2-3 of each app.  The meatball had fresh mozzarella on it and was good.  The clams were good, but I found the mussels to be one of the stars of the night.  The broth goes great with the bread.  The crab cakes were good and I found the shrimp cocktails just a tad over cooked, but not too much.  I had the full stuffed 2.5lb lobster.  The stuffing wasn't something that I'd write home about because I was expecting some more texture to it...BUT the lobster was plentiful and prepared well.  I'll tell you the one star of the night was one I least expected - the lobster Mac and Cheese.  Very very tasty!  I looked at another tables order who had the scallops and they looked really good (we also had the bacon wrapped scallops and those were delicious). I was also happy that the server worked with someone I was with to create a custom vegetarian dish. Again, keep in mind that this is a good rating, but with areas to improve on to make it even better.  The IPA's on tap complimented the food nicely.  I would go back for sure, but next time I'd go with the steamed lobster, the lobster mac and cheese or the scallops.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

We had Katherine as the server today and she was unpleasant and very short. I asked her what was good and she decided to repeat the side items a couple times. Then I asked again and she said everything was good. Since ordering our drinks, she was already impatient and unpleasant. I asked for another server and a few times when Katherine passed by, she gave me a nasty look, cut her eyes at me, and even later stood on the raised seating area and stared. This is uncalled for and immature of someone at her age. She shouldn't be in the food and bev business if she can't provide good service. Lisa, on the other hand, had been the complete opposite with her service and demeanor. If not for Lisa, we would've gotten up and left.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

6088,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6088,2018-04-03,"My family (husband and two young teen boys) were visiting from Michigan, and we were looking forward to a lobster dinner on our last night in Portland. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on DiMillo's. 

There was no wait (Monday night) which was nice. The staff seemed bored and not very welcoming, but I wasn't upset by it at all. Our server was very slow to come to our table, and wasn't very attentive the entire meal. She did, however, take the time to explain how to break apart lobster (it was our first time eating it), which was nice. I wasn't too thrilled that she carded my husband for his drink but didn't card me! Haha, I'm 36 and my husband is 37. 

I ordered the seafood scampi and the rest of the family ordered lobster. The scampi was disappointing--I definitely would not recommend it. It didn't have much flavor at all, and needed salt. The scallops in the scampi were good, but the shrimp and lobster were over cooked. 

My family enjoyed trying lobster for the first time, but all agreed it was overrated. Certainly not worth $230! 

One thing that I really appreciated was that the owner came to our table and chatted with us for a couple of minutes. He was very kind. 

Overall, I gave DiMillo's two stars because of the subpar service, aloof staff, and just so-so food. I was hoping to rave about it, but we wouldn't go there again.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "
