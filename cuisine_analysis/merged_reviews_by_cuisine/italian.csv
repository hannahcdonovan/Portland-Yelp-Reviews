The theme of this restaurant is ""small, except for price"".  
To be fair, the food is very good and well executed. 
The restaurant is tiny, with only a handful of tables and most of the tables only seat 2 people.  We didn't have a reservation but came around 5:30PM during off season.  Restaurant was empty but all of the tables were reserved for later patrons so we were seated at the bar.  We had no issues with this but if you come during peak season, you will need a reservation to get in given the small number of seats.
The menu selection also tiny has a handful of dishes to choose from.  This could be a good thing because it makes it easier for them to control the quality.
Lastly, the food portion is small.  We were hungry an hour after dinner and went on to a ""2nd dinner"".
We ordered the fried brussel sprouts to start.  This was ok, but it didnt wow me.
I ordered the polenta with spicy meatballs.  The polenta was creamy and rich and tasted great.  There were 3 small/medium sized meatballs which also tasted delicious.  They were tender and moist.  i don't have any complaints about the taste.
Hubby ordered the hangar steak.  He said it tasted really good but there were only about 6 slices of the beef.  For the price, he wasn't too happy.
this might be a good lighter fare meal if you aren't too hungry or maybe a late night snack.",4.5,3,"['111 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.659059,-70.25243,"Italian, "
1151,hEPLzr2qI6d3Uu7jOtBpbg,piccolo,1151,2018-12-01,What an adorable restaurant. Their theme is a beautiful blue and porcelain flying pigs. The staff does a great job of making you feel comfortable. The restaurant is small and intimate with small tables and a large kitchen bar. I split a bottle of the Verona wine which was beautiful and light. We shared the bolognese which had good flavor and the lamb neck cavatelli. Between the two Id definitely recommend the cavatelli pasta. Both were homemade but the cavatelli just had more interesting flavors. We were too full to try anything else but if youre in the moo homemade pasta in an intimate setting with beautiful wine I'd recommend piccolo.,4.5,3,"['111 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.659059,-70.25243,"Italian, "

Somewhat hidden, and as tiny as the name suggests, this restaurant is cranking out some of the best rustic Italian food in the country.

I love Italian food, but I rarely go out for Italian food in the States because it all tends to taste the same.  The first thing I noticed about Piccolo is that it is not like all of the other East Coast Italian joints.  In fact, it is nothing like them.  No sad eggplant parm or soggy lasagna here, Piccolo serves dishes from the countryside of Central/Southern Italy.  Think hearty homemade pasta, braised meats, and unique seafood specials.

Keeping with the theme of the restaurant, the menu is tiny.  Only a few dishes listed and a few seasonal specials.  What the menu lacks in size, it makes up for in flavor.  Everything I've had here has been off the charts delicious.  I highly recommend whatever seasonal house-made pasta they are serving.

Piccolo takes reservations on Yelp, and if I were you, I'd go ahead and make a reservation for the soonest available opening.",4.5,3,"['111 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.659059,-70.25243,"Italian, "

They also have a second restaurant called Chaval (which I also wrote a review for). When we first walked in, it was dark, romantic, an upscale atmosphere. I was super excited that we were there. First impressions are always the best impressions! We ordered a few glasses of wine, the Melanzane (eggplant) for an appetizer which was super tasty and delicate!

Our server was attentive and helpful and made lovely wine recommendations. And the pasta was phenomenal, made in house, and served with great attention to detail. 

The second time I went, we were celebrating my partner's birthday and they made the experience so memorable. Our server was my co-conspirator in preparing a surprise birthday dessert complete with a candle, that my partner had no idea she and I arranged when I excused myself to use the restroom. 

We started with a cheese board with carefully selected cheeses that were so delicious we made notes to find them for ourselves. My scallop dish was inventive and flavorful, and beautiful to boot. I barely got to try my partner's steak before it disappeared from his plate, but what I snuck a sample of was tender and delightful. We ended with a frittelle for dessert, that was light for being fried dough and we finished the whole thing despite being so full because it was just too good to waste.

Lastly, for our entrees, we ordered the pork medallion special with haricot verts and the steak bistecca. If you miss the opportunity to order the bistrcca, shame on you!! It is OUTSTANDING!

The food was great.  I loved my breakfast and INHALED it.  I also like that they have bottomless mimosas for brunch.  HOWEVER....

...the execution of the above left a lot to be desired.  Our server was PAINFULLY slow and not even apologetic about the pace.

Small restaurant with amazing attention to detail. They do not mass-produce, as they closely monitor how many people come in.

It was pouring rain as we walked by, and happened upon this place. Reservations? No.... One second, let me check *she runs to the kitchen*....okay, no problem. 

Started with the most delicious, balanced negroni. Strong, but not too strong or bitter. Homemade focaccia with rosemary. Homemade fettuccine, beef bolognese with kale, topped with orange zest and buttered breadcrumbs. Perfectly portioned in a pipping hot bowl. Pair it with a nice glass of veneto. 

For dessert: woody, perfectly balanced French pressed coffee with a caramel cake, low-bush blueberries and mascarpone... from their James Beard-nominated pastry chef. Yes. Deliciously salty and sweet.

1176,hEPLzr2qI6d3Uu7jOtBpbg,piccolo,1176,2015-02-20,"Piccolo is charming... such a small building tucked next to the Police Department, you might miss it if you weren't intentionally looking for it. The restaurant seats only twenty people and is full almost every single night of the year - I now know why!

My friends and I had the chance to check it out and were treated to a night of exceptional service and food:

The wine (beer, and even lone cider) selection(s) are just delightful and reasonably priced.

The cheese board was only $11 (like cocktails, cheese boards in this city are beginning to be irrationally expensive, so it's a breath of fresh air that Piccolo has their's set at such a low price) and featured three very unique cheeses (one tasted like a thick Greek yogurt, one had an ashy/herby rind and was sort of blue cheese-y in flavor, and the other was thick and would have made an exceptional, tangy grilled cheese), an orange mortada, and three wedges of a grilled fruit and nut type bread. I could have eaten one of those with a glass of wine and been perfectly satiated (doesn't hurt that you get extra bread and olive oil to munch on as well).

The servers were attentive, humorous, engaging, gracious, and respectful of our space and time. Couldn't have asked for a better flow of service!

The desserts we had that night were a lovely way to end the meal. One was (and this is my sad pedestrian explanation, so please forgive me) similar to a fried dough with honey; the other was a chocolate pudding with chocolate cake, rose water cream, nuts, and sea salt... it might sound chaotic, but the flavors all worked perfectly with each other. Paired with French pressed coffee, I had a difficult time sharing.

But what I REALLY want to impress upon you is the lengths in which Piccolo will go to please their customers. It's above and beyond anything I've experienced in town...

There were three vegetarians at the table, and while there were no vegetarian options on the menu, the server made it VERY clear to us that this wasn't an issue - all we had to do was tell her our dietary restrictions, likes and dislikes, and they'd customize a bowl of pasta for us specifically. Not the collective ""us"" who were vegetarians, but each individual who asked.

Vegetarian Bowl #1: Our friend couldn't have cheese and didn't want mushrooms. The server, mediating between kitchen and customer, checked in with her at least three times to see what she could eat/couldn't eat before serving her some hearty looking bowl with olives and nuts and butternut squash that looked nothing short of amazing. I may have stared at her the entire time she was eating it.

Vegetarian Bowl #2: My significant other wanted cheese and no olives. In the end he got something similar to Bowl #1, but with big scoops of ricotta cheese (and, of course, no olives).

Vegetarian Bowl #3: I got something entirely different (again, after the server went back and forth between the kitchen and myself to essentially a coordinate a perfect-for-me meal) - angel hair pasta with broccoli rabe, and a copious amount of freshly grated parmesan with a soft boiled egg hiding underneath it all. I've never had anything like it! Warm and gooey and flavorful in just the ways you would think. SO GOOD.

Each vegetarian bowl was on the lower end of the spectrum at $21 a piece. And, apparently, according to our server you could come here every week as a vegetarian and they'd always make you something new. Seriously... who does this? Who in Portland does this?!

Piccolo. They do this.

This was by no means a cheap or fast meal. It was decadent and the perfect amount of leisurely. But it's a luxury I can see myself doing on date nights or even ""me"" nights... which, let's face it, we all need to have from time to time!",4.5,3,"['111 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.659059,-70.25243,"Italian, "

Next criterion: alcohol. The wine and beer list was impressive. It had a variety of drinks that would suit any preference and the hostesses were very knowledgable about all the offerings. I tried the Cesanese red wine and a cider and I would definitely get both again!

Third criterion: service. In addition to the servers being knowledgable (and fully capable of pronouncing all the fancy Italian names), they were friendly and attentive. I was never wanting for anything and every action was performed with a smile. =) 

The chefs were so accommodating to the dietary preferences of the table! I was impressed with how each vegetarian order was handled. They didn't each get a generic dish, but rather a dish tailored to their preferences. It looked tasty and they seemed pleased. 

I had the lamb pasta dish (forgive me for not remembering the fancy name) and it was super tasty and hearty. So hearty that I couldn't finish it (well the cheese platter and bread helped with that) but I was so happy to bring the rest into work the next day.  I'm sure my coworkers were jealous. 

Last criterion: dessert! They have dessert wines and coffees but I went for the good stuff--Italian funnel cake. It was fried with fennel seeds and covered with powdered sugar and honey. So so so tasty (that's the word of the night). The dough was light and had the right amount of crisp on the outside. I also sampled a friend's chocolate cake and it was super rich. Both desserts are winners. 

Not gonna lie all of this added up, but it was worth every penny. The service, venue, food quality, and flavors are all worth the price and experience.

The husband and wife who are the chef/pastry chef as well as the owners came out of the kitchen to serve and describe the food, as well as chat when they had the time. Wine pairings made sense and were lovingly described by the wonderful front of house manager/sommelier.

I loved just about everything about this restaurant. I'll start by saying that it's great for vegetarians. They can make a custom pasta dish and there are several vegetarian options on the menu that change daily. 

When we booked, they called us to check if we had any special preferences. When we got there, they remembered our preferences and confirmed them with us.

The restaurant only seats 20 people total and is served by 2 wonderful servers. Both were very personable and charming. 

We ordered the cheese plate (yum!), bruschetta (wow!), and the veggie pesto pasta designed by the chef. The side of chickpea fritters was underwhelming.

I drank the sangiovese which was perfect with the pasta... and then the best part: the dessert. We got the chocolate cup which was so good that we had to get a second one!

We went this weekend and it couldn't have been more pleasant. Asked for a window table and they were nice enough to call when it became available ahead of our reservation time in the event we wanted to come early. 
The salumi platter was outstanding--generous selection of pate and sausages, many of them house-cured. Highly recommended. 
We shared the sea bream special for two and it was a really nice fish. Perhaps a bit on the small side for two people, but it was super tasty. The panna cotta dessert was bright and delicious, though a bit runnier than it should have been.

We sat at the bar/chef's table, and were very comfortable. Unlike several tables, you are not in any traffic pattern nor are you sharing space with those waiting to be seated.  

We both had the monkfish, and it was delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We ordered both sides, the chickpea fritters and the roasted brussel sprouts. Each had unique sauces drizzled on top with just enough heat to enhance their flavors without being overpowering.

 Would like to be able to dock a half star and give 41/2 stars due to dessert, which was the only misstep in an otherwise outstanding meal.  The baked apple  served over spiced cake was underwhelming,  the apple was hard and tough, very difficult to cut, and had a strong, almost bitter taste.

Final course, lamb shank with polenta. My husband loved this dish. In fact, he took his leftovers home, which he never does.

Also, I need to mention just how GREAT the service was. I forget her name, but the waitress was just the right level of accommodating: considerate without being nosy or pushy. In my online reservation I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday, and she came out with a candle in his dessert. It was a small touch but very thoughtful.

If this restaurant were only in Brooklyn, I'd be as permanent a fixture as I hope this wonderful team (servers included) remains for diners in the lucky town where they've chosen to open their doors. 

This is everything I look for in a restaurant - beautiful and fresh food made with love, a GREAT wine list and easy decor, in a room they could have crammed with more tables but haven't, which allowed five of us to relax and not feel packed like the poor.

We started with the Formaggio, which was served with a fig mostarda that EXPLODED in concert with the chesses - truly spectacular. While waiting for our main courses, we nibbled on one of their special vegetable offerings - peak-of-season snap peas.  

Wanting to get a full range of the menu (and knowing my friends wouldn't mind my sampling their entrees), I opted for two appetizers as my main course. I ended up with a beautiful roasted eggplant stew with smoked ricotta and tomato - a sort of unbreaded parmigiana that just sat back and let the freshness speak for itself - and the second of their special vegetable offerings of the day... a personal favorite of fiddleheads that were prepared to perfection, with just a tiny hit of chili, and tender as I've ever tasted.

The Del Mer entree of black cod was exquisite, as was the pork lasagna - and I give special props to both the kitchen and staff for coming out to inform us of a change in the side accompaniments to the fish. It's a big thing when a dish changes, and it could be for many reasons; I always admire a kitchen so committed to putting their best dish out that they pull an item from a plate. They wanted to let us know, however, and give us an opportunity to make our own decision about ours and their choices; of course my friends stuck with the kitchen and were as impressed as I was.

The red wine we chose complimented everyone's dinners, just as the moscato complimented our desserts - we universally went with the budino (a pot du creme with awesome hazelnut forward taste and ""Beer rocks"" which were a refreshing surprise -crunchy and adding just the right kick to the dish).

This place is an absolute GEM. Again, I only wish I didn't have to go to JFK to eat there.

I am a vegetarian but typically there isn't a vegetarian entree option on the menu. The first time or two, our server Kelly - who gets five stars of her own for being such a professional and a pleasure - rattled off a few ingredients and I indicated my likes or dislikes. Kelly or Ilma (co-owner) would ferry my preferences to Damian in the kitchen. After a while they stopped asking and I started trusting. Every dish was inconceivably better than the previous. Last night's meal literally brought a tear to my eye.

*Restaurant opened 5+ minutes late, even though they had called to confirm we'd be there for the 10:30 open. 
*It was another 10 minutes before the menus came out because they weren't printed.
*Tack on another 25 before the simple cheese plate and zeppole came out. The cheese plate had a total of six slices of cheese (two Pecorino and 4 Caciocavalli), two flats of house made foccia and a dab of fig mostarda ($9) The bread was grilled, but had a acridity to it that masked  the flavors of the cheese.  The zeppole was good, mini-fried dough balls with a side of a sweet dipping sauce and, had we to do it again, we would have nixed the Formaggio and gone for a double order of the zeppole. 

Our entrees would ok--a pork shoulder hash that was a little too greasy and overdone with the herbs mixed in. My wife had polenta, poached eggs, sausage and more of the grilled foccacia. She gave a shrug of the shoulders when I asked her about it and just pointed out layer of oil that laid between the polenta and the eggs.

Overall, the brunch did not do anything to entice us back for an evening visit.  I believe we'll stick to his sandwiches at Blue Rooster.",4.5,3,"['111 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.659059,-70.25243,"Italian, "

Innovative without being fussy, spot on portion sizes instead of huge (Hugo's I'm looking at you). Stop reading this, just go. It's wonderful.

Baby artichokes were fried perfectly (light and not greasy), seasoned just right. Pork ragu was light and unexpected, not too creamy or heavy on tomato. The deckle section of the rib eye they serve is perfect.

Currently, the ""Del Mar"" is my favorite seafood dish in Portland. Subtle, fresh and unique, it's hard to describe. The calamari is a great starter too.

The ambience inside is lovely - the place feels like a jewel box! But the food was fantastic...in particular the ""del mar"", which was made with Hake as the fish. Incredibly fresh - I had never had hake before, but it was prepared perfectly. Flaky, and it's subtle flavor was complimented by the red pepper sauce that came with it. 

Small wine list, but quite good. The Frommagio cheese appetizer was wonderful - good selection of sheep and cow's cheese.

Dessert was phenomenal - it was a chocolate ""cake"" with mushrooms with a touch of cherry, chocolate cake and a cream, layered in a small glass jar. I am not doing justice with my description but it was awesome. Small serving - wish my two companions hadn't decided to ""share"" mine!

Service perfect - our waitress was attentive without being overbearing, and seemed to do a great job of managing all her tables (again it's small so only one server).

After taking my out of town friends to Eventide for some amazing oysters, we dropped into Piccolo for what turned out to be another amazing meal.  

If you have a discerning palate, this is your place.  If your view is quantity over quality or heavy flavors that don't allow the food to shine through, it's not.

The staff is so knowledgable about the wines, cheeses and ingredients. Their view on both wines and cheeses is to find unique and/or highly allocated wines that you won't see elsewhere.  That's always a treat.

I had the cavatelli with the uber flavorful lamb neck ragu. The hint of orange is a beautiful touch. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and the soft egg created a delicious sauce.  Honestly, I don't know what others had because I was so into my food.

**I have to respond to a comment below:  If you wanted bread with the asparagus dish, why didn't ask for some?  The bread - made in house - is to die for.  Also, this dish, while uniquely done here, is pretty ubiquitous in fine dining but rarely served with bread.**

The eggplant was perfectly crispy on the outside and delicately soft on the inside - the way it's supposed to be.

The restaurant itself is supposed to feel like you're at home - and we did.  Between the conversation with the Piccolo family, the light music, and the great company courtesy of my friends from Atlanta, we had a blast.

The calamari was my favorite, a perfect light summer dish with refreshing citrus to compliment the tender squid.
We had our choice of entree; Cavatelli (a house made pasta lamb ragu staple we had the first time we came which is excellent), Del Mar (I had this baked black cod cooked to perfection, literally melted off the fork), Maiale (braised pork coppa that was very flavorful), and Bistecca (roasted hanger steak). 
The apex of the meal was the Crostata, house made lemon tart that was to die for. I would never order a tart as my dessert of choice but it was for my aunts birthday and she loves fruit tarts.

I have to say that the Sunday Supper they offer is one of the best meals I have ever had the pleasure to consume, and the price is ridiculous for the amount of food you are served. At the end of our meal we told them they should charge more for it, and we weren't kidding, it was that good. 
To top it off, Chefs Damian and Ilma personally serve and describe several of the dishes they have created, just for you, that evening.

Upon walking in, the venue has a interesting, but cool aesthetic. There is a unique bar/host stand in the middle that gives the restaurant a modern flair, with table seating throughout the place. There is not a lot of seating due to the small space, so it is important to make a reservation in advance.

We were seated by the host and we were quickly greeted by our waitress who told us about their specials and took our drink order. Perusing the menu, there are not a lot of options, but the focus is definitely on the fact that they make their own pasta. They have limited options with proteins, such as classics like chicken parmesan or chicken marsala, but for me it works for Paciarino. The prices range from $18-24, which I don't think is horrible for hand-made pasta dishes.

I ended up ordering the goat cheese ravioli. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that it was in had a nice spice and tang to it. The portion size was actually decent as well, with probably about 12-15 medium-sized raviolis in my dish.

Where to start? The bruschette was delicious and very authentic. I had a glass of the house wine ($6 - tasted like my favorite Cabernet Sauvignon) which paired beautifully with their classic tomato sauce found on the bruschette and in a number of main courses. We had the fusilli with tuna and the macheroni with olives. Again, both were great!

2672,LuzEPoDRJEpSMrqlr_sCPQ,paciarino,2672,2014-03-23,"Several weeks ago an irresistible craving for delicious Italian food struck, and I immediately thought of Paciarino. Sadly, their winter hours are Wednesday-Saturday, and they were closed when we arrived. So we tried Ribolita which was disappointing.

A week later we tried again on a Wednesday, just to find the owners have traveled to Italy to renew their Visas and the restaurant is only open on weekends. So we settled on the Corner Room which was ok, but the craving remained.

Days later we tried on a Friday and couldn't get in. Our backup was Vignola which wasn't very good at all, besides the pizza. But this wasn't an urge for pizza, as Portland has that in abundance.

Finally last night (a Saturday) we secured an 8 pm reservation. And Paciarino remains the best Italian in Portland by far. I don't think it's even close (disclaimer: I have not tried Piccolo).

 The bread, slathered in olive oil and cut into small pieces was perfection. Our server, who could easily be a hipster librarian during daylight, was the best server I've had in months. The goat cheese ravioli melts in the mouth and the portion was large enough for leftovers. The wine list is solid with some $6 glasses, which is unusual for this restaurant class.  The atmosphere is cute and feels like dinner in my grandmother's living room (if she was an Italian immigrant).

2674,LuzEPoDRJEpSMrqlr_sCPQ,paciarino,2674,2013-11-07,"(Please note... this is actually 4 1/2 star review!)

I discovered this lovely little Italian restaurant entirely in thanks to Yelp! I was inspired to check it out on my birthday specifically because of the review that gushed about how delicious the Mozzarella di Bufala appetizer was when turned into a caprese salad. That's what drew me to the unassuming, yet entirely charming place on the corner of Fore and Cross.

Taking the advice of others, I also made sure to make a reservation (again: thanks, Yelp, for making it super easy to do so!). When we got there at 5:55, almost every other table who had a 6pm res was already seated. There was a younger couple in front of us who ended up sitting at the ""bar"" because they hadn't made one. I almost wish we had been them, because our table was directly in front of the bathrooms. It didn't ruin the experience, but trying to have an intimate/romantic evening out to celebrate a milestone b-day wasn't entirely doable when we had people hovering around our table for the loo every ten or fifteen minutes.

The decor suited both my tastes and soul (the blue and yellow paint compliment each other perfectly, it made me feel right at home). It's got that rustic farm-meets European art/coffee house-meets ""Hey, you're still in Portland!"" vibe to it.

Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing - she was ever-present. Who doesn't love a server that's there right when you want them to be?

We ordered a bottle of the house red wine (for about $23), and it was delicious. Both my partner and I got about three glasses out of it, which was ideal and just enough considering it was a 12% or 13% ABV.

The Mozzarella di Bufala as a caprese salad was entirely sensual. It was fragrant, creamy, flavorful, and had an amazing mouthfeel... I couldn't get enough. It was one of those foods that made me feel sad upon eating the last bite. So yes, it's as delicious as everyone has said. Even our waitress said it was her favorite thing to eat on the menu! Go there. Get this. The end.

For main courses I ordered the Maccheroni Paesani which is listed on their menu as ""a really loved pasta shape, short and welcoming, topped with an imported taleggio cheese sauce, olive taggiasche, and ground black pepper."" I was smitten with the concept of this dish, and knew weeks prior to coming that it was what I wanted to eat. Unfortunately, it (along with the bathrooms) was the low of the experience. Basically, it was a far too expensive, over-glorified macaroni and cheese (how boring, right?), and will go down as one of the more unmemorable things I've eaten. It didn't taste of taleggio at all, and there were literally ONLY four or five olives on the entire plate.

I am SO thankful for my date who traded me for his ravioli filled with pumpkin and crushed amaretto cookies, topped with a heavy sprinkle of fresh parmesan cheese and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Which was DIVINE and one of the most flavorful and perfect foods I've EVER consumed.  Each bite was entirely moan-worthy. 

I regret not getting dessert. I had been craving an espresso with either (or both!) the tiramisu and the boccondivino, but ended up bypassing both for a cupcake down the road. Schoolgirl error. If you're here and you're doing the wine, app, main course thing, then you might as well splurge and do dessert, too!

So... would I come here again? Though much more expensive than what I'm personally used to, the answer is: 100% absolutely. It might be my new FAVORITE ""fancy"" spot in Portland.

2680,LuzEPoDRJEpSMrqlr_sCPQ,paciarino,2680,2015-06-25,"Paciarino is a small, simple Italian restaurant. The pasta and sauces are all scratch made, and sold separately for customers to try them at home. The lunch menu is fairly simplistic. My parents had the small green salad. It was amply filled with wild greens and oil and wine vinegar. A generous portion.

The bolognese sauce was decent. It had flavor highlights of the ground fresh veal used in its making. True to its origin, the sauce is heavily meat based, with the tomato being a secondary component. It paired nicely with the goat cheese ravioli, which was perfectly cooked el dente and again, amply portioned for a lunch item. The house chianti was flavorful and complimented the menu nicely. 

The theme here is pasta and sauce, which I feel the restaurant does fine. I'd personally like to see a bit more expansive and creative menu....but, that said, they do a good job with their niche...which is pasta and sauce.

The lunch items are roughly $10...a good value for the scratch cooking that goes into making the dishes. Three lunches, two salads, and a half carafe of chianti was $55 with tip....which is a decent lunch for three.

The environment here is very homey, with a true family feel where the staff either know everyone or want to know everyone. Even though it was our first time, we ended up feeling like regulars by the time the meal ended. 
It's a small and very popular place, so either call and make a reservation (especially if it's for a party if more than 2) or hope to get seated at the bar, which is where we ended up (perfect seats to watch march madness). The bartender was our server and was incredibly nice- she even gave me a free coffee martini that they'd accidentally made extra of, which was a nice touch. 
The amount of food options that sounded delicious was almost overwhelming, but in a good way. We were truly torn about what to order and kept peaking at the dishes leaving the kitchen to see if that could help in making a decision- spoiler alert: it didn't, everything looked amazing.
We finally settled on starting with the popular short rib ravioli which was one of the best parts of the entire meal. The sauce was rich, the meat tender and the ravioli soft and creamy- I could easily have this for dinner and be happy. 
For entrees we ordered the asparagus risotto with mushroom dusted scallops and WOW was it incredible. So creamy and fresh. It's no wonder that it has been recommended by so many others! 
We also had the shrimp athena which had pesto, feta, sun dried tomatoes and all sorts of other delicious antipasto-type of things. Pro tip: ask for a hefty serving of fresh parmesan on top- it always makes life better.

I've heard the rave reviews but have honestly never headed over because after praising the food, people almost always mention how cramped the space is and how it often feels impossible to have a private conversation.  
So one Friday night, after being sick for an entire week, I realized I was starving at 9pm, and suggested to my husband that we walk over and see if we could get a table.
When we arrived, the place was surprisingly busy, BUT there was one table available.  We were seated promptly, and yes, we were close to a cabinet that held things the waitstaff needed, and very close to the next table.  We tried really hard to keep our voices down, especially when the couple next to us appeared to be having a special night out.
A most lovely waitress came to take our drink order and answer questions about the menu.
We decided on the pistachio mussels and stuffed mushrooms, and then an order of eggplant rollatini to share.
Bread and herb butter was brought right away.  While we were waiting for the apps, I was able to really look around.  There do seem to be some tables along the back wall that have more space, and therefore, more privacy.  In the front room, it appeared to be mostly high top seating, which I know can also be tricky for some people.
When our apps arrived, we really liked the stuffed mushrooms, but LOVED the pistachio mussels.  These were by far the best mussels I have ever had, and I love mussels!  
The eggplant rollatini was also fantastic, and I LOVE eggplant rollatini!
I started scanning the menu board, trying to decide what I would order in the future.
On the walk home, I thought about how the quality of the food and friendliness of the service far surpassed the squishy seating.  On the other hand, we did show up at 9pm for dinner, I have no idea what it feels like when the place is really hopping!

We had reservations and the one friend of the group who had been here prior said it was one of her favorite places to eat. The rest of us as newbies decided to give it a try. As you can see by the star rating, I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. 

This establishment is on the outskirts of the Portland downtown. It's located in almost a strip mall kind of building. Parking is limited and the space inside is tiny! The bar space, forget it. There are only a handful of tables which is fine but it feels like all the tables are on top of one another. Our table was up against some piece of furniture containing glassware so those two people didn't have a lot of room. I sat on the side with more room but had the air conditioner blowing on me and it was freezing. Good thing I wore a sweater. But even with that, it was way too cold. 

There were a ton of specials on the specials board. I asked about the Chicken Romano and it sounded good based on the description from the waitress: chicken that is coated in egg, pan fried, and served with a garlic sauce. What I got served was a small appetizer sized plate with chicken and a cream sauce spilling off the plate (and actually spilled on another friend's dish as the waitress served it). There were garlic mashed potatoes but barely seen because random steamed vegetables were scattered all across the top. It made me question f this restaurant even has a person who works the kitchen to approve the presentation and quality of the meals before being served. The meal was lukewarm and didn't have much flavor. I thought a garlic sauce would be garlicky, like a scampi or something, but this wasn't that way. 

Our dinner reservation was for 7pm and we were seated right away at that time. At 9pm, having finished our meals for a while, we still did not have our check. Our waitress was not attentive to us throughout the meal, didn't ask how our meal was, and someone else cleared the dishes. Since 2 hours for dinner was enough in this tiny and frigid space, we had to chase down the waitress who finally gave us our check 10 or so minutes later. 

This restaurant was a disappointment. The generous two stars are for the bread and garlic butter that came with the table. Other than that, I don't plan on returning to this establishment.

For dinner we had one of the chicken specials (with garlic mash and veggies) and the veal Constantine over pasta. Both dishes were amazing!

The menu is varied, with an emphasis on southern Italian favorites. There are always 6-8 specials on top of a strong menu. 

The four of us shared a few apps. The short rib ravioli are good, actually a dish with some nice finesse to the sauce...which was a light, beef based au jus, with very nice flavor. The bruschetta was also good, with a nice but somewhat heavy mozzarella covering over rustic tomatoes. We also tried the crab cakes, which were tasty. The remoulard  sauce, that accompanied, was a bit unimaginative, but overall it was a decent dish. 

My main course was a veal, seafood, pasta and sauce medley. It was a ton of food, with nothing preparation or flavor wise that was negative. For me personally, it was a bit bulky, with too much sauce, and too breaded of a veal application. This is a bit of a nit pick, and overall, I'm sure this is a strong favorite.

   Pros - take reservations!  Food fantastic.  My husband had the short rib ravioli to start.  He wanted to save some room for dinner, but couldn't stop eating these.  He had rigatoni bolognese for main course.  He enjoyed this as well.  I ordered the meatballs and mozarella for app.  These tasted good, but a bit more hamburgery than I like.  I had parmesan crusted haddock.  This was scruptious!  Garlic smashed potatoes, spinach, summer squash, red peppers.

4705,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4705,2017-09-01,"Well - I'll start by saying that the food at JPs was very, very good. That is the only reason I haven't given them one star today. 

The service, however is another story. I called and made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for my boyfriend's birthday. When we arrived, I was told that the reservation was not in their book. They made me look through all of the reservations listed over 3-4 days not once, not twice, but three different times. I told them that my information is not in the book, yet I have documentation in my phone from the day and time that I called and made the reservation. After a back and forth I asked them to please remedy the situation and seat us because they were embarrassing me in front of the guests of our party. 

RELUCTANTLY, the host brought us to a table directly next to the kitchen. Several members of the staff made it a point to vocalize that we needed to get in and out of the restaurant quickly, since we didn't have a reservation. Two servers talked about it openly right behind my boyfriend and I while they were standing in the kitchen and our server mentioned it outright to us when we asked for a few more minutes to review the menu - stating we needed to make a decision quickly. 

Then, we weren't brought any bread (unlike every other table in the restaurant), so I stopped a server walking by and asked her politely if we could please have some bread. She rolled her eyes, went into the kitchen and then dropped the bread onto the table. 

The icing on the cake (birthday pun intended) however is that when I told our server it was my boyfriend's birthday, she then asked him what he would like for dessert. She brought out the bill a few moments later and had charged us for the birthday dessert she INSISTED on bringing out. $9 for Tiramisu. 

I could not have been more embarrassed and felt more slighted. I went out of my way to ensure that our plans for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party were solidified well in advance and then because of someone else's mistake we were made to feel like burdens until we left. 

Again, the only redeeming quality is that the food was good. But I don't know if I'll ever go back simply because of the fiasco they put us through.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

We were staying with our inlaws nearby and after a long day with the three year old, didn't think we'd be able to get downtown and back without a meltdown. And because we were on vacation, as serious foodies, we wanted a decent meal. Yelp steered us here and we could not have been happier! As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a small place. We didn't make a reservation - but went right away when they opened at 4 p.m. They were able to seat us, but did say they needed the table by 5:30. Worked out fine for us since we knew the little one would be losing it by then anyway. 

They have a great wine list for a place of this size - including lower end quality options like the William Hill Chard and the Angeline Pinot. Plus a LOT of fun varietals from Italy - we went with the recommendation of our server in terms of the varietal (Montepulciano) for our meals. We both ordered the short rib ravioli which was to die for delicious. I had the scallops with risotto (which was pretty good, though the scallops were a bit overdone) and my partner ordered a special they had going - some sort of seafood lasagna that was also quite tasty. They were lovely about bringing out some simple things for us to have the three year old eat - some plain pasta, cut up cucumbers, and bread. We also had a lovely chocolate cake desert.

On my most recent trip, I shared the Calamari and Asparagus Salad. The asparagus was by far my favorite! I've been pleased with all the entre√©s, except for the Linguini in White Clam sauce. I'm not sure what made up the sauce, but it looked like millions of tiny little baby clams... While it wasn't exactly unpleasant, I wouldn't choose to eat it again.

4710,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4710,2015-03-21,"JP's is a not-so-secret little gem. Located by Cumberland Farms in Rosemont Center, the space is small but attractive. It's become quite busy so reservations are a good idea, and be prepared for close quarters.

The namesake chef is somewhat of a local legend. He formerly worked at a series of more divey bars (Samuels, Bernie's) which was an odd fit for his upscale cuisine. You can order a variety of foods off the regular menu but the expansive specials menu holds the best surprises. Think rich dishes of fish, chicken and veal loaded with butter and oil. JP's is definitely not health food, but it is delicious. Last night the chicken francese and swordfish couldn't have been better.

With the flood of expensive, small plate restaurants opening in Portland recently, JP's is a relief. The portions are as substantial as the menu and you'll leave completely stuffed. Price points are slightly cheaper than downtown too in the $18-$23 range.

JP's is one of the best restaurants outside of the Old Port, and It's great to have such a satisfying option without having to deal with the parking hassles.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

The only hiccup was that, since we had to wait a bit for our table, the hostess promised us free desserts but did not convey that to the waitress who never offered it--a bit awkward. We got our hopes up for dessert but didn't make it an issue.

4715,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4715,2017-02-22,"""Goin' down to Rosedale, got my rider by my side.""

On the advice of a friend we did go down to crossroads Rosemont, not Rosedale, and checked out JP Bistro for the first time.  It takes up two units in its 1930's strip-mall (like Congress Street's club Blue) which makes for an intimate setting; especially since one unit is taken up by a bar-type arrangement with high tables, and the kitchen.  

We started with a prosecco wine for my wife, while I tried a house mixed drink called 'porto manhattan', a manhattan made with port wine instead of sweet vermouth.  The acidy wine cut through the sweet bourbon in an interesting way.  Though I prefer a sweeter mix this would be appreciated by those who like a dryer drink.
 
Our server brought freshly made crusty bread (oh, heaven!) and a ramekin of butter which was mixed with garlic and herbs and the tastiest we've had for several years.  For a main course I checked out the veal piccata (lemon sauce and capers) which was tender, slightly piquant, and savory.  My wife ordered her go-to meal of ribeye steak which comes in two versions; Bourbon and ... I've forgotten ... with french fries.  She said that was very good.   I like vegetables so I pay attention to them:  These were sauteed, firm but not underdone.  I chose rice instead of pasta so as not to override the taste of the vegetables and piccata sauce.  All in all, a very satisfying experience in one of Portland's signature-type small restaurants.

The Details:  You definitely need to make reservations; come early if you want to park in front.  Mixed drinks, $10 range.  Entrees generally between $20 - $30.  Interestingly, the owner has chosen to break out Maine's minimum wage escalation separately on the check so if you chose to you could adjust your tip in compensation, though I do not.  Servers work hard for their money.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "
4716,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4716,2017-03-06,"Been living in Portland for years, and this is my first time trying JP's. A friend and I came for dinner to try something new. The place was absolutely packed. The waitstaff were pleasantly dealing with the crowd as best as they could, but it was a little claustrophobic. Our table was right next to the china cabinet near the back of the ""main"" dining area, which made it awkward for us to chat with our waitress. We also had another waitress reach over us to grab something from the cabinet. Nothing to terrible, it just made it a bit difficult to enjoy the ambiance.

I ordered a couple of glasses of wine, neither of which I was especially fond of, but I'm no wine aficionado,  and the waitress did make an attempt to suggest an option, but I went ahead and chose something myself. 

Prior to our main course, I ordered the bruchetta for an appetizer, which came out in a reasonable amount of time. The toast was perfectly toasted, and the tomatoes were on point. This was a solid appetizer. Also the bread and garlic butter was delicious.

Because I had never been here before, I chose to order off the menu instead of ordering a special. I believe that a restaurant should always do their stand bys on a menu perfectly. My choice for my meal was (if my memory is correct) the chicken campagnola pasta dish. It was linguine in a wine sauce with cherry tomatoes, chicken, sausage and peppers. The first few bites I thought were a bit bland, with the sauce being a little watery, but as I delved more into the dish, and the ingredients marinated amongst one another, I ended up enjoying the end result, though was a bit underwhelmed.

Okay...so why three stars? When we got our bill, it was well over 90 bucks for the two of us, and my friend didn't even have an entree. We aren't cheapskates, and I knew going in this wasn't going to be simple Amatos food, but for what I had, it was quite expensive. Also attached to our bill was a mandatory gratuity because of the new Portland minimum wage. According to our waitress, this is for additional staff or something like that, who do not get tipped, so we're compelled to pay a regular 20% tip on top of the mandatory gratuity on our bill. This left a bad taste in my mouth. If you are going to make a mandatory gratuity, do so for everyone, including waitstaff, so I don't need to pay separate gratuity.  The minimum wage is only 10 bucks right now, I mean come on.

I likely won't feel the urge to return any time soon.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

It was an incredible dish! The crab cakes were phenomenal as was the short rib ravioli. The ravioli was served in a broth rather than red sauce, which our daughter didn't expect, but the broth turned out to be a vey flavorful dip for the awesome bread. My wife had the Parmesan encrusted haddock which, let us all just say, provided a taste bud orgasm. The asparagus salad was a grand slam as well. Terry served us and kept everything coming at a steady pace, including the watermelon jalape√±o margaritas which were also increds!!! She knows her job and does it very well. Got to meet JP and compliment him, (he is the owner/chef), and he straightaway said we had to try the key lime pie. We do not usually do dessert because we tend to overeat a bit when the food is so good. He insisted we try it and even said he would buy it for us. Again, taste bud explosion!!!

When I went to the restaurant, I thought I should have eaten there! Great atmosphere, great wait staff, and seating at the bar for dinner as well as outside. The aroma of good food hit me when I walked in. The person who took my order hustled to finish some orders and quickly got mine to go.

Wondered if fish to go was a mistake, but haddock is a firm fish and the Parmesan crust made it hold up well. I was eating it maybe 15 min after pickup, and it was yummy. The vegetables were crisp and fresh. When I looked at the portion I thought I could eat half. Before I knew it, all the fish and veggies were demolished!

4743,m_q2VwqlbnPmIdsjOFmXgA,jp's-bistro,4743,2014-11-13,"Dining at a place like JP's Bistro makes one reevaluate all the five star ratings they've handed out, as all of a sudden you realize other places just can't be rated the same as JP's.

How to begin, the food was spectacular, the service was spectacular, and the atmosphere was great.  

The first night I ordered Shrimp Athena, the wife the crab cake appetizer and a half order of shrimp scampi.  We're not used to places that offer you half orders of things.  It's not noted on the menu, but worked out great for us.

My Shrimp Athena was one of the very best meals I have ever eaten in my life.  The shrimp were large, perfectly cooked and plentiful.  But the sauce really made it so special.  My wife surprisingly allowed me a taste of her scampi, and it was unbelievable too, the best scampi I've ever had,  quite a different style to it.
So when we were done, we got up from the table, and went to the hostess station to make reservations for the next night, our last night on our vacation here.

The second night I had chicken Parmesan, the wife shrimp scampi again, and French onion soup.  She said the soup was great, and guarded her scampi from me this time.  My chicken parmesan was great, quite different from any I've had, and a very large portion which I couldn't finish.  The one bad thing was that my side of linguine was kind of cold.  

The service was amazing.  It wasn't stuffy, the emotionless proper service.  Everyone we interacted with was genuinely friendly, and very helpful.  The first night the managers little brother who was in training, was our server.

The menu on-line is less than half of what they actually had, as on a blackboard they had specials listed.  It was very hard deciding as there were so many things that sounded good.  The manager helped me decide on my entree the first night, and as I said, it was a remarkable dish.  The hostess called us the second night as we were on our way, saying they had a cancellation, and remembered we wanted an earlier time, saying we could come in sooner.  The manager brought our drink orders the second night simply from remembering what we had the night before.

I have never been made to feel so special at a restaurant as I was here.  Everything contributed to this, but the friendliness and great attitude of the staff is just remarkable.

And the prices are surprisingly low.  Our meal the second night came to $44!

They only have about seven tables, plus two high tops at the bar, a small space.  Reservations are needed.  It is a lovely place, with great atmosphere.

If we lived within an hour of JP's, we would be dining here every other week at least.  

The one really terrible thing about this place is that we have nothing like this at all where we are from.  We are stuck knowing there is such wonderful food and the experience not available to us.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

My mom was in town, so my wife and I wanted to take her out and try something new in the process.  All three if us were very happy with our experience.  To get started we all shared an order of crab meat stuffed mushroom as well as an order of muscles.  The muscles in particular were very good.  

Both my wife and I ordered the scallops with mushroom risotto and both of us loved it!  It's a heavy/rich meal so come with your appetite intact.  My mom got a seafood casserole from the specials board that she was a big fan of as well.  

Our server was great.  Enthusiastic and very knowledgable about the menu and specials.  Loved the cocktails, but if there was something to gripe about it was the seemingly excessive wait for cocktails to arrive after ordering.  

JP's is a pretty small space so reservations would be wise and where we were sitting it was pretty loud.  That doesn't bother me, but I know others feel differently.  

Overall, a great meal at very fair prices.  Will certainly be back.",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

The service was OK both times, although neither server seemed very knowledgeable or concerned about the menu proper.  There were, however, many specials and our server had some solid recommendations.

The food is Italian for the most part, and the chef certainly knows how to cook, even if the fare is a bit heavy on the stomach.  There is no real steak or pork chop on the menu to speak of, and there was a lack of creativity ingredient wise when I was there;  it was all very fresh.

The atmosphere is nice, the kitchen is active and the bar is quite large.  The wine list is adequate and served us nicely.

JP's is pretty pricey, but if you want to go somewhere off-peninsula for a quiet evening, you won't do much better elsewhere!  Give it a try!",4.5,2,"['496 Woodford St', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6690801,-70.3006566,"American (Traditional), Italian, "

Our server,  while attentive was easily distracted trying to keep up with the busy night. That being said she was very pleasant and informative.  We started with the short rib ravioli appetizer that was savory and just to die for with the ribs cooked perfectly and so tender it  they just melted in your mouth. Next were the pistachio mussels,  Prince Edward mussels prepared with pistachios,  white wine;  garlic and lemon. It was more than ample for the two of us and absolutely delicious especially with the pistachios. We then couldn't resist the seared scallops with mushroom and asparagus risotto. .sooooo smooth and creamy and the asparagus had just enough crunch left in it.  Lastly we topped it all of with tiramisu that was actually made by our server who freezes it right after she makes it which gives it a much more stable consistency and makes the filing almost like ice cream.

Asparagus was as limp as canned asparagus. In short nothing in this dish ""married"" into any flavor. Therefore it was nearly inedible for me. Stupidly I did not send the dish back. Finally near the end I did tell the nice server the dish was bland. There were guests sitting nearby so I didn't wish to cause a scene by telling more of the story of the dish.

They rival those made by 80-year-old Italian women. We've gotten those both times, as well as the short rib ravioli with short ribs and Gorgonzola - life changing. My husband's dish (some perfectly cooked seafood) and the meatballs were both ordered with the fra diavlo sauce -interesting enough for him and not too spicy for me!

I didn't really imagine our nice anniversary dinner being at the bar but we took it anyways because the food looked that good! When we were pulling up to the address I was a little surprised by the size and location, Very small and pretty much in a neighborhood a good 5-10 minute drive from downtown. We got our seats right away at the bar, which was very small but right in the window.

I travel to this area often for business and suggested to my coworker that we check out JP's based on rave reviews.  We asked a few of the employees at the hotel we stay at about it and they had never heard of it.  I pushed to check it out anyway.

Cuisine is Italian and their specials list is extensive and basically an entire separate menu.  Everything sounded salivatingly delicious.  Our server was very knowledgeable concerning the various dishes and was able to describe them in compelling ways.  So, it took us a while to decide.  After we had addictive warm bread with dill butter, we started with some salads.  The caprese salad was simple, fresh and all around amazing.  For my entree, I had an excellent seafood marinara fra diavolo.  It consisted of shrimp, scallops and other seafood on fresh linguine and covered in a delicious and perfectly spicy sauce.  Needless to say, I demolished it.  My coworker got blackened swordfish, which came out with a large array of colorful vegetables.  He also raved about his selection.  The food in general is nothing too adventurous, but it is all so well crafted and thoughtful.  Entrees are about $20 on average.

The drink selection seems well curated, there is a full bar and quite a few interesting special cocktails.  Quality wines and a good selection of local beers are available.

Atmosphere is also simple, with a kitchen separated from the dining room by a half-wall.  The lighting is low and there is an intimate feeling.  The service was good and the waiter, as I mentioned before, seemed very passionate and knowledgeable about the food itself.

Overall, we love this place! It's walking distance from our house and accomodates both our toddler and the palate quirks of both sides of our family (when they visit). I have a hard time ordering anything other than the steak, as they do such a good job of blue rare - going so far as to bring the sauce on the side so it doesn't cook the meat further (their idea, which I found to be very thoughtful). The salads are lovely. The menu isn't that impressive and seems really limited until you realize their specials menu is easily longer than their printed menu. If you catch them on a night when they have coconut cream pie, it's pretty darn decent and worth the calories. The staff is usually very friendly and remembers people, even if you only make it in once every few months. 

Rated 4 stars instead of 5 due to challenges getting a table, and lack of sound-dampening (quite hard to have a conversation at times).

Thrilled I persisted as dining experience for 3 of us was top-notch all-around. Hostess and wait staff (Terry) could not have been friendlier and more accommodating. Since hadn't been there since it was a different restaurant, didn't realize seating set-up or would have requested when making reservations not to be seated in bar at bistro tables. Hostess offered us outdoor seating instead which on 7/3 was delightful - much cooler than inside (one of the few nights w/o humidity). She easily turned what could have been an unpleasant situation into a positive and was so pleasant and professional about orchestrating the seating change. They were booked to capacity so we appreciated her efforts to satisfy us. Ended up being delightful outdoors on patio w 3 other tables. 

Terry, our waitress was fabulous. Don't know how she handled us all so efficiently and with a smile as everyone seemed to arrive at same time (also waited on inside tables). Appreciate Terry giving us her take on the many specials on the blackboard and describing ingredients and dishes to the tee. She really helped us make our decisions given it was our 1st time dining at JP's. Who needs a regular menu will the huge array of specials. After we had our appetizers, salads, and entrees, it was obvious that there weren't any wrong choices to make as everything was so delicious, incredible, and attractively displayed. Portions are very generous and everything was as fresh as could be. Only problem was we were too full to have desert, but will keep that in mind for next visit. Hat's off to the chef for his inventive cuisine (ravioli special w rib meat was to die for as was everything else).

Resident of Portland and eat dinner out regularly at the many fine restaurants nearby with friends and guests from out of town, but our experience at JP's was one of the best I've had in a long time.

6084,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6084,2019-02-18,"I went here with a party of 10 for myself and my two brothers birthday. I had great expectations for this place, the location is right on the water and actually rocks you back and forth like a baby going to sleep. Unfortunately this is probably the best part of the entire restaurant. 

It was a Saturday night and our waitress was very nice, but the service was slow. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the entire dinner (I shit you not) took three hours. Yes it's seafood, yes it was a Saturday night, yes we had a party of ten. But that is just unacceptable, when the waitress brought our food, everyone had a piece of garlic bread on the side of their plate (nobody's good included it so I assume that was to make up for the wait). This was nice, and arguably one of the best garlic breads I've had. However here is the problem: For 27 dollars for a 12 ounce cut of prime rib, you would expect some sort of vegetable, bread, some seasoned garnish or something. I've never been more disappointed receiving a 27 dollar meal. The cut of meat was cooked well, medium, but it was 20 percent fat, and unseasoned and bland. The au jus sauce tasted nothing better than hot water mixed with  a beef ramen flavoring packet, which you had to dunk into because the entire cut of meat was cold. Not lukewarm, cold to the touch of my tongue. Yes, the outside of the meat that was touching the pan while cooking. Now... maybe the sides would redeem this meal. I was optimistic. I ordered a loaded baked potato, and was excited to have a hot stuffed tater with cheese melting all over and bacon. Again, I shit you not, for 27 dollars they give you a potato (it was baked I'll give DiMillo's that) with chives mixed with sour cream, what looked like shredded mozzarella cheese that comes in the bag from market basket, and shredded bacon IN SEPARATE CUPS. Let me repeat that again, IN SEPARATE CUPS. Come on man, I'm sorry but I feel as if my wallet was raped that night. And my stomach. I cannot speak for any of the seafood, my brothers fianc√© got the Salmon and she really enjoyed it. 

In conclusion, if you love seafood and want to be comfortably rocked back and forth while you wait for two hours and then eat extremely overpriced sub par bland food, go to DiMillo's and eat yo heart out. Otherwise hit the damn super market, drizzle some lemon juice with garlic and salt & pepper over a 2 pound filet of your favorite fish, be happy your wallet hasn't been rigorously violated",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

Some minor things would make this a 5* in my book, but it shouldn't hold people back from going and experiencing this restaurant.  Our table ordered about 2-3 of each app.  The meatball had fresh mozzarella on it and was good.  The clams were good, but I found the mussels to be one of the stars of the night.  The broth goes great with the bread.  The crab cakes were good and I found the shrimp cocktails just a tad over cooked, but not too much.  I had the full stuffed 2.5lb lobster.  The stuffing wasn't something that I'd write home about because I was expecting some more texture to it...BUT the lobster was plentiful and prepared well.  I'll tell you the one star of the night was one I least expected - the lobster Mac and Cheese.  Very very tasty!  I looked at another tables order who had the scallops and they looked really good (we also had the bacon wrapped scallops and those were delicious). I was also happy that the server worked with someone I was with to create a custom vegetarian dish. Again, keep in mind that this is a good rating, but with areas to improve on to make it even better.  The IPA's on tap complimented the food nicely.

6088,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6088,2018-04-03,"My family (husband and two young teen boys) were visiting from Michigan, and we were looking forward to a lobster dinner on our last night in Portland. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on DiMillo's. 

There was no wait (Monday night) which was nice. The staff seemed bored and not very welcoming, but I wasn't upset by it at all. Our server was very slow to come to our table, and wasn't very attentive the entire meal. She did, however, take the time to explain how to break apart lobster (it was our first time eating it), which was nice. I wasn't too thrilled that she carded my husband for his drink but didn't card me! Haha, I'm 36 and my husband is 37. 

I ordered the seafood scampi and the rest of the family ordered lobster. The scampi was disappointing--I definitely would not recommend it. It didn't have much flavor at all, and needed salt. The scallops in the scampi were good, but the shrimp and lobster were over cooked. 

My family enjoyed trying lobster for the first time, but all agreed it was overrated. Certainly not worth $230! 

One thing that I really appreciated was that the owner came to our table and chatted with us for a couple of minutes. He was very kind.

The bar and overall decor was trendy. I liked the color scheme, and the funky wood grained tile flooring. Nice clean, young look.

I didn't order a cocktail, but read the numerous craft drink options. It looked great, and I'm sure that many young people are very attracted to this aspect of the restaurant. The wine menu has various predominantly Italian options by the glass and bottle. I'm a collector, but didn't recognize any of the producers. The Chianti and the Barbera that I tried were both decent, mildly fruity, low tannins and matched what we are for food. I did have a problem, however, with the price to value aspect of the wine scene. The wine pours here are modest at best, clearly at the very bottom range of a min 4 oz wine pour...for any wine regular, it's a clear under pour. 

The food was a bit mixed. The oysters were good, served with a nice prosecco, red wine vinegar, and shallot condiment. They were clean, fresh, plump, and tasty. The prosecco dipping was a good paring. The small plate roasted root veggies were also decent, Beets, turnip, carrots, sweet potato, and red onions, all nicely roasted in an olive oil and fresh herb mix. The small plate meatballs were interesting, clearly a nice ground beef and veal mixture, it had a very defined nutmeg accent. It had a nice ricotta or mascarpone cream side dip, which was nice. I liked the taste, but it wasn't universal with my guests. The spice rub chicken small plate was ok.....it had a real vinegar front forward taste, that didn't mesh with the nice creamy polenta it was served on...this was a bit of a miss in my eyes. The clear miss was the squid ink, sea urchin pasta dish, which I personally ordered. It was way over the top in both the uni factor, and I'm a big sushi and uni fan. It had Bottarga added to it, a spicy, salty fish row. The combination of the two was just an uni overload, highly rich and urchin tasting. This, coupled with a distinct Meyer lemon accent, just didn't do it for me. This was the most expensive dish on the menu, and was just over engineered in my eyes. Subtle uni on fresh squid pasta is an Italian delicacy....this just didn't do it. The table also ordered brick oven roasted little necks, with pancetta....but alas, the server forgot to place the order with the kitchen, and we got them comped, but in a take out container. No big deal there.

All in all, some ok things, but definitely some misses. Three stars, no more from this semi tough foodie. I'll try it again and give an update.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "

If you just want to take the kids for pizza, don't come here.  There are only four varieties, and one of them is cauliflower.  However, if you're looking for a unique dining experience away from the crowds in Old Port--and you don't care how much you pay--and you're not real hungry--you might try this place.  Once.

No complaints about the service.  Our party of five arrived early on a Saturday evening.  We had no reservations, but the hostess kindly seated us with the assurance that we'd be out by 7.  

After puzzling over the eclectic menu, my parents, sister and I decided to share several dishes.  Our waitress graciously accommodated our request, providing extra forks and clean plates when needed.

We started off with the complimentary house focaccia.  It was sprinkled with lemon zest--a nice touch.  The bread was followed by a salad of fresh greens with Parmesan and a light, tangy dressing.  Then we shared a small plate of luscious lamb ribs with a cherry-chili glaze.  Our main course was a pizza Margherita with a side of meatballs,  served in a little pot of ragu and topped with creamy ricotta cheese.  For dessert, we split a hazelnut chocolate tart and a little plate of zippoli.  Everything was delicious, especially the lamb ribs.

So why am I not giving five stars?  The portions were tiny!  Everything except the pizza and salad was the size of an appetizer, and a pretty small appetizer at that.  My husband--who was holding out for a lobster roll--ordered ceviche and a plate of pasta.  The scraps of fish in the ceviche were invisible, and the pasta was barely enough to feed a toddler.  The lamb ribs, meatballs, and chocolate tart also came in miniature portions.  I felt like I was at a doll's tea party!  Yet we were charged as much as if we were eating regular plates of food.  In Old Port.  With a couple of sodas, the meal averaged out to $30 per person.

I had the north spore mushroom ragu for brunch once too, which I found to be extremely tasty. They have a nice selection of pizzas as well. I prefer the classic margherita.

Showed up at 515 on a Saturday, they open at 4 and it was pretty busy. Was surprised to hear we had to wait 45 min for a table, but could be seated immediately at a communal table or wait for a spot at the bar. We opted for the communal table but quickly changed our mind and I'm glad we did because shortly after we decided to wait at the bar a large group of about 6 sat down, which would have been a bit awkward as a couple.
Standing at the bar was ok. There was a large group taking up a majority of the bar that seemed to just linger. We started ordering food and finally some spots opened up around  after an hour of waiting. 
Kept eating. Scallop crudo had a basil that really made the dish. Octupus was my favorite. Mushroom ragu had the best mushrooms. Pizza was great- I know they took a trip to Naples and while it was very good they have a ways to go before it compares to Naples. Cocktail/wine menu doesn't seem as extensive as Central Provisions.
Staff was extremely friendly. 
I would give Tipo 5* just based on the food, however I'm giving it 3 based on experience.

This was a bit disappointing in addition to the focaccia which was not as good as the meal and would have earned Tipo 5 stars. But our meals were super tasty as were the cocktails. Two of our diners raved about the pizza crust. The veg version of the mushroom ragu left me wishing I could lick my plate and dreaming of more polenta! Staff was informed, helpful, and happy.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "

We both like to try previously untried places but rarely agree on which one. This time however, we settled on Tipo within just a couple of minutes. 
We arrived just before 6 o'clock on a beautiful Saturday evening to find a surprisingly full restaurant to be informed that the next available table would be around 8 o'clock.... or we could ask the bar how long to wait to sit there. Thankfully it was only a few minutes before we took our spot at the bar (just enough time to order and receive our drinks). The menu had many interesting options so we decided to try a few of the small plates. 
We had marinated sardines, beef carpaccio, snapper cervice, meat balls, and crispy pesto potatoes, all of which were delicious and would order them all again... especially the sardines!
The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing (which I find extremely off putting). The restaurant itself is fresh and modern looking and I am happy we sat at the bar with a view of the chefs making the pizzas in the wood fired oven (we will try one of their interestingly topped pizzas on our next visit).",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "

We ordered some ""plates"" to start along with the table focaccia served.  I have pictures but some are of partially eaten plates.  I got too excited and ate before snapping some shots.  :) we also had a larger pasta dish and a pizza and everything was seasoned perfectly.  The black pepper tagliatelle was cooked perfectly and delicious in its simplicity.  The pizza was the most flavorful and delicious I can recall having in a very long time.  Delicious thin crust with perfect char.  And we tried both desserts which were equally sensational.  The zepoli were so fluffy and light  and the chocolate tart with hazelnuts, strawberries and cream was decadent.  I cannot imagine a thing a would change.  We will be going back since it was very reasonable for this caliber of food.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "

Our visit was Sunday, July 16, 2017.  It was Kayla's 30th birthday. Kay and I came in all giddy and happy because of her birthday.  We shared this with Ariel and she was such a sweetheart and guided us through the menu. It was a great experience and I can't wait to bring my guy and family here.  Love the time. Thank you Ariel.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "
6167,Bs3Xmofw54FOixxR3EMwpg,tipo,6167,2017-05-20,"My husband is obsessed with Central Provisions, so we had high expectations for Tipo (pronounced tee-poe, FYI). The wait wasn't long and the open concept was inviting. The service was phenomenal. Everyone was informative and helped each other out. They seemed to genuinely love their jobs. The concept is the same as Central, in that they excel at small plates. We had the beef carpaccio, hand-pulled mozarella, meatballs with gravy, mushroom ragu, and crispy local potatoes. We enjoyed everything, some more than others. The ragu was out of this world. I'm not even sure how they made the gravy, but it blended perfectly with the truffle egg yolks and polenta. The potatoes were crispy as promised, but we weren't fans of the combination of pesto with lemon on top. The flavors did not blend- but the goat cheese had a perfect consistency. And you have to appreciate chefs who think outside the box. Overall a pleasant experience. I think Tipo would be great for lunch, so we're planning on going back in a few weeks.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "
6168,Bs3Xmofw54FOixxR3EMwpg,tipo,6168,2017-03-08,"I'm hesitant to write this review because while I love this place, I don't want it to get crazy popular and never be able to get in...which is kind of already the situation on weekend nights. The parking is tricky, they have a small lot and then there's street parking which can be difficult to come by. But once you are in and seated, the space, the food, and the service are all delightful. Here's what I like:
This is accessible for kids. It's spacious, inviting, and the menu is diverse but not over complicated. The service is great. Everyone is friendly and fun. They have a small but great cocktail and wine list. The food is consistent and excellent. I'm assuming that the menu will change with the seasons, but the last 3 times I've been there, the menu has been the same. I'm not complaining because I've loved everything I've tried. Here's what I've had-oysters, mozzarella, scallop crudo, grilled octopus, & spiced rubbed chicken. My husband has had several of the pastas (he loves the one with the apricots), beef carpaccio, and my son loves the pizza. This place is a happy spot and it will bring you joy. Also, make sure that you eat the dehydrated candied orange or lemon that you get in your drink because they are delicious. I want a plateful of them to finish my meal.",4.0,2,"['182 Ocean Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6775012459286,-70.2811227700895,"Pizza, Italian, Bars, Cocktail Bars, "
