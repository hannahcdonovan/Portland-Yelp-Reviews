0,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,0,2019-04-13,"WOW. Street & Co is certainly the spot for romantics! It's cozy, and I love that the kitchen has an open concept. It feels like you have your own personal chefs for the night. 

We ordered the Lobster Diavolo, which comes with a whole lobster split in half, tons of clams, mussels, a sprinkle of squid all served on top of a bed of pasta with flavorful, spicy tomato sauce. IT WAS AH-MAZING. I can't even. When I moved to Maine, THIS WAS EXACTLY what I was looking for when I envisioned seafood galore! 

Also, they serve unlimited butter and bread!",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

All of this made us so excited for dinner. We ordered blackened char and the scallops pernod. And when they came out, our eyes were bright and our mouths were watering. But then we tasted the food and it was just overpowering with saltiness. Everything was wayyyy or a bit too salty. We scraped all the seasoning off the artic char and it was still too salty. Not to mention the greens. A bummer, since we were so excited to visit this spot from out of town. 

The service was also great. We were just disappointed by the main event. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing...

5,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,5,2018-11-04,"This review is from Thursday, Oct 18, 2018.

How fortunate we were to have this restaurant in walking distance of our hotel.  The valet recommended this location and show did my cell recommendations.  We couldn't find a park, so we drove our car back to the hotel and took a walk.  This place was packed.  The people we were in line behind, said they had reservations, we did not.  We were seated in the bar area and spoke to a couple who currently reside in Colorado, but stated that they have been to this restaurant many times because they love it.  He went on to state that he got reservations the moment they were opened up. Ok.  This place should be good.  Long lines, reservations and a wonderful aroma.

We ended up waiting about thirty minutes for our table, but it was so worth it.  Our order was put in right away and we nibbled on some of their bread while we waited for our meal.

The Grilled Lobster on Linguine, Butter and Garlic was superb.  This meal was well worth the $39.95.  Please see the picture showing how I devoured it.  My dinner mate opted for the ahi tuna with broccolini in a pesto sauce and some roasted red potatoes.  I don't do raw fish (just slightly cooked on the outside and raw in the inside), so I can't say how her fish tasted (she really enjoyed it), but the broccolini was delicious.  It just had a hint of pesto and lemon.  Very tasty.  

Here's What I Think...I want to go back to Maine, just so I can enjoy this meal again.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

They had their lobster diavalo since the pictures from others looks so epic, and I can confirm it is indeed epic! The pasta was super tasty, the seafood in it had so much flavor, and if was massive! Definitely the thing to order for a hungry group. 
We also got the garlic shrimp pasta, which was heavenly and tasted amazing, definitely recommended. The pasta with scallops and affredo sauce was not too good though, it's on the heavy side with way too much cream and cheese, but that's what it is supposed to be so can't complain there, should have gotten their pan seared scallop dish instead.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
8,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,8,2018-08-22,"When in Maine... one must eat lobster!?! This restaurant is hidden away in a cobblestone alleyway. The lines are quite long, and it took us an hour to get in for dinner without a reservation. It was worth it. Inside, it looks like a food cellar in colonial times with all the vegetables hanging from the celings.

For the food, I split a bunch of dishes with my friends since the serving sizes are quite large. The lobster bread pudding for an appetizer was so rich and definitely a pleasant surprise. Typically, I thought bread puddings were supposed to be sweet desserts. This was really well balanced and there are chunks of lobster that, combined with the vegetables, cheese, and bread pudding, made for a really good mouth feel that was packed with flavor.

The main dish was the lobster diavolo for 2. Technically, I probably could have eaten this type of dish in Boston at some place supposedly called Giacomo's. I'll have to update my review when I actually go there to compare. The sauce is really good, which is a tomato based sauce that probably has white wine and herbs. It has all the juices of the mussels, lobsters, clams, and calamari. There is so much pasta beneath the seafood. If you have the stomach for it, make sure to order extra bread to dip into the sauce! To be honest, for normal people, this dish could probably be split with 3-4 people.

Our other friends got some pastas and we ended up trading some of our dish to get theirs. One was the Scallops in Pernod and Cream pasta, and it comes inside the pan they cook it in?!? The white sauce is really delicious, and the scallops are tender and quite big. I think I stole a lot of those..heheh. The other pasta was the Shrimp with Butter and Garlic linguine. This dish was also quite good, but I didn't have time to eat much because it disappeared so fast. It's very buttery, and the shrimps were pretty fresh. Again, the sauce is so good on all of these pastas that you just have to soak it up in bread, gluten-free critics and low carb diets be damned.

Somehow we made room for dessert. On our way to the tables, I could see the pies sitting out in the kitchen and they looked so good. Maine is probably famous for blueberries, but I decided to get a pecan pie, They heat it up in the oven and you can get it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Really decadent way to close out the probably 100000 calorie meal we just consumed. 

The service here is excellent, and they even give you warm towels with lemon if you eat any of the lobsters since it can get messy cracking open the shells.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
9,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,9,2018-09-17,"Follow the wisdom of the crowds here and just get the Lobster Fra Diavolo for two. Trust me.

The other dishes are solid and don't quite justify the price point, but all that is forgiven again by how excellent the Fra Diavolo is both in price and in quality.

But oh yeah, don't skip dessert. The bourbon pecan pie was one of the most balanced takes on the sweet I've had to date- not overly sweet or gloopy. Do yourself a favor and add a scoop of ice cream to round it all out.",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "

12,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,12,2019-02-07,"Went in January and there were only two reservation options open: first seating or last. We decided on an early dinner and headed over. It was right next to or hotel so we arrived before they started seating. The bartender was very friendly. He talked about a new cocktail he was working on that wasn't on the menu yet. It sounded good so we acted as guinea pigs for him- it was good, very good.

The dining room has a nice cozy feel. We were seated next to a group of guys who were discussing plans for opening a summer camp and it was a great conversation to eavesdrop on.

For appetizers we had grilled octopus and a simple salad. Both were excellent. I had blackened char for my entree and my wife had lobster with linguine. My fish was cooked perfectly and the side of potatoes and broccolini were great. Hers came with an entire split, grilled lobster and once we shucked that bad boy it was delicious in the garlicky sauce. Made good leftovers for when we got home too!

All and all this might have been the food highlight of our trip to Portland (maybe a tie with central provisions).

WOW. 
It was a bit pricey... but so worth it. Split between 2 people, we were left super full and satisfied. 
The bread they also give in the beginning is really good. I always make the mistake of eating too much of it.. but worth it.
The seafood pasta with lobster on top was amazing. They did not skimp out on the seafood. So many mussels and clams. All the seafood tasted fresh too. My only complaint is that the some parts of the lobster meat was watery/mushy. 

Also, it's $70 for this dish FYI (not $50 as it says on yelp haha)

Walking into the restaurant from the cobblestone streets was in itself delightful! My boyfriend's buddy recommended this place to us when we took a weekend get-a-away together. Unfortunately, it was back in November and I can not list what my boyfriend and I ordered because we both ordered the specials of the night! (See pictures below)

I can vouch that both meals were absolutely delicious! My fish was cooked perfectly! So creamy, super moist, and its meaty texture satisfied my appetite.

The service was exceptional. Our waitress made sure we had everything we needed and could not have been more helpful in listing all the ingredients so we were aware of what was in the food. There were so many great options it was hard to choose from.

Per previous reviews, anticipate approximately an hour wait. It was definitely worth the wait! My boyfriend and I came here and only ordered the Lobster Diavolo for 2, approximately ~60. It's a huge pot of linguini with mussels, clams, calamari, and a lobster. This was the ONLY thing we ordered, no bread, no appetizer, nada, and we were full out of our minds. This dish alone was enough for dinner and lunch the next day! The linguine was cooked perfectly. The seafood was fresh. The lobster meat was so tender. The dish was a teeny bit spicy, but overall, awesome taste and deal! 

We never skip on dessert, so we ordered panna cotta and the strawberry rhubarb pie, a la mode. I would 1000% advise you to order the rhubarb pie. The crust is made of cornmeal, but it was crumbly, warm, and buttery and absolutely awesome with ice cream and the tart, sweet, strawberry rhubarb filling.

It is delicious indeed and full of flavor. It's honestly a pound of pasta and generous amounts of seafood (clams, squid, mussels and a whole lobster).
They had a crabmeat mushroom pasta appetizer that evening that I found to be far superior to the lobster dish. It's a different flavor profile (not dosed in heavy handed garlic or tomato...phew) which I enjoyed far more. I wish I ordered a double portion for dinner.
I've had their scallops in Pernod cream in the past, delicious but the sides are so uninspiring. And I remember the grain (farro) was a bit underdone to my liking. For the cost of these dishes ($30+) I expect a bit more for the accompaniments to a seafood plate than a spoonful of whatever grain cooked en masse and a vegetable.

For our entree, we decided on the clam linguine with white sauce. Although we enjoyed it, I would recommend trying something with a red or Alfredo sauce if you plan to get the mussels.

43,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,43,2018-05-07,"My husband planned an incredible birthday weekend for me, filled with good seafood in Portland, ME.  It's hard to go wrong in this town because everything is so food-esque and chef-y but Street and Co. is definitely the best.  It's a good experience, with a lively atmosphere, open kitchen, friendly service. Prices are also decent for the portion of food you get... 

Of course we got the famed lobster diavolo ($60), and honestly it says it feeds two but you could probably fee 3 or 4. We're pigs so the server said we had ""above average consumption"" **sheepish** but honestly, all the elements were very tasty so it's hard to put down. You get: 

- A full lobster, which was fresh and well done. They crack some of it for you but you still have to do some work. The server was great about refilling our bowl for shells, etc. 
-Linguine pasta in a yummy spicy tomato sauce, arribata style 
-Tons and tons of fresh clams, mussels (meaty!), and calamari (the worst and the least)

A filling, delicious meal. 

We also tried some of the ""tastes"" which were craft little bites, creatively done. Among them, a cooked tuna dolma (stuffed grape leaf) with dirty rice - my fave. Halibut salad stuffed in a red piqullo pepper, and the Arctic Char type of deviled egg. Which was actually yummy considering I don't love deviled eggs. 

For drinks, my hubby had a local beer, and two cocktails - 1) the cocchi which was a bubbly processco type of refreshing cocktail, and 2) the Night Out which was a boozy martini type drink with savignon blanc. This was a pretty boozy cocktail. 

For dessert, we shared a light, airy Greek Yogurt Cake. It came with citrus notes, and pistachio. It's not everyone's cup of tea- quite light and perhaps tarte but I don't like really sweet desserts so it was perfect for me. They put a nice candle on it for me since it was my birthday and gave plenty of well wishes along the way.

For dinner I got the lobster with linguine. The lobster was delicious as expected and the linguine was great but I thought it had too much garlic in it. Towards the end of it I was trying to get the last few strands of linguine and was just getting full scoops of chopped garlic.

45,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,45,2018-07-14,"Street & Co is a member of the family of restaurants that include Fore Street and Scales and after a great dinner at Fore we gave it a whirl.

Upon entering the joint I was immediately cramped... not just because of the amount of people (it's very popular) but also because of the low ceilings and crammed layout.  As we waited for our table we ordered drinks in the lounge area which did not have a bar, rather various low tables and peripheral seating against a wall.  Somehow we found a couple is chairs on the periphery while we sipped our drinks but it was hard to relax as I constantly had to re adjust to let others pass as their tables were ready.  When our table came up we were ushered to a twofer against a brick wall, which I actually welcomed since that meant that there would be no traffic to one side.  I know I'm harping on this as it should be about the food, but it's important to mention that if you are not in to continuous bustle and the related acoustic cacophony heightened by wood-beamed low ceilings this is not a good choice for dinner.  Romance will not be had here!  On several table passes, various diners kept bumping our roasting pans that housed are mains as the handles extended out a bit.  Ugh!!  But on to the food:

Our starters were good-- the octopus was tender enough and maybe under-spiced and I missed the crunchy char that is often a highlight of this dish.  The Manchego membrillo starter would have been better for dessert as the combo of the paste with a fig cake created a sweetness imbalance with the cheese.  My fault though, so no big deal.  The heirloom tomato salad was the best of the three as the produce was amazingly fresh and not eclipsed by an overbearing dressing.  Maybe the olives were house cured or so they seemed!

The whole fish Branzino came atop a braised kale and mushroom base with a balsamic broth that paired perfectly with the white flesh of the fish.  I'm not usually a fan of white flaky anything in the fish camp but they nailed this treatment on the flavor spectrum.  The shrimp came atop a scampi like ""white sauced"" linguini and it was expectedly rich, decadent and teeming with roasted garlic and julienned basil.  The shrimp was sadly a tad over-done which made it dense and a bit chewy instead of that ""pop"" one gets when it's cooked to perfection.  My wife and I both thought the sauce had some other element that made the dish denser like ground pine nuts etc.... when we asked our serve said it was just garlic that was roasted..... I'm still not buying it though as this dish is one of my own specialties and garlic doesn't get to that denseness unless toasted to a golden color.

We paired the meal with a 2013 Sancerre which was a great choice if I do say so myself!

And thus I'll end by saying that it was a decent meal, not spectacular, and the ambience was aggravating.  Oh and our clothes smelled of the place long after leaving.  Fore St was better on all levels.

The great was the food and ambiance.  Excellent and I'd give it 5 stars.  
The bad, and I mean bad, was the blond hostess who just couldn't be more unpleasant and unwelcoming.  Completely lacking the ability to smile or get a greeting out of her mouth.  She acted as though she was doing everyone a huge favor to allow them to eat there.  

And it wasn't just us that she was unpleasant to, we were waiting to be seated when three other couples arrived for their reservation and she treated them like they were annoying her.  One of the couples actually asked us what her problem was!   I also saw her delivering some of the food to a few tables later on and she put them down on the tables as though it was beneath her to deliver food.  No smile, no words, just dropping the plates with a cold face and walking away. 

Maybe she was the owner's wife because it's impossible to understand any other circumstance which would put such a cold and unfriendly person in that position.  She's the first impression and trust me when I tell you, it's not a good one.
  
Normally I wouldn't bother mentioning a hostess, unless I had something great to say, and it pains me to reduce this rating to 3 stars because of one person but she really was a such an immediate and complete negative from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  

When we left, I said goodbye to her just to see if she would even respond at all.  She didn't.  

Anyway, the food was incredible.  Grilled octopus appetizer, tuna appetizer with oil and salt, freshly grilled halibut to perfection.

60,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,60,2018-04-06,"Note: a huge portion of this 5 star review is due to the heavy garlic usage in both dishes we had - I am garlic obsessed and would not recommend Street & Co. to anyone that is sensitive or has an aversion to garlic.

After reading rave Yelp reviews of the Lobster Diavolo, I knew that I had to come here for dinner. The stars aligned and when we walked in, two seats opened up at the bar and we were able to sit right down! The ambiance in the bar/lounge area is a bit different than the rest of the restaurant and I'd actually recommend the bar over the dining room if possible. The rest of the restaurant was crowded and the lighting was much brighter - whereas in the bar area, it felt much cozier. 

FOOD: 
We ordered the Mussels Provencal to start which were delicious. Big, juicy mussels with a garlicky broth - for $13.95 it was a huge portion that actually left us more full than anticipated. For our main course, we split the Lobster Diavolo which was unreal. The pictures are deceptive - my husband and I pride ourselves on being able to eat a lot (seafood in particular) and we were unable to finish this dish. Two lobster tails, clams, mussels, and calamari all on top of a huge serving of pasta. Again, very garlicky but oh so delicious. Perhaps if we hadn't started with a huge appetizer of mussels, we'd have been able to eat more of it. 

All in all, our experience here was fantastic. The amount of seafood you get for the price is absolutely unheard of in Boston. The value and garlic made it a 5 star win for me and I'll most definitely be trying to come back when I'm in Portland again!",4.5,3,"['33 Wharf St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6558679491282,-70.2540271729231,"American (New), Seafood, Mediterranean, "
61,rJsGrKPoRHcGadwy0F1lzA,street-&-co.,61,2018-02-25,"Finally  I managed to hit up this place at 2nd attempt!

My 1st attempt coming here was cancelled since there was 45 minute wait without reservation and I was too HANGRY to wait..haha

On my 2nd attempt, after learning from the 1st experience, I decided to make reservation to avoid similar outcome during one of my dinners. My friends and I who all were visiting from NY were seated immediately. I immediately noticed the open kitchen concept, where I was able to see how the food was prepared. The place smelled so good from all the butter/spices/aromatics that constantly came from the kitchen..mm hmm.

So we shared the lobster fra diavolo and scallop with cream sauce. And finished off the meal with Bourbon pecan pie a la mode. The scallop dish unfortunately for me was so so. I remembered it came with some kind of 
farro it somehow did not soak up the creamy flavor. The scallop was okay, a little much smaller in size and not many of it in the pan. Not sure it worth the price tag. The lobster fra diavolo meanwhile was awesome. It's got rich tomato based flavor sauce and loaded with seafood. Definitely sharable even for 3 people.  We even managed to still clean up the leftover sauce with bread. The A la mode pecan pie was perrrfect. Warm bourbon infused pie meets cold ice cream. Perfect ending to the meal.
All in all, a little pricey meal (but then everybody knows that vacation is NOT the time to save money) but it was a great experience.

Great place to eat for an out of town visitors! Or catch up with friends/ date. Remember: ALWAYS make reservation. Reservation seems to be the norm for restaurants in Portland generally otherwise be prepared to wait for a while! (READ: Eternity)

As for as I know, they have three rooms in restaurant: one is a bar, the middle is for walk-in customers, and the last room is for reservations. The bar is just a lounge area for drinks and maybe small snacks. The walk-in section and the reservation area looked the same except the open kitchen is part of walk-in section so all the smoke filled that room up. We didn't really mind.

My husband and I chose to sit at the bar for dinner. We were greeted by a women who waited on us part of the time with some younger guys, too, that were working behind the bar. We had a bottle of Pinot noir and shared tastes and small plates. Since my husband doesn't do oysters, I had a half dozen myself. They were served with a mignonette. The oysters served were on the smaller side. I like horseradish or Tabasco with my oysters and neither came with or were offered. The three tastes we had were the goat cheese with pea purée & cracker; manchego with fig cake; and crispy jamon with fiddleheads. All were just a taste, really not a shareable dish. So taste means just that - a bite. This is not a complaint but more informative for you to make your ordering decisions. The goat cheese and that pea purée was just delicious. It was surprisingly not a soft goat cheese. The fig cake served with the manchego was the bomb...we loved it!  The manchego was easily shared as there were a few pieces of cheese. The crispy jamon was very crispy. It was so small that it really was just enough for one person to pop in their mouth. The accompanying fiddleheads were so dressed with vinegar that I choked upon tasting them. Next we ordered the mussels and the calamari appetizers. Both were so good! The mussels were large in size and plentiful. The flavorful broth was sopped up with crusty bread...yum. The calamari came in a tomato sauce. This also was a good-sized portion and tasty. Both fish dishes were plenty to share between the two of us. Overall, we really enjoyed our dining experience.

Interesting seafood restaurant, however might be overhyped.

---

Eventide is one of the great seafood establishments in Portland (now with even outposts in Boston!) so we knew we had to stop by on our way back from Acadia. 

The wait was pretty crazy as we were quoted a wait of about an hour for a party of 2 on a Sunday evening at 6 PM. 

We ordered a large sampling of their main offerings -- here's what we thought:

1. Their oysters are served very creatively here with flavored ice as the accouterments - we tried the horseradish and red onion ices, and I like how the ices add a crisp pop of flavor to the oyster without weighing it down. I have never seen this before elsewhere and it's a great idea.

2. The lobster stew, while interesting, was much too salty. Would have probably just enjoyed a standard lobster bisque rather than this creative approach.

3. The buns/rolls here are served on the equivalent of Chinese steamed baos, which is a very interesting take on the classic lobster roll. In general, I did think the baos work pretty well in this setting, as it's fluffier and lighter compared to bread. The toppings themselves though were nothing special to write home about. 

4. We also ordered a seasonal scallop ""okonomiyaki"" which is their take on the Japanese savory pancake, and this was a huge flop. They probably should have taste-tasted this a bit more rigorously but every single element of this dish was salty, which, when combined, simply made for a salty mess.

Overall, we had a decent meal. Although everything was generally adequate, nothing really stood out on its own. When passing through Portland again next time, I would probably think twice about stopping in here again -- especially with waits up to an hour!",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

106,4pLOc-hETcvopT20h_6A9w,eventide-oyster-company,106,2019-04-14,"I'm torn about Eventide.  Yes, it was interesting, but I just did not enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I was going to.

The best part of this meal were the oysters.  They have many varieties of Maine oysters and also some from other parts of North America.  The best part was that you get to choose two accoutrements and many of the choices are actually ice.  So essentially you can top your oyster with a flavored shaved ice, which gives the oyster a really nice burst of flavor.  I went with the red onion ice and the horseradish ice, both of which were great.  The oysters were well shucked and seemed fresh.  As an oyster bar, Eventide gets full marks.

Unfortunately the rest of the meal gradually became less and less successful.  The well-touted lobster roll with browned butter was decent, but not worth the $15 price.  They use a house-made Asian bao sort of bread shaped into a lobster roll form.  And there's lobster on top.  It was okay.  The lobster seemed a bit chewy to me and it was messy to eat since the lobster isn't really sandwiched inside the roll, so it starts to fall off the bun as you eat.  The bao bread also robbed the lobster roll of some much needed crunch and was just soft.

The New England clam bake is visually appealing, but was one of the few things I ate this trip that I would not order again.  Part of the problem was that the steamers were SO SO gritty.  Yes, I do understand there is no way to rid the steamers of grit and sand, but I have never seen so much grit in a steamer before.  By the end of the meal, my napkin looked like I had dragged it through the beach and my hands were covered in dirt.  No, it wasn't just a little bit.  I was literally wiping caked on dirt for each steamer.  The mussels were okay, although some of the smaller ones became overcooked.  I did enjoy the hard boiled egg and the salt pork.  Now the big problem.  The lobster tail, the crown jewel of Maine, was completely overcooked.  It was difficult to remove from the shell and was just rubbery.  Maybe it's difficult to time all these items to steam together.  Maybe the lobster tail needs to be added partway through the steaming.  I had saved the lobster tail for the end and it was an unfortunate last few bites.  I was going to give Eventide three stars, but finally dropped them to two stars because the lobster was so overcooked.

I'm also not the biggest fan of the vibe here.  It seems very cold and sterile.  Yes, part of it is that it's a raw bar and yes, I did get shaved ice to top my oyster.  But everything from the service to the decorations to the food just seemed cold.  This is a stark contrast to my dinner the night before at Central Provisions where I felt so cared for and the food was so heartfelt.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "
107,4pLOc-hETcvopT20h_6A9w,eventide-oyster-company,107,2019-03-06,"Everyone says you gotta try Eventide. So I did. It was good. I came for lunch on a weekday and had no problem being seated at the bar. 

Service was quick and good. But what do I know? It feels unfair to judge a place that's noted for being slammed based on a time when I'm one of three customers. Service had better be good when it's that empty. (It filled while I was eating.)

They have a lot of non-alcoholic drinks. (I like options!) I was there for lunch and going back to work so I opted for a light non-sweetened lemon soda on ice. It was perfect with the food, celebratory without being dulling. They served it with a paper straw. Yay environment!

Food. I had to get the brown butter lobster roll ($15). It's not at all a traditional lobster roll. Instead, they toss lobster in brown butter with sage and put it on a bao bun. The one I ate (with a knife and fork -- there seems to be no other way) was delicious. The bun was warm, as though they'd cooked it to order. The lobster was good. Would I eat it again? Sure. Am I craving it? No. Will I try it at home? Perhaps.

I also got a half-dozen oysters ($16) (3 different kinds) with shaved horseradish. They were clean and very cold (which I guess keeps them fresh but it's not my preference -- I like to taste them. I feel like the cold mutes the taste). They were full of brine and perfectly shucked. I could have eaten more but didn't need to. I was full. So, yay, food! 

Atmosphere is chilly -- metaphorically, not actually. The bar is cement, the stools are backless, and as at least one other reviewer said, it feels a little tight. Thankfully there was no one beside me. It's beautiful, sure, and these are little dings for a place that is consistently good and was for my visit. I'd like to try more of their menu.

The cherry on top was as we sat down and FINALLY ready to order they said their out of the New England Clam Bake which was the only reason why we decided to wait that long.

Why weren't we told when putting the name on the list? Or when we were handed menus to look while we waited another 30 minutes before actually being seats.

We all got the New England Clam Chowder and the general consensus was it was bland, too much potato, and underwhelming. The mussel dish only had seven pieces and tons of potatoes though. The special boiled black cod was drowning in overly salted miso sauce which made you drink tons of water afterwards.

The ambience is very loud and your pretty much yelling at your waiters and friends because the music is blasting, and the seating is strange and uncomfortable.

The strange thing was the soup was watery thin. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was unexpected as I thought I would get a nice thick chowder to slurp on. 

We also got the beet salad which I would come back for. It was drizzled with Szechuan chili oil, which was unique and somehow just worked very well with the sweetness of the beets. Honestly just a genius idea!",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

We went early on a Saturday night to put our name in. They take your phone number. There's a wait list you can click when they text you so you can see what number you are. There's plenty of places close by to grab a drink.

Food. Brown butter lobster roll. Just get it. It's small, but delicious. $15. Not your traditional New England lobster roll. The crab roll was also very good. Came on the same bun as the lobster roll, again very small. The clam bake was also great. I think it was like $34 and came with mussels, steamers (clams), piece of pork belly and some potatoes. Flavor was great. We also got the cod cheek special which was tempura fried. The fish itself was so flavorful. The lobster bisque was again not traditional. Had a smoky flavor.

We got a tray of oysters to share. You can choose the type of flavored ice to pair it with, which was great. I recommend the purple one - I think it's onion? It was a little sweet and very refreshing.

I also got the clam chowder, lobster roll and tuna tartare. All were absolutely delightful. The clam chowder isn't thick like it normally is in New England, but I like this soupy texture better. It was so flavorful - the seaweed added a unique kick that I loved. It comes with these amazing crackers that I really wanted to know where they got it from. I could eat it all day. The lobster roll was buttery soft. The bun almost melts in your mouth, and the lobster filling was so rich it overwhelmed my taste buds and had me relishing every bite.

I tried 3 dishes-the Maine lobster stew, the eventide brown butter lobster roll, and the scallop waffle-yaki-as well as a handful of oysters. 

The lobster stew was delicious. It's very salty and buttery, and has a heap of lobster in it. The saltines that come with the soup are also really satisfying. The lobster roll was great as well, very soft with really fresh tasting lobster. The scallop waffle-yaki was kinda strange. It tasted fine, very much like takoyaki, but was just kinda a weird thing to eat. It's greasy and messy. It's the only thing that I might say pass on.

The oysters (pine point, John's River, and Harraseeket) were all very nice and clean. My personal favorite were the John's River.

I don't know what it was about this place but it just really hit home. It is not a traditional clam chowder though. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was kind of surprised when it came out because it had some green oils in it... but wow! Everything in there complemented each other. From the clams to the potatoes to the seaweed. I just loved it. We came back three times in the five days we were there. 

Raw bar- fresh fresh fresh! there were so many options for us to choose from. I seriously wanted to try one of everything because all of the food was so fresh. I have never had oysters this fresh. In California, we get a lot of them imported, so I was ecstatic when I could eat it fresh from Maine. Yes, I know it seems silly. 

I do have a bone to pick with the lobster roll though. I am not docking a star because it still tasted amazing. The lobster roll was ridiculously small.  I am comparing it to the other lobster rolls in the area that are practically vomiting lobster out of the bread. The roll at Eventide is mostly bread with a couple pieces of lobster stuffed in it. For the price I was paying, I would have rather gone to Bite Into Maine.

Fried oysters were also delicious! Portions were extremely tiny, but it was good.

The highest rated restaurant in Portland has to be a stop and at over 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars, Eventide has some work to do. As a foodie, I strongly believe 3 elements make a dining experience great. Food, decor, and service.

Decor: kind of cozy. There's a nice open seafood bar right when you walk in and you can see all the chefs shucking oysters.

The food: everything was delicious here, I'm not gonna lie. The oysters were super fresh and the shells clean. These may have been the best oysters I've ever had. The lobster roll was super tasty too. It was buttered and just the right amount of crispy. The lobster bisque had some good chunks of lobster. The swordfish was heavenly, it melted right on the tongue. l wanted to give this place 5 stars just for the food but service.

The service: we had to wait a good amount (40min) for a saturday night. It would be longer but we opted for the standing shelf seats near the bathroom. Getting our order in was no problem. We received our oysters and here's where things went south. As people entered and left, we did not receive our order for over an hour even though we saw our waitress and she assured us it was coming out. Finally we hailed down another waiter and after asking him, it appeared our order never got put through even though we ordered the oysters and main courses at the same time. The waiter was nice enough to comp us some dill chips and a slice of moose pie but our dinner took 3 hours and we drove all the way up to Maine and had only 2 days. So our night was done after dinner. 

What a disappointment.

130,4pLOc-hETcvopT20h_6A9w,eventide-oyster-company,130,2018-10-22,"Eventide is one of those staple restaurants in Portland. When tourists are in town, Eventide is one of those prominent establishments that people flock to for lunch and dinner, on any given day of the week. As you pass by the restaurant at all hours, there is always a distinguished line out the door waiting to get their hands on an Eventide bite.

I ended up coming to Eventide for the first time on a Wednesday evening. After living in Portland for about a year, I figured I eventually would have to try out Eventide myself and check out the hype. The typical line out the door to put in your name was still prevalent, and my friends and I waited for about 20 minutes before we could even put our name in. Once we got to the host, we were told the wait was going to be an hour and a half long. We put in our name, they took our number, and we were told that they would text us when our table was ready. 

Their timing was pretty spot on as we got a text right at the hour and a half mark. We went to the host and we were quickly seated by the window outlooking the street. Our waiter came to greet us, who was extremely nice and sincere and took our drink order. I ended up getting the GT Cooler which had gin, cucumber, sake, and lemon soda. It was incredibly refreshing and had a good gin kick to it. 

For food, I ordered the famous lobster roll which I had heard great things about, and I got a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw was okay. It had a lot of horseradish to it and it was very, very wet. It was almost soup-like. The lobster roll was nicely seasoned and the bread was nice and fluffy...but it's extremely small. It tasted great, but is it worth the price? I don't think it is. 

Again our waiter was extremely kind and brought us a complimentary tuna crudo, which was fresh and really, really good. The service was truly great, the food was good, I just don't think the portions measure up to the price value. Would I bring friends visiting? Maybe? Would I specifically think to go here on a casual dine night? No. Would I go here on a date? Maybe? I just think it has a great deal of hype...but it's not my favorite spot in the Portland food scene.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

Even if you have a picky eater with you, you should check this place out because they have a burger and fried chicken sandwich on the menu for the non-seafood lovers.

The food here is amazing. Must haves are the lobster stew (my favorite thing I tried) and the oysters (duh!). The lobster stew had sooo much lobster in it and had a really interesting curry flavor. You could tell this came right out because it was super hot, which I love! I'm not that knowledgable about oysters even though I eat them fairly often, but our waiter was very helpful in choosing some for us. For sauces, I tried the red wine mignonette, Kimchee ice and red onion ice. They were all great and I'd recommend them all.

I also tried the lobster roll which was delicious! It came on an Asian style bao-type bun, which was interesting. I'd also recommend the cold scallops appetizer (raw scallops with shaved Brussels sprouts). The scallops were amazing but I think the Brussels were a little too salty/miso-y for my taste.

The one negative about this place is how crazy crowded it is all the time. If you prefer going somewhere for a lengthy, relaxing meal - this isn't your place. The hostess seemed very frazzled/overwhelmed and even though we arrived at 11:20 (20 mins after opening on a Saturday), we had to wait about 20 mins.

I got a Maine ginger beer (non alcoholic) and my s.o. got a mezcal cocktail (forget the name) that the server warned us was really strong and not that great (she was right). Others at the table loved their celery martinis. 

The oysters were fantastic. The lobster roll was very tasty and I get it's all about the artistic nature, but I have a hard time dropping $15 on two bites of food, even if it is delicious. 

The clam chowder, however, was really unappetizing. It was not very creamy and was overpowered by the wakame slices. It tasted very much like hot seaweed milk with potatoes and few clams, if any. It was a real disappointment. 

Service was stellar. The oyster shooters were tempting. A companion's fried chicken sandwich was a surprising normal-sized portion.

Well, I can safely say I made the right choice!

To start off I had some oysters. While I don't know if there was some kind of ""oyster repository"" in the back, having fresh oysters always added to the pile, and having them right in front of you really reinforced the freshness.  I don't know the first thing about oysters, so I told my server to ""surprise me"".Again, I don't know the first thing about oysters, but the ones my server surprise me with were strong enough to have flavor, but in my opinion not too intimidating.  a good assortment.

For the main course, I had myself the much applauded, very delicious, but somewhat undersized lobster roll. First, you have to start with the delicious bun,  So soft and gentle, without distracting from the texture and flavor of the main event.  the brown butter was amazing, it tied everything together really well adding that silky, and for lack of a better word ""buttery"" flavor. Finally, there's the all-important lobster!  it was very tender, very flavorful, and Kurt perfectly. I also like that they did not skimp on it relative to the size of the roll.

However, while I realized good lobsters are expensive, I do have to mention I was taken aback by how small this thing actually was, I'm talking appetizer size. It was this that caused me to dock a star.

The best food experience we had on our trip from Orlando, Portland, DC and Seattle and one of the most memorable restaurants I've ate at. Their take on the Lobster Roll was the best in Portland. We came and tried rolls all over at the other highly rated restaurants, but Eventide was so good, we came back again (in our 2.5 days in Portland!). Even when you roll in at 10PM those lobster rolls are perfection. The only qualm a have is how tiny it is! Look at the pic - it's half the length of a butter knife! I finished in 3 bites and cried because it was over much too soon. 

What sets this restaurant apart is the delicate Asian influences subtly incorporated throughout the dishes. The lobster roll uses a Chinese steamed bun - I actually like this more than the traditional roll because the lobster flavor comes through more. The nori in the clam chowder is typical of a ramen bowl. 

Even my friend who was used to the traditional cold mayo lobster roll preferred this one.

Fair warning, there is a line. I arrived at 12:30 on a Tuesday and it was still super busy. We waited around 20 minutes in line outside in order to put our name down for a table (and the wait on top of that was 20/30 minutes). Be patient though as the food is worth it!! 

The restaurant was a bright vibrant interior but as it is a bit small, I would not recommend it for very large parties. 

Oysters: The waiter was kind and helped us in ordering raw oysters. There was a sheet of paper that showed us which ones we were eating. Personally I am not a fan of raw oysters but this place changed my mind! They were beautifully served on a tray of ice and had this great flavor without being too fishy. 

Lobster Rolls: This is served in the white asian steamed buns instead of your typical bread. The bread is a lot softer and doesn't have a crunch. Lobster is also made with brown butter. It was delicious! Different texture but it all melted in your mouth! 

Oyster Roll: The oysters were lightly fried with some jalapeños on top, also sandwiched in between the asian steamed buns. Also delicious. 

Grilled Swordfish: Came with two spicy/curry sauces that were great! The fish was so beautifully smooth and came apart easily with your fork! 

Clam Chowder: Not what you expect. It is not that typical creamy/white/thick texture. It has a thin base with mini-cut potatoes and lovely bits of clam. The clam itself was great but I think I prefer your standard creamy clam chowder.

My boyfriend very much liked the kimchi ice and found it a unique and delicious accompaniment to the oysters. The lobster roll was very small, and I did not find the bao-style bun to go as well with the lobster as a typical maine lobster roll bun does. The lobster stew was the highlight of the meal in my opinion - it's made with coconut milk and has a great Thai taste. Finally, the New England clam bake was a bit of a disappointment. It has maybe a dozen steamers and a dozen mussels, one small lobster tail, two small fingerling potato, two small pieces of bacon and a boiled egg.

I first ordered the lobster roll and this was definitely the best in New England. Very buttery and full of flavor. 
I then went on to the oysters and being a novice the waitress offered to pick them out for me which was very nice. I can say that every type I tried was fantastic. 
With that being said I went on to the desert and heard about their ice cream sandwich made between two homemade cookies and WOW! I can't emphasize how good that cookie was on a ice cold night as well. 
The service made the experience everyone was so friendly and if you sit at the bar you can watch your oysters be prepared which was very cool.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

My wife and I visited on a Saturday around lunchtime. We arrived 10 minutes before opening, but were greeted by a long line. The line moved quickly and soon we had to bar seats at the window. 

Our server was friendly, fast and had great recommendations. He recommended the tuna cruo and the fried oyster rolls. We got both, along with several other items. 

We started with the Chowder. This isn't the traditional clam chowder - as opposed to being creamy, this was thinner and lighter. The broth itself was delightful - flavorful and satisfying, without the heaviness. The potatos and clams were equally tasty. We ordered two bowls, but we probably could have gotten away with one to split. 

Next up was the Tuna Crudo. This was a recommendation from our server and was truly a delight. The tuna was melt in your mouth tender and the light dressing was the perfect compliment. I wish we would have ordered two. 

The brown butter lobster roll was next. The size is small (if you're sharing - you're only getting a bit or two), but it was tasty. The bun was not your traditional bread, but rather it was more like a steamed bun. I will say this was my least favorite thing we had, but it was still very good. (For me, its hard to beat a regular old lobster roll). 

The fried oyster roll was next and was another crowd pleaser. Again, served on a steam bun-like roll, the fried oyster roll is packed full of flavor. And like the lobster roll, this is a smaller item (I've included my hand in the picture to give size reference). 

We also ordered the heirloom tomato salad. I love heirloom tomatoes and will order them on almost any menu. This was served with an eggplant mash and pepitas. This was such a nice combination of sweet, savory and crunchy. 

Eventide also has a great oyster bar (we skipped it, as the wedding we were attending later was serving oysters) and an even better regular bar (alcohol bar?). 

Overall this is a great place to share a drink and some great twists on classic seafood.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

The lobster roll was warm and buttery, but definitely small. Maybe half the size of a regular bun. Three bites and it was gone. The crab claws were meaty. Definitely worth it. 

They do have a good size oyster bar. I didn't try their oysters, but it did notice they were popular. We arrived right before the crowd and were lucky to be seated right away. We sat at the bar.

It was life changing. No other lobster roll I'll have in the future will ever live up. I'm sure, they'll be delicious but they won't be THIS delicious. Eventide's rolls are smaller, as are most dishes here (think shared plates/tapas sized) so if you're super hungry and JUST want a lobster roll I'd recommend two. I wish I had order another one. 

But instead we also split a few other plates, including the delicious clam chowder. There's is a bit different than traditional clam chowders (a little less thick) but SO delicious. The oysters are also amazing, of course, and they have a fantastic variety of east coast options. So fresh! I had previously thought I wasn't a big fan of east coast oysters (preferring west) but I guess I've just had the wrong kinds because these were fantastic. The tuna tartare was also quite good. The halibut was also tasty and a whoopie pie for dessert is a must. 

The restaurant itself is always busy but they have a fantastic automated system so you can track your progress on the wait list and you'll get a text when your table is close to be being ready.

The lobster roll was also refreshing, luscious, and tasty - though we would have a preferred a buttery toast to hug our lobster. The clam chowder had depth, layers of flavor and was surprisingly light.

It gets busy, so be prepared to wait. But feel free to order a drink and snack while you wait, the staff is super helpful and makes your wait as comfortable as possible. We had a couple of well crafted bloody mary's while we waited for our table. 

Once seated the service continued to be top notch. All we knew as that we wanted the lobster role, so we asked for guidance from our server. She was probably the best server I've had in the past 5 years. She advised us through the menu, we expressed our dietary preferences and she suggested the best things on the menu. 

We ordered everything she suggested and were SO HAPPY we did. The lobster role is the best I've ever had! All of the fish was so fresh and delicious. We ordered every special on the menu and even something that our server suggested that was not on the menu. The fresh fish arrived in the morning and the thought of the dish a couple hours prior to serving it to us! The seafood was treated with care, delicate and flavorful with a hint of whimsy.

If you're here during peak eating times, you'll likely have to wait. If you're like me and want to be there before opening (11AM), I recommend arriving at least 45 minutes before to be first in line. Do not come shorter than 30 minutes before opening to be sure you have a solid spot for you and your party. The line starts to stack hard 15 minutes before opening. This, of course, applies to the weekend, not sure about the weekdays.

You obviously need to get on that Eventide Brown Butter Lobster Roll. I would also try the New England Clam Bake if you want a good sampler of the goodness they can serve you (steamers, mussels, lobster tail, potatoes, salt pork and a hard boiled egg nestled into a bed of rock seaweed, served with drawn butter). My wife and I were moderately hungry and these 2 items hit the spot. If we wanted more, we would've also ordered a half dozen oysters and clam chowder but we were happy with just these 2 items.

Be prepared for a bit of a wait when visiting Eventide. We arrived on a Saturday around 1:30PM there was a two hour wait-but no wait if we wanted to stand at the bar area. We were totally fine with that. The standing area doesn't have much counter space, but you get a lovely view of Oysters on ice. Despite not being at a table, our server was super attentive and on point. She helped us pick Oysters which were all outstanding. I loved my Oyster jalapeño/vodka shooter as well. It was a nice start to my seafood adventure. We ordered several dishes and added more because everything was so amazing. The first out was the mussels dish. The combination of crispy potatoe and juicy mussels, with spicy and creamy mayo flavor was out of this world. 
The lobster roll with brown butter was one of the best things i've ever eaten. The lobster is piled on top of a fluffy chinese bun. This combo is incredible. The lobster itself is seasoned and buttered to perfection. I could have eaten eighteen thousand of them. 
Next up we had the smoked Icelandic Char. With the combo of everything spice, smoked salmon and onion it really felt like diving into a bagel. The tuna crudo with ginger-scallion, tare and radish was the best i've ever had. If you are a martini fan, the dirty dirty martini with oyster brine and hot sauce was impeccable, and went very well with my seafood.

1.) The oysters: They were delicious (we did a dozen and let the waitress select different types from all over Maine). The horseradish ice is a nice touch.

2.) The tuna crudo: (If you're not into raw fish then maybe not for you but we ordered this on a whim and it ended up being one of my favorite things).

3.) The CEVICHE: The best thing we ordered hands-down. I haven't found ceviche this good since I lived in Ecuador.

4.) Lobster roll: It was great but very different than any lobster roll you've ever had. On a asian-like bun and the sauce it is in is very unique.

5.) The fish sandwich: Really yummy and unlike any fish sandwich I've ever eaten. There was a nice aioli on it that really gave it a nice flavor.

6.) The nori chips: These are homemade potato chips sprinkled with seaweed. These sounded awesome but they were actually kind of ""meh."" Wouldn't get them again.

The big chunks of carrots are perfect too, a little but of sweetness.  yes there's alot of butter and i typically can't handle a ton of butter but it was soooo tasty and not too rich and didn't linger on my tongue.

I order a gin/cucumber cocktail that wasn't the best itself, but very refreshing with different plates we ordered. 

We started out with a dozen oysters and the lobster stew. I don't know much about oysters, but they tasted great. My coworker, who loves his oysters, was raving about them. The stew was great too, not creamy and heavy but packed with lobster and very flavorful. 

We then ordered the main dishes of brown butter lobster rolls, tuna tartare & black cod (a special for the evening). The lobster rolls were truly the best I've ever had - sweet, warm, packed with lobster, just too small! The tuna was great, but very small as well. Probably wouldn't get that again just as I don't think it's worth $15. The black cod was unbelievable. Small too but unique and done very well. 

For dessert (all made in house) my coworker got the pie of the day (some cranberry concoction) and I the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. Fabulous! But put me over the edge as far as fullness. 

For 3 cocktails, dozen oysters, 2 lobster rolls, 2 stews, tuna tartare, black cod, and 2 desserts, the total was $170. We definitely overindulged, but it was worth it!

The plates are pretty small, so we ordered two entrees each. In total, we ordered two lobster rolls, one crab roll, and one scallop waffle special. The dishes come out as they are ready, which was really really fast. It took about 5 minutes for all the rolls to come out, and about 10 minutes for the waffle.

The rolls were on a steamed bun rather than the traditional hamburger bun. GREAT move. The bun was so so fluffy and warm, and the filling was so flavorful and delicious. The amount of butter in the lobster roll and the mayo in the crab roll were perfect. And the meat tasted very very fresh.

The waffle was very delicious as well. It was small but very flavorful. The yaki sauce and seaweed on the waffle was very good. 

My only complaint is that the bathroom is very small/wait is long. I really need to use the bathroom but there was a line the entire time I was at the restaurant.

The good thing about the wait is we could go online to see the number of parties ahead of us and walk around the area or check out some bars while we waited. 

We let our server choose his favorite oysters for us and they were all delicious, sweet and not too briny, which was what we requested. I really enjoyed the ice selection to top the oysters, giving the flavors an extra oomph! The ices were frozen juices from brines and shaved like a slushie. The best combos were red wine minionette, red onion ice and horseradish ice. Black pepper ice was good but too overpowering on the delicate oysters, and kimchi ice was too pungent. 

My friends got the ouster shooters, which came with a 4 or 6-oz cocktail, but my friends said it wasn't really worth $7, and they'd rather just eat more oysters without the shot. We also orders raw clams, which were juicy and sweet.

The lobster roll is different because they use the Chinese bun rather than the normal bun. It didn't make it taste better or worse. It's just a lobster roll. The tuna tartar's flavor is not that good, so I had to keep getting more sriracha to cover it up.

We came for their Lobster Roll.  It's $15.00 and on the small side, but I promise you it is totally worth every penny.  It comes out on a warm soft bun and the lobster bits are huge.  My friend even ordered two!  If they delivered, I'd honestly consider seeing if they'd come to Alabama!   Their raw oysters were mouth watering!  We ordered a dozen of their top recommended oysters.  When ordering you have the option to add tabasco ice, Worcestershire ice and whatever other condiments you'd want on the side.  The drinks were so-so.  I ordered a spritzer of some sort, but I was not a big fan.  For $10, you best believe I finished every last drop!  The bloody mary was pretty good, though!

When planning your trip to Eventide, be prepared to wait awhile if you go at normal eating times.  The restaurant is pretty small, so the wait time adds up fast.

I had the yellowfin tuna crudo to start and it blew me away. It might actually have been one of the best things I've ever eaten so far in my 27 years of food. The quality of the fish combined with the exceptional flavors on top really blew me away and just melted in my mouth.  I would come back for this alone.

Then I had the lobster roll. The famed lobster roll. Yes it's tiny, yes it's $15, and yes it's worth it. The sweet soft roll is the perfect holder for the mound of lobster on top. And the lobster is seasoned just enough to create flavor and not too much that you forget it's lobster.  

Pro tip: they don't advertise fries on their menu, only potato chips, but if you ask, you can get them. Apparently they're usually for kids, but hey, I'm not that old!

Seafood chowder with coconut milk had good flavor, but it was really salty for our taste, but we finished it due to the cold weather outside.

Lobster roll was definitely delicious - brown butter lobster stuffed in a warm, chinese bun. Great flavor and texture all around, but ridiculously small portion.

They were excellent with the pepper ice being a great garnish for the oysters.

We then had the steamed seafood combo which consisted of a half of a lobster, a dozen and a half mussels and the same quantity of steamers.  Our waiter was really great at helping us order and giving us tips on how best to eat the food we ordered.  

I was a great meal and the only suggestion I would have to improve the experience is for the restaurant to consider serving a complimentary cracker or artisan bread when ordering with maybe a small seafood dip or olive oil. This would be a great starter while ordering and ensure customers do not go away feeling hungry as a number of reviewers have commented on and be done at little cost.

There's a decent variety of beers on tap and their mixed drinks are tasty, with a few tiki drinks thrown in. Even with people who don't drink alcohol, the bartenders make really good mocktails.
The only two things they can do better: 1. More accurate on the wait times as I've waited longer for tables than the original estimate (go over rather than under, please). 2.

Like everyone else has said, it has been one of the best seafood restaurants that I've had.  Even something as simple as clam chowder was pretty perfect.  I will say that the price is incredibly high for the amount of food you get.  Even after our lunch of clam chowder, clam bake and a lobster roll, we left kind of hungry.  The lobster roll is about the size of a twinkie so splitting it was someone give you two bites or so.  With that being said, this is definitely a splurge kind of restaurant.  

The only reason this gets 4 stars versus 5 is the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It felt really pretentious and not warm and friendly.  We actually came in the night before to see if we could get a table for dinner.  When I walked up to the podium I saw the hostess clearly see me out of her peripheral but chose to ignore me.

I apologized profusely because I didn't the line was just to check the wait times.  I understand that this is probably an everyday occurrence for her but for her but there was no need for her to be rude.

We also had the pie of the day - a blueberry peach oatmeal concoction. My husband and I believe that's the best fruit pie we have ever had! It was almost a bit to filling heavy, but the filling was not too sweet/ not too tart. And the crush was warm, flakey, and didn't fall apart!

First off, the wait times are ridiculous. We came several times and were quoted hour-long waits no matter what time of day it was. We also noticed big empty spots at the communal tables, but when we asked the hostess she said they wanted to give people plenty of space to eat and feel comfortable.

The good: I got a dozen Maine oysters, four each from Blackstone Point, Wolfe's Neck, and Moshier Island, three varieties that my waitress recommended to me. My condiments of choice were the classic cocktail sauce and a more unorthodox kimchi ice (essentially that flavor in a shaved ice format). The oysters were plump and quite tasty, with a good amount of brininess and a bit of that sweet warm flavor sneaking in. These were especially nice with the cocktail sauce and a bit of that tart, pickled, refreshing flavor from the kimchi ice.

The decent: The brown butter lobster roll was pretty tasty but miniscule. I normally like that fluffy Asian bun, but here it felt too thick compared to the lobster. Speaking of which, I prefer fresher tasting and juicy lobster versus this version. My friend liked his fried oyster bun, but again, it was itty bitty.

The bad: The lobster stew was straight up salt. Ugh. I couldn't even have more than a few spoonfuls of this because I was in dire need of water. What a shame because the ingredients were nicely cooked, like the lobster and mushrooms. Hard pass on this. We also got the New England clam bake because it sounded and looked glorious. The giant dish consisted of lobster tail, steamers, mussels, salt pork, and potatoes on a bed of seaweed with drawn butter. The dish claimed to come with nori vinaigrette, but we either didn't get any or we couldn't taste it if it had been drizzled over the food. Sadly, all the seafood was dry. The mussels were especially disappointing, and considering we had really juicy, delicious steamers at J's Oyster the night before, the ones here were a major letdown. The pork was yummy, but that was about it. Not sure if this was a fluke or just an undeservedly hyped dish.

Bottom line: If you must come, do it for the oysters, but I'd steer clear of the other stuff. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere with half to no wait time. Overrated with a capital O-V-E-R... well, you get it.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

Nestled away, from the busy pier and the pricey front river restaurants sits this little unique place.  Tiny, homey, and extremely warm inside, it provides a unique setting and with excellent service of a generation that feels like it is redefining the food scene in this city.  There wasn't a single employee at this place who didn't have a genuine smile on their face when I visited it seemed.

It is abundantly clear from the start that the menu here is tailored by someone special.  Little nuances actually work, such as red onion shaved ice in your oyster plate.  A lobster stew, New England simple?  Hardly, nestled with green curry and flavors of Thai coconut it bursts with complimentary flavors.  The chowder is a little more familiar, and loaded with chunky greatness.  Squash is nestled with fish sauce, and tempura crusted fried to perfection, making the perfect vegetable like tater tot.  Blackened cod is spectacular to it's perfectly crunch skin, to it's nearly low cooked flavored almost sashimi like just over rare texture.  Fusion food this isn't, it's just smart cuisine.

The place is more a designed tapas style place, than a sequenced meal even though that's not really how it's presented.  Small plates trend once again, you will find yourself probably having to try a few to get a full meal, which can add up as well.

Overall though what is coming out of the kitchen is unique prepared with a twist that actually works and makes sense.  Someone here has the right palate going and it makes for a great experience.  Not just unique food in Portland, this is really a well done place in the U.S. period.",4.5,2,"['86 Middle St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65943,-70.25123,"Seafood, "

It was lukewarm when we got to it but it was still so delicious! Love that the lobster roll doesn't come on the traditional buttered toast. The flavor of the lobster really comes out because it's not overshadowed by the extra butter.

The Korean fried chicken bun was pretty good. I've had better at a food truck in Lynchburg, VA so obviously chicken isn't the thing the get here in Maine lol.

Ok, now let's talk about the best thing we got: THE FISH SANDWICH. Omg! I'm not a fried fish person AT ALL, like I despise any type of fish besides salmon and I NEVER eat any fried foods. But this FISH! The crust was perfectly crisp, so tender & the flavor was amazing. The sweet pickles added to the flavor and then the lettuce & tartar sauce (which I also NEVER eat) just sealed the deal. Simple, just the way I like it, but your tastebuds will def have a party. My 2 year old, who is very picky, ate just about all of it. I would say this would be something you MUST get.

I really wanted to get the lobster melt since it's unique, but I couldn't resist sticking to the lobster roll.  For $19, you get a lobster roll full of fresh lobster and your choice of sauce.  I went with the jalapeno mayo.  Although had I realized they had lobster ghee, I probably would have gone with that (how can you go wrong with lobster-infused clarified butter?).

The lobster roll was excellent.  The roll was nicely buttered and toasted on the outside.  There was a lot of lobster claw meat inside.  The meat was so sweet and tender.  There was just enough lettuce to sort of have some lettuce in each bite, but not enough lettuce to take away from the lobster flavor.

I also got the small side of fries and they were great.  They were seasoned with Old Bay and super crispy.

They make unsweetened ice tea in-house, which was the perfect accompaniment to the lobster roll.

A similar lobster roll to this in Boston would cost $35.  $19 is a steal for the quality that The High Roller is serving.

I have been here soooo many times, trying to love HighRoller. The staff and owners are great. The concept is great. The social media pages are beyond great. But I'm very confident in stating that this is perhaps the most average restaurant that I've ever been to.

Maybe last night was the final straw. Popcorn lobster for $17 consisted of five, possibly 1"" pieces of fried lobster over shoestring fries. It was barely an appetizer. And the crab dip with chips is just terrible. I've had this multiple times due to friends ordering it, and it's not a good dish. The lobster roll is fine. It's an average plus Portland lobster roll, but it isn't cheap. When Luke's Lobster opens hopefully the competition spurs improvement. The lobster grilled cheese is much better. The lobster in the cheesy shell is too salty for my taste. The best lobster restaurants get their lobster fresh off the boat in the morning and are sold out by night. HighRoller tastes like it's been sitting in a fridge for a couple days. 

The draft beer selection should be amazing but again, it's average. There are always a surprising number of beers not from Maine, when (I think) nearly all should be local. The bottle/can selection is better but most wouldn't even know it exists. The ordering process when the restaurant is busy also doesn't work well.

So I've stated the negative, but there is a lot to like. The food (besides the crab dip) is fine, especially considering there are not great alternatives for casual lobster downtown year round (though again, Luke's will change this). The staff are extremely nice, and the vibe is cool. But after a dozen visits, I'm done hoping that HighRoller will change. It is what it is.

Small but interesting local tap list. LOTS of sours and Belgians in bottles of you like that sort of thing. 

We each ordered a lobster roll with the red pepper sauce. They were PERFECT! Flavorful lobster on a fresh toasted roll. Split a cup of fries - they are the shoestring kind with Old Bay. Not bad, but I prefer the thicker ones. 

Bartender was super friendly and let me taste a few beers even after we were done eating.

What I LOVE about Highroller is that they make it so easy to customize your lobster roll and add yummy flavors that compliment the taste of the lobster. I guess that probably the main reason lobster rolls are typically so simple is to not distract from the lobster? Well, I personally think that's dumb. And they're boring that way. 

Highroller gives you tons of toppings and sauce options, which makes the taste of lobster (which is super fresh and delicious, by the way) pop and adds some tasty bulk to the roll as a whole. We opted for some fresh avocado and a combo of jalapeño and lime mayos. Absolute heaven.

I say ""Maine"" lobster roll because I'm from Connecticut and Connecticut lobster rolls are typically hot. Maine lobster rolls are typically cold. That's in general of course because exceptions exist in either state.

I liked my lobster roll. It didn't have a lot of mayonnaise. It contained a very very light coating of mayonnaise. Different sauces are available to accompany the lobster roll. I selected the lime mayo sauce and it was very good.

The bun was a little oversized but the lettuce wedge was a nice touch. We don't get lettuce wedges on our lobsters rolls in Connecticut.

French fries were very good as well.

The interior decor is somewhat similar to Five Guys, with lots of small red checker patterns scattered all over the place.

HighRoller serves Instagram worth lobster rolls. My boyfriend and I both got the lobster roll ($19), which comes with a brioche bun, romaine lettuce, lobster, and a choice of sauce. I got the honey dijonaisse, and he got the charred pineapple mayo. 

The pineapple mayo was much better than the honey dijonaisse, but overall, I wasn't super impressed with my lobster roll, especially since you can get one on nearly every menu in this area. I thought the lobster had a very mild flavor, and we only got a few pieces of lobster. Perhaps since it was later in the day, we didn't get as much or as good of lobster. 

Perhaps my experience was unique, but there are better lobster rolls to be had in Portland. Skip the wait!",4.5,2,"['104 Exchange St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.658296,-70.256064,"Seafood, Food Stands, "

I take that back: it would have been the perfect meal if I had come in ravenously hungry, not having eaten all day, but I made the unfortunate (or wonderful) decision to have a Belleville croissant that day for breakfast so I wasn't in top eating form. 

The roll is enormous, with double the amount of lobster I see at most lobster roll places. You can choose your sauce to go on top or on the side, and I went with the lobster ghee, which made the whole thing even more decadent. 

I also got a cup of fries on the side, with which you can select two additional sauces (I went with the curry ketchup and lime mayo) on the side. I'm not sure if it was Old Bay or some other kind of seasoning on the fries, but I liked that it was subtle and gave it a little kick beyond your basic fries. 

Next time I think I might try the lobster taco, whose shell is made of crispy cheese instead of a tortilla (!) 

As for the experience overall, the interior is spacious and clean if a bit sterile, and though I initially got some confusing instructions on ordering and seating from the uninterested hostess, the guys behind the bar and serving the food were really nice and engaged.

There is no outdoor dining, but the FRESH, tender, delicious lobster! There are a couple gluten free options and if you don't eat lobster, other options can be found (burger, salad).
I had the grilled cheese taco lobster roll ... delish!! (I've always loved baked on cheese anyway!) My companion had the regular lobster roll and we had coleslaw and each tried two different dressings/dips.
We liked the lobster ghee, charred pineapple, lime mayo...ever so lightly. The honey dijon completely masked the flavor of the lobster, neither of us cared for it. 
The coleslaw was very tasty and not too sharp or sweet. Will definitely return again soon!

The lobster roll came out so fast I felt like maybe they had been reading my thoughts. Which is fine. Sorry about the weird shit, but you were in there, you know.

I gotta say, I dig the mayo. I think it might be a better choice than butter. I don't know. 

But I stand fast that hot lobster is better than cold lobster. Heat that shit up, Maine. Try it. Just heat it up with the mayo. Let's compromise. See what happens. I think you're gonna like it.

494,GwMI5lBjDk_NlDF-PqFt8w,the-highroller-lobster,494,2018-07-09,"After receiving numerous recommendations about HighRoller, the pushing factor that got me through these doors was my husband learning that they served Froze (his new favorite drink). 

HighRoller is nestled in towards the top of Exchange street. Given all the current/recent construction in the area, it is an easy place to go unnoticed. However, if you find your way here you won't be disappointed. 

The interior is just what you would expect of a cute little Maine lobster shop. It is consumed with red's and whites and has a very simple relaxed vibe. Right as you walk in the door, you are immediately greeted by a register where you place you order once ready. 

The menu has a decent variety of lobster options to choose from (tacos, traditional rolls, grilled cheese). I chose to order the lobster grilled cheese, an order of fries, and a Bloody Mary. 

The service was pretty quick and our food was delivered within 10-15 minutes. Everything was amazing! I found that the grilled cheese was filled with a good amount of lobster and that they used quality cheese which provided a nice richness that perfectly complemented the lobster. The fries had a wonderful Cajun seasoning and came extra crispy which is a personal favorite. Their dipping sauces were also very tasty with a favorite being the Jalapeño mayo. 

As you can expect, the prices were that of which you would expect for any lobster place and the meals with lobster were around $19 each. Definitely not a place I would dine at every week, but I will certainly be coming back whenever I need a good lobster fix.",4.5,2,"['104 Exchange St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.658296,-70.256064,"Seafood, Food Stands, "

This roll definitely hits the spot- it won't totally blow your mind or shock you with its uniqueness, but it's precisely what a cold lobster roll should be IMO (especially accompanied with a pint of local beer) and I left very satisfied.

I also dug their potato salad- lots of flavor, and a good accompaniment to my roll. The fries are solid too, although I'd rather save that for elsewhere (like Duckfat). And the corndog was good as well, if you're not a lobster person.

I do dig the diner vibe and counter service, although wish they could find a way to separate the lines between the people trying to put their name in for a table and the people trying to order (you get seated first and then need to go back up to the counter to order), which can get crowded and confusing/not efficient.

Getting a reservation is borderline impossible so your best bet is to go as a duo and try for a walk in. They reserve a third of their tables for walk ins although the wait is really long. We waited about 2 hours for our table but it was worth it in the end as this was one of the meals I have had a while.

When you walk in, you're immediately drunk off the intoxicating aroma of the burning wood stoves they use to cook most of their meats. So many items are wood grilled and the end result is you feel like you're sitting by a cozy campfire eating perfect food. Beyond that the candle light votives really enhance the ambiance of the restaurant. 

Once we sat down they brought us the house bread which is made by the bakery downstairs. The sourdough misch is incredible and it is the perfect tool to sop up all the juices from your meal. From there we had the warm foie gras lobe which was the duck liver lobe cooked to perfection. It practically exploded on your knife when you cut into it melting as you spread it on your bread. Everything about it was perfect. 

Our main course was the pork chop and the roasted chicken.  The pork chop was juicy, smokey, and supremely flavorful. This is a must get. With a side of the mashed potatoes,  the combination was a bit of heaven on earth.The grilled chicken was well prepared but lacking a bit on flavor, it could've used a smattering of garlic and fresh herbs to liven it up.

We finished the meal with the apple crisp and the walnut pie. The crisp was overly spiced with what resembles a deep cider flavor. The pie was excellent and it mimicked a pecan pie.

Food and service are top notch, so I'm glad this place was so-highly recommended. 

After my drink order was taken, I was started off with a plentiful basket of Standard Baking Co. (amazing bakery in Portland, which I believe own-affiliated with Fore Street, along with Scales and Street & Co.) sourdough bread, with ample creamy butter, salt, and pepper. 

I honestly don't quite recall what cocktails (2) I had, but they were delightful. 

For my first dish, I ordered the famed Wood Oven Roasted Maine Mussels in garlic almond butter and dry vermouth. Wow. Best mussels I've ever had...and with that delicious sourdough, there was no broth left when I was done with that (quasi-questionable decision, because this kept me to two dishes instead of a planned through...but it was soooo good!)

Second dish was the Wood Grilled Atlantic Squid with grilled napa, scallion, pea tendril, fermented red pepper aioli and carrots. OMG again. I don't know what it was, but this squid/calamari was just packed with so much flavor, it was unbelievable.

I've only heard of this town as a foodie Mecca by friends and relatives and now that my kid is at sleep away for two blissful weeks... it was time for us to food crawl through this quaint sea side town.... first stop Fore Street.

This old brick building sports what seems to be the original metal casement windows and once you enter, you can feel the warmth of a cozy, darkened dining room, ample bar and a bustling open kitchen.  We sat for a cocktail on the deep sofas in the bar area whilst they readied our table and the impression here is that whether you meet your many friends here, or you are gunning for a canoodling romantic dinner, you will be pleased!  I had a neat pour of Booker's with a side of ice and wifey chose from their cocktail offerings-- a Martini made with vodka, grapefruit, elder flower and a rosemary sprig.  Perhaps 14-16 bucks for this cocktail is not the greatest of values, but she enjoyed it nevertheless.

Benson was our waiter this evening and he navigated is through tonight's offerings which change daily and thoroughly as we learned.  The Menu is divided into courses of small plates that run the gamut from salads and soups to sea and land plates and then to an ample array of charcuterie.  We began with the heirloom carrot and pea salad and a charcuterie of pork terrine, chicken liver mousse, pickled lamb heart and tongue and the usual array of accompaniments.  When paired with their artisan bread this really could have been a meal on its own given the richness level.  Everything was stellar-- the greens were fresh and flavorful and the charcuterie scintillated with wonderfully gamey flavors and spices that matched up well with the jam and mustard as well as with the Tuscan red that Benson picked out for us.

Our mains were no less amazing-- wifey had the blue fish, fire roasted atop a tomato basil and duck fat potato mash and I had the ""medium"" hangar steak served with cippolini onions and mushrooms.  Benson convinced me that ""medium"" was the right call on this cut and thankfully, their version of medium was nice and pink.....We also enjoyed our sides of roasted cauliflower and squash.

For dessert we enjoyed a cheese course where we picked three of the 9 or so offerings and just like the charcuterie, they come arranges with the appropriate accompaniments such as almonds and and a house made jam to counter the gaminess.  The Triple creme Brie was the standout on this plate as it was a piquant blast of creamy heaven..... not something I usually get out of this type.

On the whole Fore Street was an amazing start to our foodie crawl as every course was expertly prepared and presented with fresh and semi local ingredients.  Great job guys and we look forward to our next ""Fore-ay"" here.... (sorry.... couldn't resist....)

We started off with three appetizers: mussels with almond butter, a chilled seafood platter, and a dozen oysters. The mussels were pretty good. I thought the broth could have used a stronger almond flavor though. The seafood platter was a great sampler of a bunch of different fishes. The oysters are spectacular. They're masterfully chucked, and the opposite of slimy. 

For my main course, I opted for the oven roasted lobster, which came with a side of a corn pudding. This was a killer lobster. Truly one of the best cooks on a lobster I've had....which makes sense since this is a top restaurant in Maine. It's soft and buttery, and the corn side was actually the best part of my meal. Super unique concept and a really fun texture. My dad ordered the lamb dish, and his lamb was VERY tough, so just be wary of that if you're considering that dish.

For dessert, I got the chocolate creme brulee. It was small but tasty. Not a bad way to cap off the meal.

Fore Street should probably get 5-stars if it was based on the food alone, but I see an issue with giving them that distinction after a really weird interaction I had at the restaurant. I, a 21-year-old, decided to order a cocktail which was advertised as blueberry and mezcal. I ordered the drink, and the waiter didn't ask to see my ID, but I assumed there wouldn't be any problems. I got my blueberry drink, and it was honestly pretty bad BUT it really didn't taste like alcohol at all. And I'm a lightweight and didn't even feel slightly tipsy. When the bill came we noticed that the drink was less expensive than advertised on the menu, and the waiter informed us that it was actually a MOCKTAIL, because he thought I was underage. Well, I could've shown you my ID if you were curious because I don't typically like drinking straight sodas.

Their menu changes every day -- I can't remember the exact names of everything we ordered, but I'll try my best. For appetizers, we got the SOFT SHELL CRAB which was pretty bomb. We also got this platter of chilled seafood -- it was unique but it wasn't that great. It was just five different samples of fish I believe. I got the SEA SCALLOPS and they were plated on top of different greens and I think some type of grain. Out of all the things I tried that night, the scallops were the best, in my opinion. One of the girls got a skirt steak I believe which was also delicious and quite juicy and tender. 

The price is pretty hefty and don't think it's worth it for some of the appetizers we had. I love it when restaurants change the menus every day. I'll definitely be back the next I'm in town.

532,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,532,2018-09-03,"OMG.  Three letters are all that is necessary to describe an experience at Fore Street.  It's not every day that you come across an experience that transcends or alters your opinion of what something should be or has been for all your life.  Today, at Fore Street, that moment in time where you are given a choice, take the blue pill, which will ultimately lead to a blissful and safe but ignorant experience or take that red pill, the one that will free your mind, change your perception of reality, change untruths you've held dear from day one.

Morpheus (masquerading as my server this evening as David B.) steered me, Neo, towards that red pill and changed my perception of how good a pork chop can be forever.  Never before have I had a pork chop that wasn't over salted, fried, simmering in butter, or wrapped around some other fatty pork(pork belly) to add flavor or juiciness.  This pork chop needed none of that to be better than any other pork chop I've had.  This pork chop was tender and juicy, full of flavor, but not salty.  It was wrapped around this slightly sweet almost ketchup-y tomato gastrique, surrounded by absolutely perfect black trumpets, sweet peppers, corn and alliums which were plate cleaning licking awesome.  David's mild insistence that while that Hanger steak was going to be a great option as well, that this Pork Chop, cooked by that guy (he pointed to him) behind working the grill, was going to be the best Pork Chop ever.  Now I know how Neo felt when Morpheus gave Neo the freedom to choose and nothing will ever be the same.

If you ever get David,.... uhhh, Morpheus as your server, just listen to his suggestions.  Aside from this Pork Chop, he was spot on in regards to the Wood Grilled Longfin Squid and Wood Oven Roasted Mussels.  Before that Pork Chop entered my life, the Squid was going to be what I would have gushed about.  As it stands, this super tender squid will have to take a back seat.  Of the remaining items I tried this evening, the Foie Gras and Wild Mushroom & Grilled Corn Salad were amazing as well.

For dessert, the Nectarine Tarte and done.  Really.  Sweet and fresh sliced nectarines layered on top of a buttery crust and ultimately topped with ice cream.  All the desserts are insanely sized for like two or three.  

The entire experience was eye opening from the moment I sat down.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen area, right next to the wood burning oven, was the best seat in the house.  I was so close I felt like I was cooking tonight with all the heat that was generated by that oven.  Of all the dinners I've had in Portland, and there have been many, this has to be the dinner that tops all others.

Sadly with this knowledge that Pork Chop doesn't have to be dry and brined for hours, there is sadly one big issue, and that is I won't be able to replicate this Pork Chop myself or get to Fore Street often enough to enjoy.

I ordered the flank steak as my entree, cooked perfectly and it was delicious. My friend ordered the duck cooked two ways which comes with breast and a duck leg. I ate some of the duck breast and it was delicious! The entrees don't really come with sides, you have to order them separately. We ordered garlic mashed potatoes and fingerling potatoes. Both were delicious and I would order them again ($8 each and they are shareable portions). The entrees cost about $35 and up.

We wanted everything, but settled on the mussels (heavenly sauce, no grit, and yes, I confess we saw it on television), lamb sausage with cornmeal cake which arrived looking something like a street taco but not tasting like anything you could grab on the corner, roasted chicken that was tender and crispy, although maybe a little too salty, the hanger steak which had that lovely flavor you only get from cooking over an open fire and that melting tenderness which meant that cow must have exercised less than me, and a shared side of creamy butter with a little bit of potato mashed in to keep it on your fork.

Patrick, our waiter, was busy but gave us good service, and other than the salty chicken the only complaint I had was a little indigestion after, for which I blame our menu choices.

538,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,538,2018-08-18,"After a few visits into town - and forgetting to make a reservation in advance - we decided that we'd hit up Fore Street via the walk-in line and grab a meal before heading back to the airport. We arrived around 4:20 PM, and we were the only folks there for about 10-15 minutes on Sunday...for future reference, coming for a walk-in spot at 4:45 PM would be more than okay IMO. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the kitchen does not actually open until 5:30 PM - so if you are under the gun for time (like we were), you'll probably do what we did and end up eating dinner at the bar. It's plenty nice enough - a view of a classy, well-stocked bar full of liquor never gets old - but it doesn't quite compare to how the dining room looks, with its high ceilings and wooden slats marrying the industrial feel of the brick building the restaurant is housed in with a more rustic sensibility. That said, we were serviced pretty quickly at the bar and had plenty of time to spare when it came to making our flight - so no complaints there. The drink selection is what you'd expect - a handful of local ales - and the cocktail I had was pretty good as well.

The food here is excellent overall, and it's easy to see why after all these years, it is still the standard-bearer for the Portland food scene. For starters, though - the sourdough served here (unsurprisingly from Standard Baking, which is in the lower half of this building) is excellent. We started out with a few appetizers, with the oysters being the first served - a nice selection of local oysters that showcased some of the subtle differences in salinity and finishes. The mussels were excellent, and I really enjoyed the garlic almond butter giving the broth something a bit creamier and nuttier relative to a standard white wine sauce. Our last appetizer was the seasonal salad, which was light but not necessarily distinguishable in any way...definitely the least memorable dish. Then it was on the entrees, both of which were delicious. The half chicken I ordered was ridiculously good, with the honey brine giving the skin a vaguely sweet flavor that mixed so well with the natural juices from the meat. It's a ton of food, so be forewarned...but this was definitely a can't-miss dish from my view. My wife went with the poached lobster with corn, and while the corn preparation was a bit on the sweet side, the lobster was prepared to perfection. We then finished up with a very seasonal dish that was a lot of fun to eat - a mixture of large and small blackberries (I forget the proper terminology here), served with lemon curd and brown sugar for dipping. It's simple, not overly sweet, and a perfect way to end a meal at this restaurant in particular.

Although we didn't get a chance to make it here in the past, I am glad that we came, and whenever our next trip is, I will need to remember to book a reservation in advance so we can sit in the dining room! With a rotating menu - but with some favorites (like the half chicken and mussels) always on the menu, there is going to be something new - or an old favorite - to enjoy.

Staff was knowledgeable and great. Only snafu for us is that with our 8 month old baby, as there are no highchairs or accommodations for kids, it was slightly difficult to eat peacefully. But, maybe that is on purpose?

It is pretty basic from the outside - I walked by during the day and didn't notice it but once you walk in and the smell of the open wood burned envelops you - well I knew I was in a happy place.  We arrived early - like way early because it was raining and took a seat at the bar - Fore Street not only has great food the bar is excellent as well - can't get Allagash back home so kept it simple and my wife went one of the specialty cocktails with beet juice and was very happy - especially after the second.  Was called well before our reservation time (thanks) and a quick note - you should make a reservation as far in advance as possible)  Fore Street is intimate with exposed brick and wood with dim but not dark lighting.  The restaurant not only has an open kitchen, the prep area is in the wide open with a massive basket of fresh bread on view as you walk to the table with staff preps out salads, etc. - our table didn't look into the kitchen and it doesn't appear they have a chef table but would like to just watch them work.  So about the food - started with oysters - we live in the mid-west and super fresh isn't an option so local oysters are a treat and these were so fresh and delicious the mignonette was not necessary and in most places the oysters would have been the pre-entree highlight but then there was the sauteed squid with mushrooms - it appears that it is not always on the menu but if it is do not hesitate - just cooked through tender squid matched with sliced mushrooms was amazing.  Also ordered a fettuccine app - kind of weird as an appetizer but house made pasta in a light white wine sauce was kind of fantastic - just didn't see it coming.  So after three pre-dinner snacks listen to our waitress and order the Halibut steak served with potatoes in a ripping hot (their term) tiny cast iron skillet - it was a porcelain white inch thick piece of fish just cooked through that accentuated the fish spectacularly.  My wife also took the recommendation of the Scallops cooked with navy beans and sweet black rice with slices of white radish - I would have never considered that combination but now can't imagine them any other way.  So three apps, two entrees - no way dessert was happening - until the warm cherry rhubarb cobbler - with cinnamon basil ice cream - are you out of your mind - forget everything else that happened - Fore Street would get 5 stars just on the dessert.  We actually discussed trying to get back in the next night - I would not go to Portland with eating at Fore Street and neither should you.  Bonus for eating at Fore Street - your sweater will smell like roasty wood for several days - I actually picked mine up from the suitcase when I got home and relived the experience.",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

Luckily, the hostess got us at the bar when there was a last-minute cancellation. SCORE!

I know the menu changes on a daily basis, but they have standard items and I just thought it was weird when the waiter said he doesn't have any idea of how anything tasted. 

How does he not know how the standard plates tastes. and I know restaurants that offers a tasting to their waitstaff before serving time, so they are able to speak to the dishes.

It wasn't like that here. but our waiter Benson said everything was good here.

I am always reluctant to order mussels because a lot of places doesn't cook them properly. I asked him and he advised that they were good.

When the mussels arrived, they were huge and I have never seen them of that size.

I tasted them and I was just like grossed out by the texture and this is coming from an Asian. I can eat Uni, roe, sea cucumber and etc, but I just couldn't stomach this fluffy, super soft, and mushy type of mussels.

I called the waiter over and advised that the mussels tasted overcooked, but he advised the mussels supposed to take like this because of the type of mussels that are from Maine. He said it was because I am used to PEI mussels, but I am thinking I had moules from France, and mussels in Asia and Australia and I doubt they are all PEI mussels, since it wouldn't make sense for them to get them from Canada. But none of those oysters tasted like these mussels here.

The two tables next to us ordered mussels as well and I was dying to hear their thoughts, and the table to my left, had Benson as our waiter and when they ordered the mussels, he didn't mention anything to them in terms of size or anything after I complained about the texture.

The table to my right had a different waiter and he didn't mention anything either, but I wasn't there to witness the table to the left. however, I got to see the people's reaction on my right.

I saw the guy taking a bite of the mussels and he put his fork down and didn't say a word. He didn't reach for more, but his dinner partner took more mussels and ate them without a pause.

She raved about them, but he just nodded and as I observed, each time he took a mussel, he would chase it with his beer.

When their waiter came by, he asked how everything was going, and the guy said, these mussels are ""fluffy"" and big. 

Their waiter didn't mention anything about being the characteristic of this certain type of mussels, but he said the reason why they are bigger is because it is their spawning season.

I would definitely had appreciate if our waiter gave us this insight before ordering mussels and not lie and tell me it is because it's due to the Maine's mussels.

Everything else besides the mussels incident and our waiter were great!",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

Dessert was decadent, delicious, and delightful. I got the chocolate fudge torte and my boyfriend got the vanilla layer cake.

My girlfriend and I were there for a birthday celebration. Both our entrees were a disaster. She ordered halibut, which came out virtually raw. I ordered lamb, which was tough as shoe leather and extremely difficult to cut. I noticed that the woman seated next to me also ordered lamb and was having trouble cutting it. I also noticed that her presentation was entirely different than mine, even though we ordered the same dish. When I inquired to our waiter about that, he said that the kitchen places the entrées into whatever dish is available, so people get different presentations. Seriously? A $40 entrée and that's what you do?


By the time we finally finished our entrees, after I switched to chicken and my girlfriend's halibut was sent back and returned still not really cooked through, we were too disgusted to order dessert. 

Most telling was that our waiter and the hostess both apologized profusely, but only our $12 app was comped. No offer even of a glass of wine.

574,pT259QLwg1Pr16BCert1eA,fore-street,574,2017-12-14,"I REALLY wanted to give Fore Street five-stars. All of the reviews here are so amazing that I thought for sure I would have an equally exceptional experience, but I think this is a solid 3-3.5 star restaurant.
The food is very good, but it is not GREAT. We split two appetizers- a pork belly appetizer and the mussels. While the mussels were delicious (especially with a crusty piece of bread to sop up the sauce they are in), the pork belly really lacked in flavor, and was very tough to chew. Entrees were the half chicken and a duo of duck. Both were very flavorful, and no complaints on the execution of the cooking, but I just do not believe that the taste comes close to justifying the price of this meal.

Based on the a\\experience above, I would typically award this restaurant 4 stars, not 3. However, the entire time we were there we felt extremely put-off by our waitress. I don't know how to explain the vibe that she was sending, but it almost seemed like she thought we were going to try to run out on our bill? I'm not sure if we looked ""too young"" to be able to afford such an ""expensive"" meal (we are both almost 30), but I didn't appreciate being made to feel like we were somehow beneath the quality of such a prestigious establishment.
And not that it matters, but we were both dressed more than appropriately for the location (skirt/blouse for me, blazer/slacks/button-down) for my fiance. 

My advice to management would be to retrain the staff to respect the patrons more, and avoid the snooty, entitled attitudes.",4.0,3,"['288 Fore St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6581161918639,-70.2509852828992,"American (New), Seafood, "

I haven't seen a menu so great in....well....can't remember!

I was lucky enough to get a reservation here with only two weeks notice, barring it wasn't the ideal time my family wanted, but we are very glad we got to eat here.

I could write the longest review ever for this place, but i'll keep it as short as I can.  Hostest and waitress were super friendly and accommodating (since they don't do highchairs or anything, and my 13 month old niece cant just sit in a booth, ha.  We brought something with us, and it worked out great, and even the random times she was loud (hey, she's still a baby), no one complained or looked at us weird.  

We ordered a lot, almost too much between the six of us, but every single dish impressed.  I mean, every, single, dish...  There was nothing we ordered that we went ""that was just okay"", every dish was delicious, and fresh.  This really stays true to it's farm-to-table credo, and you can see it in the menu as it changes often as well.  The place itself is beautiful too, and they had a good beer and bourbon selection, I got my EH Taylor Barrel Proof!  

The big thing was the pacing of the food was great too, there were never more then 2-3 dishes on the table at a time.  Dinner was about 2-2.5 hours, and it didn't feel rushed or slow, was perfect.  This place fits in my Top 5 places that i've ever ate at.

I've never had mussels as good as the ones from Fore Street and the chicken is magical.

When we arrived they did not seem too busy. They quoted us 30 minutes which was fine by me. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink. The bartenders were a bit rude and pretentious! I told them that we were waiting for a table, or even 2 seats at the bar if they opened up. A few minutes later, one of the bartenders came over to us and said that it will be longer than 30 minutes since they forgot about a couple that was ahead of us. So, I finished my drink, spoke a few words to them letting them know how I felt about the situation and we left. All they had to do was accommodate us too for their mistake. I would have accepted an apology too or better yet a gift card. We all make mistakes, but if they tried to make up for it, I wouldn't be giving them 3 stars.

This was one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life. It bursts in your mouth with unmatched flavor and phenomenal texture. It's like an experience. Unbelievable! 

My only critique, however, is that the foie gras was a bit undercooked. Came out lukewarm, not seared long enough. It's an easily reparable faux pas, we could have sent it back to have them cook it longer.

I ordered the Hanger Steak medium rare. The steak looked perfectly cooked, but I took one bite it was room temperature at best. I informed the bartender, and he offered to have it warmed up for me. I declined as I didn't want the steak to come back overcooked.

- Wine list met expectations.  
- Absolutely awesome atmosphere.  Casual with wood-fired lighting and a consistently delicious aroma throughout the restaurant.  

What needs improvement:
- Service was very slow with bread taking multiple tens of minutes to be delivered when empty on two different occasions.  Server quite disengaged.  
- The primary reason Fore Street does not get five stars from me is dessert.  We ordered the soufflé and got a flourless chocolate cake in a soufflé dish, definitely not a soufflé!!

939,tEQCE_cnOAhQZ791XCkVtQ,scales,939,2019-04-22,"Just had dinner here for Easter Sunday. The atmosphere is wonderful, somehow both relaxed and higher end at the same time. There were people there in jeans and flanels as well as people like ourselves, nicely dressed (although it was a holiday, might not be the norm)  They have their daily catch on display at the front which is cool, it was even decorated for the occasion with an ice/snow-bunny and colored eggs. 

The wait staff is all very friendly, they clear in a timely manner and remove empty glasses/refill water basically without you noticing which is ideal. They're also very knowledgeable. My BF and I asked about the pronunciation of a certain fish since we've heard multiple ways over the years, and received a fascinating lesson about the fish, it's various names and how it varies by regions they can be found in. 

This place is right on the docks, so you can look out the windows and get a very classical Maine-type view from your table.  Sadly it was a bit foggy, so there wasn't as much to see as there normally would have been, but it was pretty  while it lasted. 

The wine list was great. I personally don't drink domestic wines; I find I can taste the higher sulfur content in wines from CA, so I prefer to drink imports. There were options from Spain, France, Denmark, New Zealand, along with several others.  Most options are by the bottle, but there are decent options sold by the glass.  They also have a great selection of local beers, ciders, and specialty cocktails made by the bar. 

We started with one of their artisinal bread options, Anadama, which was topped with salted butter and molasses.  OMG, so, sooooo good. The bread was fresh, and the balance of salty and sweet was perfect.

For dinner my BF ordered the halibut, which has hazelnuts, brown butter, lemon and potatoes with it. I took a bite and that was to die for. Perfectly cooked, nicely presented, and a great balance of favors.  I got the dorade (the fish we asked about, lol), which comes with lemon, almond butter, and seasoned with paprika and coriander. This was flayed table-side for me, by a new waiter who was training, all of maybe 15. Sweet kid, and he did an excellent job under the tutelage of the senior server who was helping him. Generally speaking, i didn't have too many bones to pick myself. The fish was cooked perfectly, not dry at all and again the pairing of flavors could not have been better. 

The dessert menu has some daily specials on it, but I got a chocolate frappe (childhood favorite on mine) and my BF got a wild blueberry frozen custard.

As I wasn't too hungry that day, I ordered the fluke ceviche and the daily special of duck agnolotti pasta appetizer as my dinner. If you really like the flavor and sweetness of pineapples, you will love the fluke ceviche. For me, I felt that the dish lacked acidity, and was more like fish in a very sweet sauce.

The duck agnolotti pasta with foie gras and morel mushrooms was on a totally different level, it was a dish bursting with umami and richness in comparison. The pasta was cooked al dente, and had a generous amount of filling. This was an appetizer sized pasta and it was the perfect portion size since it was so rich. I usually hate peas, but I loved the addition of peas on top as it was a nice burst of freshness in contrast to the creamy sauce. Order this if they have it available!

We came to Scales on a Tuesday night and were immediately sat. 
The ambiance was great, a nice restaurant but not overly fancy feeling and well lit. The kitchen is also an open concept and all of the oysters and fish is on ice at the front. 

We sat and each ordered glass of wine. The wine list was huge and really well priced. 
We started with 1/2 dozen oysters (2 of each that they have- they have 3 rotating choices- so we each got to have one of each). 
The oysters were very good and all local. 

For dinner, my friend ordered the seared scallops, which came with squash, pancetta, and kale in a delicious cream sauce. She orders scallops any time it's on a menu and said this was potentially  the best she's had. 
I ordered the seared tuna (part of the raw bar menu and an appetizer/small plate) and the Brussels sprouts side as a DIY entree. 
The tuna was perfectly seared and tasted so fresh. The Brussels sprouts were also great, shaved and cooked perfectly (browned) with big, delicious pieces of duck. 

Since everything was so great, we felt we had to have dessert. We ordered the chocolate crémeux, which was rich but accompanied with many things that balanced it out. We also had a dessert wine to go with it (Colosi Passito Mascato), which was fantastic. 

On top of everything, our server was so sweet and really helpful in guiding us through ordering.

This is the restaurant you take someone to impress, especially out of towners. It's a gorgeous, wide open new building directly on the ocean. There's really no discussion...this is the most stunning restaurant in the city of Portland and should be your first choice as a seafood destination. It's a class above a place like Eventide and a much better atmosphere than sister restaurants Street and Co. and Fore Street. 

With the above being said, as a local, I wouldn't come for entrees again unless someone else is paying. At $32-$38 for most items, which includes only a minimal side, it's just too expensive for anything besides a special occasion. The arctic char, haddock and hake were all excellent, and about as good and fresh as you'll find in the city. If you're visiting Portland, stop reading and make a reservation (and you'll definitely need one).

For me, the happy hour and/or bar is a great up""scale"" (couldn't resist) year round choice. It's a gorgeous stone bar and oysters are shucked directly in front of you on a pile of ice placed in a crevice. From 4 pm-6 pm in winter, it's $1 oysters with various wine and beer options at $6. The appetizers, priced $9-$16, are much more reasonable and great for sharing. In order of preference:
-Mussels: a massive portion in an oversized cast iron skillet with perhaps the best bread I've ever tasted, baked across the street at Standard.
-Seared Tuna: melts in your mouth. I can't think of a better version, anywhere.
-Fried Cauliflower: decent, but not exceptional. Similar items at Central Provisions are better.
-Salt Cod Croquettes: too salty for my taste.
-On different visits, the fried clams and fried squid have been excellent.

Each day that I was at work I was told 3-4 times that I needed to try and get into this place to eat. I was fortunately able to get a reservation late one night right before they closed. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful with helping me decide what to eat off their menu. The server suggested a special appetizer that they had that night which was a fried branzino on top of sweet/spicy slaw. I went with his suggestion and ordered that and then also ordered 3 raw oysters and 3 raw clams since I had never tried either raw before. My main dish I ordered was the Seared Scallop entree. 

The fried branzino was phenomenal. Like easily one of the best appetizers I had during my business trip. The branzino wasn't super heavy feeling and the slaw was really tasty. The raw oysters and clams were presented on a very appealing platter. I just however decided raw oysters and clams aren't for me and that is nothing against Scales.

The scallops were seared to perfection and the combination of mushrooms, bacon, spinach, and parsnip cream sauce was delicious.

We were looking for a dinner spot during our quick trip in Maine that would have a nice menu of classic lobster dishes, soups, and some other seafood dishes. This place fit the bill and boy did it not disappoint!

We did not have reservations on a Saturday evening but were able to get seated within 5 minutes - though this may have been due to the rainy weather and maybe not being as busy, it was very nice that we didn't have to wait a while. 

As soon as you walk in you're greeted by a huge
Box of frozen seafood on display and a nice open seating space (big windows with views of the water) - It reassures you that you're in for a fresh dining experience. 

We ordered clam chowder, lobster stew, grilled octopus, crab fritters as our appetizers, and steamed lobster and scallop dish as our entrees. Baked Alaska and frozen blueberry custard as dessert. Everything was so delicious especially the entrees and the octopus and crab fritter appetizers! The fritter was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside full of crab flavor. The sauces for all the dishes were very complementary and you can tell care was taken into every bite and presentation.

The restaurant itself is lovely with lots of windows and sunlight.  Free valet parking makes it very convenient.

My family was up in Portland for vacation so we were a party of 12.  I looked at the menu ahead of time online and was excited about the short rib and duck entrees.  While it's a seafood restaurant, I wasn't in a seafood mood.  When we were seated, I was disappointed to not see the entrees that I saw online, but know menus are subject to change so I didn't think anymore of it.  I was avoiding shellfish and am lactose intolerant so my choices were limited, especially with no changes to the entrees.  I settled on the sockeye salmon which was over cooked and salty.  Most of my family enjoyed their dishes however.  

As we were wrapping up, we noticed someone at the next table got the whole fried fish.  It wasn't on our menu so that's when we asked our waitress how that table got the dish.  She then explained the rule of a limited menu for parties of 12 or more... and that it should have been explained when the reservation was made.  I didn't make the reservation so not sure if it was properly explained.  Since they were a party of 8, they got the regular menu.  

Whether the limited menu was explained or not, I think it's bullshit that a party that is spending more money doesn't get to order what they want.  From what I recall, the limited menu does not include the whole fried fish, seafood stew, duck, short rib, or any of the sandwiches.  We had 3 kids with us and my sister had even asked if there was a kids menu / smaller portions and our waitress said no, knowing that the ""regular menu"" offered sandwiches that would be better portioned for kids.  So instead of being able to get the fish sandwich with fries my young nephew had to go with the full order of fish and chips.  And instead of getting the short ribs, I was getting something I didn't want.

When you drop $800 at a restaurant, you expect more and you expect to be treated equally and not considered as an inconvenience to the kitchen.

Anadama bread- a bread so delicious already its hard to mess up, which they did not. Amazing slice of corn meal and molasses heaven
Fried oysters- I had never had oysters fried before because they are so good raw why mess with a good thing? However these were amazing.
Steamed clams- I don't know how, but these clams had the biggest bellies I've ever had with clams, and we didn't even need to clean them in clam water!
Tempura soft shell crab- So good
Halibut tartine- still not sure what tartine is but this was good

In other words, you come here mostly because it is right on the pier and has giant windows looking out over the water.

We shared an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts and the desserts were really all that was memorable (to be honest, I can't even remember what my husband ordered as an entree!).  My scallop dish was gorgeous, and the portion more than generous, but I've had much better scallops in Portland.  Entrees are in the $30 range, and in this city, I expect to be wowed for that price.  The desserts, on the other hand, are fantastic.  They are similar in quality to those at Fore Street, which is my favorite place to get fancy dessert.

The interior of the restaurant is sleek and modern and has high Windows perfect for watching the sunset right on the ocean. The cornbread was lovely and warm and very cute. I do wish they'd brought us three though since we were a party of three and they only brought 2. The smoked salmon appetizer was average. The salmon was fresh enough but the star of the dish was the farm tomatoes. The scallops were delicious - I enjoyed the corn that added lightness but found the overall dish too heavy with the dairy or butter sauce. The halibut was average. Definitely not a problem with the portion but the fish felt over cooked and drowned in butter and sauce. The lack of green on the plate also felt heavy and without a new texture or break from the fish. The steak was fine and the potatoes were well cooked but I wouldn't order it again.

The place was busy (late on a Tuesday) but we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt in taking our drink order. We looked through the menu and decided to sample some items from the raw bar as well as the regular menu. First course included oysters (all Maine and all 3 types were exceptional) tuna tartare, octopus with chorizo and clam chowder. The chowder was simply divine and the tartare was so fresh and so well balanced it might be the best I've ever tasted.  The hands down favorite, though, was the octopus. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and ever so subtly balanced in flavors with the chorizo, hazelnuts and a balsamic reduction. So. Amazing. Everything came out quickly and was served promptly. 

Entrees were a bit less adventurous, though equally delicious. We ordered both steamed and roasted lobsters as well as the baked haddock. The lobsters were amazing (no surprise) and the baked lobster is absolutely something that should be on any foodie's bucket list. Rich, savory texture and flavor topped with crunchy breadcrumbs - so good. But the star entree was the haddock. Served in a cast iron gratin with morels, fingerling potatoes and leeks swimming in a rich delicious cream sauce - this dish was pure heaven. I'd go back just for this. Seriously. It was the most ingenious presentation of haddock I've ever seen. 

We decided to sample dessert as well - blueberry crumble and a butterscotch sundae. Both were incredibly good. The crumble was warm and comforting and topped with delicious vanilla ice cream. The sundae was equally good and came topped with caramel popcorn. Such an amazing idea.

I would never have a reason to come to Scales. The menu is almost entirely meat/seafood products. And well it should be with a name like ""Scales"" and a location *literally* on the water. But I was tipped off that they were serving some of the best dessert in Portland, so... 

The first time we came was late on a Thursday and we asked the host if we could just grab dessert and cocktails, he told us the bar was open for that. ""Could we maybe sit by the windows instead? We're having a date night!"" He didn't seem to like that request much. Dismissively he said, ""the answer is always no if you're not going to eat dinner"" (side note: seriously?!), ""but I'll let you this one time because we're not slammed.""

Not the best first impression, I'll tell you that much.

We were seated by the windows and, despite it being dark out, still got to watch a lobsterman set-up his boat for the next morning. Their location is offering hands-down one of the best views in the whole city. Being out on - and almost at level with - the pier like that is something incredibly special. Try to come here for dusk sometime; it's a breathtaking experience.

We heard the cheesecake was out of this world, and it changes seasonally. We were told that for the holidays/winter it's Spiced Autumn Cheesecake (with cider caramel, harvest granola, and a maple flavored whip cream) for $9.00. A bit steep, but well worth it - it tasted exactly like one would hope it would given the listed flavor profiles. I think this was in the top three cheesecakes I've ever had; well worth the price tag. And, come to find out they make all their desserts in house. Then again, why wouldn't they? The folks who own this place are also the same people behind Standard Baking Company. This alone makes me want to come back to order the cornbread with salted honey butter... I wonder if I would be forced to sit at the bar if I only ordered sides though?

The drinks were also amazing: my partner got the ""West End"" (whiskey, fernet, bitters, and orange) and claims it's one of the best, most balanced drinks he's had in a long time. I got the ""Autumn Sangria Infusion"" (red wine, herbs, spices) and it was good - it wasn't cloyingly sweet or as heavy as I was expecting and as such made for a solid nightcap choice.",4.0,3,"['68 Commercial St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65735,-70.25003000000001,"American (New), Seafood, "

It's a long rectangular room that gets full up as quick as the guests fill up on the freshest the sea has to erp up. If they gave you a shovel and a pail instead of utensils, I'd be happy. I'd even be happy going all cave man with no cutlery or plates. So there. 

The decor is ceiling to floor glass so it's like eating in a fish bowl, which is most appropriate given the menu and location next to where the daily catch is off loaded. The menu is not for guppy tummies, either. Sure, you can order dishes by the half but they are still ample for a fisherman's hunger. I suggest you bag the half biz and step/swim up to the task at hand. Wow factor food.    

The place is what Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco could've been instead of the third stop in the air conditioned motor coach (full of oddly dressed tourists) to buy an octopus coffee mug or a ball cap in the shape of a shrimp. 

Scales is a sophisticated yet casual, light, airy and open space. There are lots of tables with elbow room to work that lobster like they was payin' you to eat it. There's a Raw Bar and a Long Bar (at least 100 feet...could be imbibing is the local past time), to enjoy the full bar options. 

Feel free to discount the opinion of Yelpers who only gave 3 stars, dragging the overall average down as one complained at being asked to wait in the bar for 10 minutes. It ain't like a segregation at Gitmo, bisides this place is busy for a reason. Or the one who dissed the joint because he/she/it didn't like sea food. Yo, what was you thinkin? Re-read the name of the place, you enter through a boat door, and the place is drippin' with lures for decor. Go ahead, order the Short Rib Pot Roast but don't roast the place because you don't like fish. You probably wouldn't like Rome either because it has too many old buildings.

The Vibe: Low key. Locals, yocals, and out of towners (and some Yelping downers),

The Bar Program: Lot's of crafty brews, a few ciders for orchard insiders, and an extensive wine list with many by the glass choices. The signature cocktails tend to be on the sweet side So? Just like our server Mikela who was truly sweet, helpful, humorous and enthusiastic. 

The Bug Light was a flute of boozy fruit (which describes half the patrons at the Red Velvet Lounge in OC). Eight Bells Rum, Barrel Aged Maple Syrup, OJ and Brut (as opposed to O.J. the Brute). 

The Fort Sumter was Tanguerey Gin, Muddled Fig, and Fresh Lime served up. Now fully muddled and addled myself, let's eat. 

The Food: This is Sea-forward dining. Duh! Right in the harbor where the fishermen deliver the sea's bounty daily. This is a working restaurant featuring the freshest and best of God's little swimming creatures this side of the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. Nothing here that's been fried even knows it's been fried. No residue, no oil, no puddle of rendered fish fat on your plate, nothing heavy here so order a pile of whatever sings to you. All good. 

Whole Belly Clams. These puppies were flash fried and served with Smoked Jalapeno Aioli and Lemon. Most places don't bother with the bellies (unless you're at a bar in Vegas). Usually you get only strips (also something reminiscent of Vegas). Here, you get the entire clam corpse, fried by an expert. Each belly had a crisp coating form fitting crunch surrounding a briny juicy little treasure. (Yeah, you can find that in Vegas too, but it will cost.)

The Special off menu offering the night I dined there was Diver Scallops. They too were fried, but it just seemed so right, and besides isn't America's favorite flavor crispy? Generally, scallops are too delicate to fry but the line cook manning that station had earned his fins, gills and tail badge and was truly a Fry Master...and I ain't shuckin' you, neither. And it came with a small hill of fries, done just right...my guilty pleasure. 

The Lobster Roll is a local legend as well. Oh, what a sweet fresh lobster! Look close and make sure in ain't still wigglin' in your bun (figuratively speaking). It is nestled in a split top, house baked, butter grilled roll, filled to over flowing with the crustacean that would drive a Rabbi off the Kosher cart. Served simply with Chives and Mayo, oh, I say, oh how wonderful was that little roll in the Bay? 

Dessert: No complaining that your own clam belly is obscuring the view of your shoes. Have the Concord Grape and Apple Pie baked in it's own ramekin with a crust as flaky as the current Presidential Transition Team.

Hazelnut halibut: this dish was so flavorful and different. The brown buttery sauce had a ton of whole hazelnuts and was drizzled over a very large halibut filet. There were a few fingerling potatos added to the dish that were also great

There is no better case in point than with Scales, a new, exciting restaurant on the Maine Wharf trying to achieve in its first year what all fine restaurants offer- my wife and I managed a reservation for the first time last night, though we live a scant three miles out in Casco Bay. From the raw oysters at the bar to the ginger cake dessert this was a wonderful experience- here are some tips for you: don't arrive feeling the world owes you a thing; have a reservation or content yourself with remaining at the bar, sampling appetizers, and promising yourself you will return. Ask your server what's good- they know. Look around you and feel what it is they are doing, from the music to the families to the fresh catches on display- realize the seafood is largely brought in from next door, not even trucked from across town. If you want a red carpet, boot-licking, and deferential bows, go to Manhattan.

Two recent ferry trips across the bay to our favorite restaurant- (how do they ALWAYS seem to find a table for us?) - the scallops carpaccio is a must try- one of you at table should order it, pass it around for each a taste, then ask your server how many scallops are used to make the dish. (!)

1898,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1898,2019-03-02,"A few weeks ago, a few friends and I decided to meet up at Union for some pre-dinner cocktails. Having never been to Union before, I was excited to experience their venue, as I have walked passed it numerous times.

Upon entering, Union has a modern, American-restaurant aesthetic with wooden floors, modern lighting fixtures and contrasts of black throughout the venue. Union has an expansive bar to sit at with some couch-like bar seating, and a variety of other table seating. On a Saturday night, the bar was definitely popular and busy, which I am assuming is due to Union being in the same building as the Press Hotel. It seemed as though people were coming in to stop for a quick drink before they started making their rounds around the city. 

However, my friends and I opted for the open couch seating by the bar and were quickly greeted by the bar waitress. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and provided AMAZING service. I ordered an extra dirty martini, which was made to perfection, and a couple other friends ordered from the cocktail menu and when they came out, they were presented nicely.

After some time by the bar area, my friends and I figured we might as well stay and try some of Union's dinner options. We were seated in the dining area and again, were quickly greeted by our waitress. Perusing the menu, Union certainly highlights seafood options, which makes sense due to the tourists that stay at the hotel, but they also have a few other protein options beyond seafood. I ended up getting the truffled pot roast, which was served in a small cast iron skillet with vegetables, broth, and some grated horse radish. The flavor profile was amazing and everything was working together nicely. My only negative was that the pot roast was slightly fatty. My friends enjoyed their dishes which included the filet, the scallops, and the salmon.

I ended the night with one of my friends and I sharing the chocolate dolvino, which was a decadent chocolate pudding with pieces of chocolate fudge-like pieces in it. It was incredibly good!

In general, I think Union has a lot to offer. Why not five stars? I think their prices are exponentially inflated for what they are offering.

I chose the truffled pot roast for my entree.  Some members of my family expressed their surprise that I did not pick something ""fancier"" but I had a good feeling about this.  I was definitely right..... beautifully tender meat and a truffled jus that was fantastic!

On a lark, I went here on a business lunch and it's the perfect venue for such an outing. I could see it being a cosy place for two friends sharing a lunch break also. During the day, it does not strike me as romantic but at night, it could be. 

We ordered the truffle oil potato chips with ranch dip for an appetizer and they. are. rich. Do not order these for ""something light.""  They are incredible and tasty; excellent balance of salt and creamy if you use that homemade ranch dipping sauce. A table of four will polish them off, but for two people, it's a challenge. 

For lunch, I got the burger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, cheese, and ""Union sauce.""  It was a great burger, moist and fresh and cooked well. The English muffin as the bun was the let down. It took away from what could have been an outstanding burger! It was dry and flavorless. Give us a pretzel bun or Kaiser roll or just a sesame hamburger bun and it'll make all the difference. The Union sauce was unknown but it complimented the meats/cheese/veggies well. 

It comes with a salad (which after the chips I should have gotten) or fries. I opted for the fries and THEY ARE FRENCH FRIED FINGERLING POTATOES!! Cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly, I was so happy to have gotten them--despite my fried food overload. 

I ordered coffee too. It's good. Have no idea if it's Sanka or Tandem or CBD or what, but a good cup of joe is a good cup of joe, ifyouknowhatImean. 

Our server was delightful. I'd give her a shout out but I can't remember her name. Very attentive-never let our water deplete! A+++ for that.

Started off with the ""local favorites"" seared tuna. $18 for 4 pieces of seared tuna with not enough sauce and too much garlic oil on the slaw. Too many competing and contrasting flavors, dish didn't know what it wanted to be. Skip. 

Then had the braised lobster with corn fritters and Summer corn chowder. I basically chose this restaurant for this dish, because these are three of my favorite things to eat! Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Lobster was cooked perfectly, but the corn fritters were extremely salty and dry. Also no corn kernels to be found! I've found that the best corn fritters often have actual pieces of corn in them. Dish left more to be desired. 

Boyfriend had the crab pasta, which was the best dish we tried. Wish I had ordered that instead. But it came with mint on top, which was very unsettling. 

Ended with the deconstructed whipped cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, would highly recommend!

There is a very unique texture to this dish and trust me, you'll go back for more or you'll try hard to make not so perfect pasta for this very reason. 

Appetizers are creative (shrimp and hominy) will be a great start or try the brussels... in s category completely of their own. Huge Brussels sprouts fan here so I love to see what a chef can do with them... these guys nailed it.

So pretty and tasted beyond what I thought a pasta could taste like. My companion really enjoyed his swordfish special and said it was the best he had ever had. 

Two things that keep this from being a five star review: The first is that the dessert I had was honestly ""meh"". I had the Union M&M's standing for macarons, madeleines, and meringues. While generous in amount (two of each dessert), each item tasted like it was store-bought and not all that unique. The madeleines were very dry and had no taste to them, while the macarons were hard and crunchy instead of light and airy. Definitely wouldn't order this again. 

The second is that a few days after the dinner went through on my credit card, I noticed that the total of my bill was slightly higher than what I wrote down on my slip. It was just a few dollars more, so nothing that's going to wipe me out, but it does seem a bit dishonest that the server would think its okay to add more money to her tip, when I didn't write that amount down. Maybe pay in cash next time to avoid being swindled.

It also was located in our hotel, the Press Hotel.  The restaurant itself has a contemporary feel. There's a dining area and a bar area. I was underwhelmed by the service received at this restaurant.  The young gentleman serving us seem like we were a bother.  As a waitress in my younger years, I notice good service and I expect a server to approach the table and introduce himself. That did not happen.  I was very surprised as we received nothing but special and courteous treatment from the staff members of the hotel. My husband and I started with a couple cocktails from the bar and ordered two of the appetizers. The seared goat cheese and the roasted carrots, both were delicious.  I was, however, disappointed that the carrots only had six colorful petite carrots on the plate.  I ordered the scallops for my dinner and my husband had the special fish of the night. He enjoyed his entrée. I loved the fennel that was served with my three scallops. They were perfectly grilled and tender. Again, the food was good but the service was lacking. I had no refill on my water until after I was finished with my meal.  I expect more from a restaurant that charges these prices. I expect to be waited on by a friendly and attentive staff member who introduces themselves, which did not happen. For my last night in Portland, I wanted this to be a special meal and that is why I chose Union.  The dinner we had at David's restaurant in Portland was so much better as we were treated wonderfully and waited on attentively.

I just can't seem to make it work, though.

If I was from out of state and was coming to Portland, there's a good chance this is one of the hotels I would end up at. And, who knows, maybe I would check out Union for breakfast (which I *still* hear is amazing years later, and am *still* going to try one of these days) or a cocktail and love it. But... as a local who knows some of the great locations throughout the city for food, drink, and service, this place continues to underwhelm me. Despite the many times I've now been here, I always leave wishing I had chosen a different bar. 

+/- Cocktails 
During the winter they've got this fig and walnut concoction that might be one of the best in the city; unfortunately, they're pretty strict about only making what's on their current menu. Recently I had a $14 cocktail that was 2/3 full and tasted of watered-down lime juice (it was even greenish in color). Frustrating since I bought something that was supposed to be bourbon, apple brandy, and cinnamon simple syrup. My friend's cocktail tasted like a warm melted chapstick. They both were bad enough that after one sip I asked her if she wanted to go to a different bar. I would have liked to talk to the bartender about our drinks, but... 

- Service
At my latest experience, the bartender wasn't personable or attentive at all. At least not to us. We ordered two rounds of drinks, and both times they seemed to come out staggered (we're talking twenty or so minutes between her drink and mine arriving). Beyond that, he wouldn't look at us when taking or delivering our orders - he was fixated on a large group of business men just behind us. Weird thing to note, I know, but it's weirder to be ""talking"" to someone who's looking past your shoulder at other people. And when explaining our drinks and food, he literally walked away mid-sentence (multiple times) to take care of someone else. So... not feeling especially wanted here.

- Food
I still can't wrap my brain around that cheese plate being almost $20. Yes, it's definitely more ample and balanced then it was when they first opened, but I've had cheese plates at nearly every place in town, and have had just as good or better for far cheaper and more plentiful. It's definitely not worth the price tag.

I'm so sorry, Union. I just don't get it. I don't know if it's me. If it's you. If it's me plus you. I will absolutely give it another go, though, because I'm determined to make us work... but first, I just need to get the taste of this lime drink out my mouth.",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "

For one, it's restaurant week, and they are listed on the Maine Restaurant Week website. When they called to confirm the reservation, and restaurant week was inquired about, the man on the phone said it was the ""chef's surprise."" Oh? Maybe I'll surprise the chef with anaphylactic shock in return. Ok, well, no big deal; one can always ask more questions upon arrival. 

Upon arrival, the table wasn't ready. Fortunately, I am always happy to drink my night away, so I asked for my numbing-concoction-of-choice: Maker's on the rocks. Had I not spewed out that decision at the speed of lightning as I always do, the bartender didn't come back around for a while. Granted, he was busy, just not very personable. Maybe I wasn't there with the right person to enjoy myself. There were couples to my left and right who seemed to be sexually active with one another, so I guess I should just be happy for them. 

When the table was ready, we closed out and moved.  Our waitress was really friendly. She didn't mention restaurant week, but I asked for menu items, and she did deliver. I thought they paled in comparison to all other local restaurant-week menus because there was only one (as opposed to three) options. I think they are a little misleading to say they partake in restaurant week, but then once you arrive it's ""we always have a tasting menu available.""

The cheese plate was eh. I tried the three cheeses and only didn't want to barf on one of them.   One was cheddar-like and the others were very potent varieties, which aren't my taste. The parsnip soup I didn't partake in. The brussel sprouts were great, and my favorite part of the night. Meal: I had the pork shank. It was fine. It was luke warm and under salted, and I could never quite get my waitress' attention, so I gave up and ordered another drink. Other dish: Scallops. They were good, and quite oppositely salted compared to my dish.  Had to say no to dessert, so I can't judge that category.

5 star for service.

What was less than stellar was the food. Given the high star rating and beautiful interior, i was expecting similarly amazing food.

The best things?
- zucchini crab cakes -phenomenal, fresh and not at all oily
- salad - ask delicious and fresh
- burrata - super creamy with a little jolt of weirdness with the presence of raisin like fruit
- salmon - very fresh and well seared 

Okay, not great
- corn with potatoes - this didn't work for me. The corn was light and fresh but the potatoes tasted starchy and mushy and so than texture didn't complement the crisp corn
- pot roast - disappointing; lacked flavor and salt. The root vegetables were bland
- cookies -these ""house made"" cookies tasted like cheap store bought pecan sundies and chips ahoy and Costco madeleines.
- house bread - this is obviously very rustic but was a little too hearty. Felt like I was eating super high fiber spelt bread
- tofu pesto risotto - okay, probably my fault for ordering such a dish but I wanted to try something different. This was a fail - why tofu at all? Wrong texture. Pesto was made from arugula which made it unbearably bitter without the fragrance of basil.

For the snack we ordered the chicken liver pate.

The chicken liver pate came out on a thick piece of grilled bread that was cut into thirds and had a side of mushrooms and a runny egg. The pate was chilled but with the warm bread, egg and mushrooms it was perfect. Even my boyfriend who is completely anti liver couldn't help trying it and was pleasantly surprised.

My wine was very expensive at $16 a glass, but it was also one of the best ones I've ever had.

I stayed because of the Yelp reviews. I sat in the bar area, a bit cold with the door continually opening and closing. They have a chefs table I could have moved to but I felt bad knowing the tip for the meal would go to someone other than the nice staff who had been serving me.

I was seated by the friendly host and provided with three menus...two of which were for alcohol. I was surprised to see that the only menu available at 1:45pm on a Sunday was the Brunch menu, I always thought of Brunch as being earlier in the day, but I was thankful I had eaten a hearty breakfast of an ""Andrew's Behemoth"" at Fernald's Country Store in Damariscotta two hours before, on my trip from the Lincoln County down in to Portland. 

At Union i ordered the Baby Arugula salad which had a delicate flavor and texture, save for the green tomatoes which were a bit too green and hard for my liking. The charred corn, and other parts of the salad were fantastic though and I would order it again.

I followed this up with the Spanish Tortilla which is essentially an omelette. I subbed chicken for the chorizo as I'm not a fan of pro and found the omelette to be acceptable. I'm not a big omelette fan but it was the only thing that I could get on the menu which is incredibly small - Duckfat has more options. The wheat toast that came with the egg dish however was quite good and there sure was no shortage of mix ins within the omelette which made for a hearty dish. 

I was really looking forward to one of their sandwiches and was very disappointed to not see any of the menu during my trip.

1969,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1969,2016-10-10,"We went to Union last night after looking at multiple different options. It was our first night in Portland and we thought the reviews were promising - and let me tell you, I don't regret going at all. 

I got the three course tasting menu, and my girlfriend got three courses to match so that the timing we consistent. The tasting menu last night was mushroom based which was amazing. The chef came and told us about it and I was immediately sold. The staff was welcoming and the ambiance was warm and friendly (the press Hotel is also beautiful). 

I started wth a mushroom frisée salad with local apples and sherry. It was beautiful light and delicious with hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the crispy Brussels sprouts with walnuts and she didn't speak to me because she was too busy enjoying the food! That's when you know it's delicious. Our entrees were taking awhile, but we were too busy speaking to really notice - however the chef sent over a mini course for us (complimentary) of a cauliflower purée with muscles. This unexpected course was actually the best delight of the entire night. It was as my girlfriend said, ""one of the lightest and most flavorful dishes"" she's ever had! 

As an entree we I had wagyu beef with all kinds of locally foraged mushrooms and fingerling potatoes and my girlfriend had salmon with beets. Both were wonderful. 

The whole experience, including desserts was well worth the money and time. Most importantly, I'd encourage trusting the chef with the tasting menu and follow the recommendations of the staff!

The restaurant was empty except for a 3 top in the dining room. We didn't see a hostess, a waitress or bartender. After several minutes, a bartender (or barback?) appeared and started pouring ice into the bar directly in front of us. He didn't not look up, doesn't say hello, and doesn't acknowledge our existence at all. I see the chef and make eye contact, but he quickly returns to what he's doing.

We patiently wait even longer watching the bartender unload ice and not look at us. After waiting another several minutes, we start to feel completed ignored and contemplate leaving, which we never do. Having come from the restaurant industry, we can make a lot of excuses, but this was unacceptable. 

We walk out with a feeling no customer should ever have, unwelcome. I get that this place is super fancy now, but this is no way to treat any customer, especially ones that would have dined well and probably would have come back if it was as good as they say. 

I guess we'll never know. Good luck getting noticed at this place.

1975,XyUA6Yt9AYcbEs1WYd_aDg,union,1975,2017-05-01,"I apologize in advance for the novel, but I want you, reader, to know just how incredible this meal, and very special night, was. 

Saturday evening my fiancé (though she didn't know it yet) sat down for our dinner at Union. First off, given that I'd be proposing at the end of that meal I'd been in close communication with the staff in making arrangements so that this meal would be perfect, and it needs to be said that they were incredibly accommodating and kind through the whole process. 
To that effect, when we walked in, we were met by a very friendly host who led us to our table, where a bottle of delicious sparkling rosé was waiting, chilling, for us. Our server, was bubbly and informative, quickly and easily answered all of our questions and smoothly transitioned us into our meal. 
The first course was a season cheese plate that featured a cloth bound cheddar, a mild yet dynamic bleu, and this incredible triple creme whose name I sadly can't remember (even sadder now that I realize I can't track it down to buy without a name), a fig jam, whipped local honey, and toasted walnuts. That bleu was delicious, but the triple creme was easily one of the most delicious cheeses I've consumed, with the ash line running through its center adding a delightful smokiness. 
After the cheeses we ordered the caramelized lamb belly served over white beans, toasted pistachios, and roasted garlic purée, and all I can say is that if a mouth could orgasm, it would with this dish. The lamb's belly was wound like a pinwheel and had a delightful, sweet, crisp to its outside before you make it to the buttery, herbed, and lightly gamey inner layers. The beans were sweet and earthy and were beautifully complimented by the warmth of the pistachios, and the garlic purée was just that perfect extra touch that tied it all together. 
The mains were equally decadent, flavorful, and intricate. I ordered the chef's interpretation of a Surf 'n turf: seared scallops with braised ox tail, roasted shallots, and some sort of a pea purée. Magic. Pure magic. The brine of the scallops melded perfectly with the grounded sweetness of the ox tail, as the smokey, near caramel, notes of the roasted shallots balanced any remaining bite of the other flavors. All in all, an absolutely incredible dish!
Last but not least, dessert. Having just proposed after the last dish, the restaurant brought out a small, yet decadent, plate of treats for us. At the bottom was a truly out-of-this world chocolate cake. Stacked above that was a bar of semi-frozen chocolate moussed that was airy and dissolved on your tongue; next to those two was a shard of cocoa-nib meringue, jutting from a dollop of fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream. Each element on its own was delicious, but the real fun came in combining them in various configurations. Additionally, the desserts were paired with a lovely sweet Argentinian dessert wine, much like a port, but cleaner. 

All in all, between the extraordinary staff, and equally incredible food, Union is a culinary experience that no one should miss, and is particularly well suited to those who want a romantic, and truly special, night to remember.",4.0,2,"['390 Congress St', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6590327,-70.25651540000001,"Breakfast & Brunch, American (New), Seafood, "

It always fell WAY short, to the point where I had to put a caveat in the band's rider, no New Orleans food without checking with the management first. As a result, I am always a little dubious of restaurants outside the Crescent City, claiming to be the real deal. I decided to give Po Boys and pickles a shot, the menu seemed authentic enough, and when I walked in, it had all the right trappings of a Nola-centric restaurant. 

I decided to get the muffaletta, a classic Nola sandwich made famous by the Central Market and others. It is basically an Italian cold cut sandwich with an olive salad. It usually has mortadella, salami, capicola, and a good provolone cheese. I figured with ""pickles"" in their name, they would have a really great olive salad.  The sandwich was a major disappointment, the olive salad was barely discernable on the sandwich, about all you could taste in it was oregano. The cold cuts were bland American, mostly ham, and the provolone cheese was more like a very mild colby.  The sandwich came toasted, unlike a real muffaletta, and there was also lettuce and tomato, not typically found on the traditional version. All in all, it was like a typical ""American Cold Cut"" sub, nothing remotely New Orleans about it. Also, the $7.50 1/2 loaf was pretty small by New Orleans standards, but I'm glad I didn't pop for the full loaf for 15.00

We came back for the first time in probably 6 months. It was average. It filled the void of wanting something in the neighborhood without heading into town. 

We got there before the rush, so the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered the cheeseburger po' boy, the atomic special and a side order of fries. It might have been our fault for ordering the special, but it felt as though it was advertised as a grilled cheese. We were amped about that and then somewhat let down. No part of the description said ""burger"" was in it. This meant we ended up with two burger sandwiches to share and totally were not expecting that. The cheeseburger po' boy is our go-to. You get a lot of meat for the cheap cost of $6 for a regular. 

I can't really decide what the deal is with the fries. Some taste salty and some taste sweet. I am not a fan of sweet fries (and no I don't mean sweet potato), so that was a bit of a setback.

Just to put it into perspective, he brought a cooler with ice packs so we could bring some food back to Massachusetts. You do crazy things for the food you love.

First of all, I love their sign. It has a cute little pickle on it that looks like it was designed fifty years ago. Super funky and old-school.

The restaurant itself is certainly nothing to write home about stylistically. It's a counter with some tables and high-tops inside and some picnic tables outside. 

BUT THE FOOD!
I got the Uptown which included falafel, roasted red peppers and onions, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and red pepper mayo. This is THE BEST falafel I have ever had. It's flat like miniature hockey pucks, not round how it is typically served and it is not dry in the slightest. The center was green and tender and the spice mixture was out of this world.

He got the Dirty Bird which included roasted chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and garlic mayo.
We also got a side of fried pickles which were unique and ridiculously good; they peel their pickles and fry the slivers so each piece is crispy and thin. The portion was so large we could hardly finish it.

It is also worth noting that the bread here is INSANE- flaky French bread you have to try to believe.

We ended up buying a Dirty Bird and a quart of pickles to take back to Massachusetts with us (in a cooler, I kid you not). We also got T-shirts for $15 each. They don't have women's sizes so I had to get a men's small which is huge on me. They were able to find him a large, but it took some digging in their back room. It might be a good idea to expand their inventory to include merchandise for women as well as ordering higher quantities of the more common sizes.

Ten minutes go by, then twenty, then thirty. I ask what is taking so long? They say our order is two back.

We've passed by this place so many times but when Susan's was closed, we decided to try it out. We ordered fried pickles and two po' boys. My fiance got the Debris, whereas I got the Surf and Turf. They're essentially the same po' boy, but the Surf and Turf comes with fried shrimp. 

The pickles came first, and boy were they delicious. The batter is cornmeal-based and complements the pickles so well. Probably one of the best renditions of fried pickles I've ever had. The remoulade sauce that went with it was great as well. 

The po' boys were a disappointment. As much as I wanted to like them, they just didn't taste like the po' boys I was used to. There weren't enough condiments on top, so the sandwich itself was dry. The debris needed more flavor. It tasted like it was missing something. I ended up having to add ketchup and mayo to my po' boy to give it a little more oomph. The portion sizes were very generous, but I just wasn't feeling it and didn't want to take my leftovers home. 

The place itself is really neat. Clean, fun, and unpretentious atmosphere. The servers were super nice. Their menu sounds delicious, with tons of Zapp's flavors on offer and milkshakes and bread pudding for dessert.

The Boudin Balls tasted really good, and the mustard dipping sauce that went with them paired nicely.  They seemed to be quite small in comparison to the boudin balls that I have had before, but with the smaller size they were easier to eat while driving :)
My wife thoroughly enjoyed the Gumbo.  It wasn't too spicy, had lots of flavor, and lot of meat in it.
The seasoning on the Cajun Fries was awesome.  I couldn't eat them fast enough.
The Angry Pig Sandwich was one of the best that I have ever had.  The fried bread that it was one was fantastic.

I'm the child of a father born and raised in Northern Maine and a mother born and raised in New Orleans.

I got the Ray Nagin and a Thai tea shake. The sandwich is turkey, slaw and cheese all grilled to perfection on rye bread. Their bread is the star because it was warm and crisp on the outside and then soft and fluffy on the inside. The sandwich itself was good with a good amount of flavor and crunch from the slaw. Being a novice, I did not know about how to condiment my sandwich but they offer hot sauce and other add ons to make the sandwich sing to your flavor profiles. 

The Thai tea shake was okay. The tea flavor was too subtle for my taste and the texture was a little grainy. That being said, I will definitely come back and try them again and scope out those gravy fries! In terms of pros and cons... Pro: off street parking... Con: located off the busy part of Forest Ave. Pro: sandwiches are fairly priced ranging from $6-12 depending on type and size. Regular is a decent size and the fillings are ample! Con: shake was a bit pricy considering what I got. 4.95 for small and I think large was 6.95.

I had all but stopped ordering sweet potato fries as they have become ubiquitous and uniformly tasteless until I happened to grab one from a friend's order at Po' Boys.  There is something about their oil, or maybe fry time, maybe it's the way they cut them, or maybe the kind of potato they use??

The sandwich, on a baguette, was six or seven inches long and packed with the star ingredient.  I can't imagine how large the large must have been.

Things I love: 

- The food, obviously.  I've probably tried 10% of their menu, and I want to try 95% of it.  Take this as a HUGE compliment because I can't say that about any other menu in town.  Ordering takes me forever because it ALL looks good; this is also unusual because I take a very quick and decisive 'seek and destroy' approach to ordering from menus.  I want to explore all the little sides.  I'm talking to you, red  beans and rice (next time) and gumbo (maybe next time also).   I always make the mistake of throwing on a side to a medium sandwich, and they both together end up being way more than I can tackle.  The basket sides are so big, you guys.  You wouldn't think, at $4/ side.  My only regret is not coming here during dinner, when I can handle a bigger, deep fried meal.  All the menu options feel like dinners wearing a lunch beard.

- I love the New Orleans divey vibe this place has, with music posters, beads dangling from the ceiling, and other odds and ends all over the place that you can examine while you're waiting for your order to come up.  I've spent some time in New Orleans and you actually start getting suspicious if a place with good food ISN'T divey.  I'd rather eat here than in New Orleans any day - they have NOT ONCE asked me to do anything to earn beads, and I have a lesser chance of contracting hepatitis (if you've spent more than 2 minutes on Bourbon Street then you'll understand this).

- I love the location.  It seems like Morrill's corner is experiencing a culinary Renaissance, with Susan's Fish N Chips across the street and a few other good places to eat in the area, too.  Keep it up, Morrill.

It's one of those places that has been on my list forever, that I drive by every single day, but somehow always forgot it as an option when deciding where to eat. 
This Sunday though, I knew I wanted to go to a late brunch somewhere nearby and decided to check if Woodford f&b did brunch- and they sure do! 
From the moment I walked in I was in love. The design is reminiscent of some of my other all time favorite places in Portland (Rose Foods and HiFi donuts) in that it's the perfect mix between vintage and clean, sleek modern elements. I love the booths, giant windows, beautiful wooden ceilings and the white ceramic deer heads (plus the cool golden deer heads at the bar). The environment was so welcoming and truly visually pleasing. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait, really felt like this is a place where locals just stroll in for good quality food and drink without the fuss of going downtown. 

The menu had a brunch prix fixe option for $22, which included bottomless coffee, a cocktail and a brunch entree. We jumped at this option and for the cocktails ended up unanimously choosing the Harvey Wallbanger which was SO good... and slightly dangerous because it tastes more of orange juice than vodka, which meant I had the challenge of remembering to pace myself.
We got the biscuits and sausage gravy, eggs Florentine and the dulce de leche bread pudding French toast. Every single bite of the very generous portion was pure heaven. The biscuits were light, fluffy and absolutely doused with a creamy gravy containing chunks of salty sausage and two sunny side up eggs. Breaking the yolks of those eggs and mixing that in with gravy was incredible. The eggs Florentine was also extremely creamy with a bechamel sauce that married the spinach and poached eggs in a glorious way. When you pair that with the soft focaccia bread that accompanied it- well let's just say there was nothing left to take home. 
To top all of this off was the French toast. Whatever you do, you HAVE to get this. It was both soft and crunchy with toppings like nuts, seeds and raisins that made it feel like it was just as good for your body as it was for your soul. With our food also came a couple bowls of fruit containing pineapple, grapefruit, blood orange and grapes- which added a nice fresh and healthy element to the meal, and made us feel less guilty indulging ourselves. 
My new mission, after having such a wonderful experience, is to become a regular who knows the waitstaff by name and they know mjne. With this being such a cozy neighborhood spot, I don't think I'll have any problems accomplishing this.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

It was my partners birthday dinner and we went early because as a baker bedtime is quite early.
The space looked good, like some kind of futuristic diner.  The tables were clean and the booth we were seated at was comfortable.  Ordered the housemade apple cider and thyme soda - really good.
Dinner  oysters Rockefeller as an ap, the burger for me and steak and fries for the significant other.

The burger.  Not cooked to my requested medium rare but that is the way it goes... always.  Weirdly a bit burnt on the bottom.  The pickles were too much with the grilled onions bacon and cheese.  Too much sweet and vinegar with the char on the bottom.  The fries were crispy and thin... but who can eat two whole potatoes worth in one sitting?  

The other... steak and fries... ordered cooked medium and came out rare.   So tough it was like chewing gum.  I tried some but gave up on swallowing it.  Too bad that plate cost 24$.  At least the were enough fries to make a meal out of that.

All things considered, even if it's a short walk from my apartment I won't be back unless someone else is buying... well... probably not even then.

So, it had been probably at least 6 months since I had been to Woodford F&B. I know the food is great if not a little pricey for the location, but the only thing I can ever remember about the menu is the burger. It's a damn good burger, but it is rich even on the burger spectrum and sometimes I don't want to feel over-full for 3-4 hours. Some errand brought us out this way (okay, maybe the errand was just going to Allagash but I digress), and my girlfriend was pushing hard for a lunch stop at WF&B. We did a drive-by to see there were bar seats open and then utilized the parking over at the Woodfords Club.

It's a Sunday. I'm kind of feeling like I could house that burger and then just lay somewhere all day, or maybe something else equally rich, of which there were a plethora of options. Then some voice that's rarely heard guided me to their cobb salad. A cobb salad typically doesn't generate too much excitement at least if you picture the garden variety (pun not intended), but this one is something else. First awesome thing: Smoked ham AND bacon, along with avocado. You still get the hard boiled egg, tomato, and some scallion and ""young greens"". I could honestly not tell you the difference between young greens and middle-aged greens, but this was a professional salad. An underrated component is when they actually toss the greens in the dressing before adding the rest and serving. Every bite has their buttermilk blue cheese in it, but it's also not overwhelming. Posting a photo, and I think it's one pretty looking salad. 

I guess the point is that we visit WF&B so infrequently that I forgot they can take something as simple as a cobb salad and make it into beautiful and super satisfying meal.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

On a whim I invited my dad out for dinner and there was absolutely no parking at our first choice so having never been here, we both decided to try this place. Yelp has this Mark is three dollar signs for a reason! The cocktail I got was $15 on its own! So if you're going here the idea has to be that you want to treat yourself!

Dad got the mussels and Fries while I got the tri-tip steak and fries. We started by sharing the caramelized onion dip which was divine! It comes with house-made rosemary potato chips and they're certainly more dip than chip. However, having noticed we finished the chips, the waitress offered to have more brought out for free! More chips were brought and the dip was finished I actually use my finger to clean the bowl!

My dad simply loved the mussels and fries going so far as to ask for a second piece of bread to help soak up the liquor at the bottom of the dish before giving it a good Italian slurp! My tri-tip steak and fries we're very respectable. The waitress asked how I would like the steak and I told her medium rare, however the steak ended up medium well. A minor thing and not worth having a fit over, so I simply informed her so that they could know it's something to be aware of. I didn't ask for anything in compensation or a replacement meal, the waitress did offer though.

The unsweetened iced tea my dad had was given a free refill, though I don't know if that's policy or simply our experience. I only had the one cocktail but it was delicious and delightful. In the end I was offered something small on the house as an apology for the steak being inadvertently overcooked. I brought something home for my husband to try since he was babysitting while I was out.

That said, I don't drink alcohol so my options were the usual fare: housemade soda, Maine root soda, coffee, and tea. If you want to know if their alcohol beverage menu is good, you'll have to find a different review!

So let's get down to brass tacks: the food of Woodford Food & Beverage is simply good. I love when a menu is uncomplicated, with choices for all types of eaters but not so overwhelming you drown in the sea of options (a la The Cheesecake Factory). Woodford has options but not too many. It's well prepared and delicious.

Let's start with the Croque Madame! Get it. The béchamel sauce is decadent and there's a whole slice of ham steak in there--no weak deli meat for WF&B. Sunny side egg of perfection added creamy bliss to each bite. Side of herbed dressing covered greens was fine, but nothing overly special.

The burger though. The BURGER. What makes a great burger? Every single damn thing in and on the WF&B' burger. What is that cheese blend?! The brisket and ground beef blend of the beef patty is tender, juicy, and absolute heaven with every mouthful. The bun is awesome. Homemade pickle, fabulous! Each bite of the burger will send you into meat heaven. I have never had such a tender burger and I can't imagine the experience will ever be topped. 

For dessert, we ordered the lemon blueberry panna cotta. The lemon curd was just too overpowering. I mean, I love me some lemon curd in a big way but it masks the perfect vanilla panna cotta beneath. I wish it had been undressed--simple can be better. I would love to try many many of the listed desserts--there were so many delicious options.

First off, the place looks great. There was obviously a lot of attention to the decor and aesthetic of this place. 

I wanted to like this place more though. First off, the coffee was pretty bad. In Portland, that's home to such a great coffee scene, I wish there was more attention to the quality and taste. 

Overall the food was decent, not blown away but very creative dishes and lots of food selection. We ordered some oysters, brussel sprouts, a delicious bread pudding, and other more brunch oriented fare. 

My one gripe of this place was that the eggs Florentine were way over done. The eggs were supposed to be poached and they were served with basically hard boiled yolks. The other eggs were okay and runny as expected.

4912,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4912,2016-01-26,"Woodford's has quickly become quite the hot spot outside of the Old Port. It's a loud, high energy bistro that is a great downtown-ish atmosphere without the hassles. 

It's quite amazing that an attractive upscale bistro opened on such a hectic and wild intersection. There is a small parking lot but it's unclear if it's for the adjacent laundromat or the restaurant. There is ample parking at the Woodford's Club nearby or on side streets. 

The restaurant itself almost feels like a hip diner. The bar was completely full at 5 pm on a Saturday and on a Friday several weeks later. Four top booths line the windows while two tops fill the center of the restaurant. The thick window blinds almost make you forget where you are.

Service was the best aspect of my experience. Our server, who was the twin of Erlich from HBO's Silicon Valley, was exceptional. The menu has a solid variety and has a fixed special of the day. The Quahog Chowder on Thursdays and Braised Lamb Shank on Fridays look the most interesting. The back of the menu is comprised of ten fun cocktails and a variety of beer and wine. It's awesome that the wine is available in three sizes, and the prices are very reasonable.

The prices are not quite as reasonable, however, for the food. The cheeseburger is $16, which may be the highest price in Portland. Again, this a restaurant that is located on one of the worst intersections in the city. Sure, it's an upscale burger made of brisket with bacon and many toppings, but $16??? So, was it worth it? I'll never know, because I ordered it medium rare and it came medium well. The heaping pile of French fries (easily enough for two people) were great. 

The steak and fries ($22) was ordered medium and came well done. It was average, but at least the fries were excellent. The roast half chicken ($21) was well cooked and tasty, but could have used a true side.

I visited on a cold January evening with a friend and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. 

First off - the service was impeccable. I arrived before my friend and checked in with the hostess who went out of her way to make sure that we found each other. 

The space is understated and inviting. As others have said, there is a retro-diner-goes-upscale feel to the design is lovely. My friend and I shared a large booth by the window so we had a great view of the hustle and bustle of the busy intersection where WF&B sits. 

The cocktail list was on the small side, but there were more than enough choices and something tells me that if you sit at the bar, the bartender would be able to whip you up anything your heart desires. I started with a whiskey cocktail with some rosemary and my friend went for a Sex & the City classic - the cosmopolitan. Both were delicious!

I had a long time to study the menu and that's why I'm so disappointed by my order. I was sure I was going to get the lamb special and at the last minute, I went for variety and ordered the beet salad, mussels and frites. They  were all fine - the mussel broth was a little bitter and the beet salad was more of a beet tartar but overall is was perfectly fine. My friend ordered well and I was jealous. She enjoyed her half of the half chicken (they serve a thigh and a breast) and had still had half to take home. The desserts sounded interesting but we opted to go healthy and have tea/coffee instead. 

In all a great experience - I'll order better next time!",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

Came at 5:30pm on a Friday and found out that we should have made a reservation. We sat at the bar and before my cocktail was even made for me a table was ready for us, however. From 5-6pm they have a happy hour at the bar, and I enjoyed a $6 happy hour cocktail which was very good. Typically the cocktails are $8-12. We settled our bar tab and sat at a table. 

The service was very friendly, from the bar staff to the servers. Everyone had a smile and was very polite. We both ordered the steak and fries, medium. The steak was good, not great. I found myself dipping it in the aioli that was for the fries to give it some flavor and moist-ness(?). Fries were great and aioli was great. My friend really enjoyed his, he did ask for BBQ sauce.

4919,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4919,2016-12-02,"I heard a lot of foodie comments about Woodfords. First, there is parking, a small on site lot and an adjacent parking permissible at the Woodford's Club, about 100 yards up the street.

This is the old 80's Valley's steak house. The vibe is dark retro 60's. I personally am not a fan of the decor, although I readily admit, I'm not their target demographic either. I found the atmosphere way to loud and dark for my taste. The menu wasn't readable without my cell phone spotlight. Equally, the server speaking wasn't audible, I couldn't hear a word she said. Again referencing the overall vibe, it's not in my comfort zone....I just didn't enjoy the vibe.

When I first try a restaurant, my choice is to split a few small plates to see if the chef has decent cooking chops and the appetizers match the quality, style, and taste of similar places. I will give it a mixed review here. More negative than positive. 

The deviled eggs, don't smirk, were probably the most distinct and tasteful thing that we ate. Perfectly prepared, with a simple application of ground mustard, bacon, and smoked paprika, they were delicious. At $8....they aren't giving them away, but as a first course, two people get three halves each....and they were on point.

At $30 a dozen, the Damaroscotta oysters were ok....not close to Eventide in side accoutrements or, for my palate, in taste. I'd say they were average...at that price point, I expected better.

The duck mouse pate was decent....the portion was way too excessive for a shared appetizer....cut the price, and the portion size and they would have a better hit here. The pate was creamy, with toasted bread, grain mustard, and gherkins. This was probably the second best thing I sampled....but honestly, nowhere close to a good duck pate from the deli at Rosemont Market. 

Finally, we tried the steak tartare.....liked much more by my GF than I. I found the consistency way too bulky, almost a rough chop on the marinated raw tenderloin. The tartare did have a traditional raw egg yoke on top, that creates that oozing egg yumminess that steak tartare fans love.....This, unfortunately, didn't come anywhere in the ballpark of great local tartare at The Grill Room, or Timber...it just was semi flavorless, and bulky.

So that was our small plate try.....in sum, this is not a fine food establishment. I think if we came in, sat at the bar, had a microbrew and a burger, I'd probably be good with it.....but even there, the vibe and the decor, and overall loudness just isn't my cup of tea.

I'll pass on this spot.....2 1/2 stars.....in my foodie world",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4920,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4920,2018-03-09,"I really want to like WFB.  If I only went in to drink at the bar, I think I'd LOVE it.  Beautiful interior, great location, usually friendly staff.  But time and again, the food has failed me.  WFB falls into this unfortunate middle ground--the food is of a quality that it is more than just pub fare, but is priced as if it's fine dining.  The menu's pricing should be reduced by about a third on all items to make it reasonable for what's being served.

My last experience eating here made it likely I won't return to eat anytime soon.  A group of us were anticipating late dinner.  We made an online reservation for 8:45.  When we arrived at 8:45, we were told (I have to say in a  not altogether friendly way) that the kitchen closed at 9 so we should get our orders in ASAP.  If the kitchen closes at 9, why is making a reservation anytime past 8:15 even an option?  It seems a rookie mistake to not have a reasonable buffer between reservable times and closing time.  We had made the reservation around noon, so it wasn't like we were a walk-in or a surprise.  The food was, as it always is, fine, just fine.  But the staff made us feel as if we were a guilty party, hovering around our table and verbally prompting us to make our choices quickly.  Again, I avoid at all costs being the walk-in ordering food five minutes before the kitchen closes, but if you're accepting my reservation, I expect to be treated like any other earlier customer.
Finally, when our bill came, because we were a party of 7, gratuity was added to our bill.  Usually not a problem to me, except no one told us that gratuity would be added; this was never explicitly stated before we dined.  And frankly, with the staff rushing us and trying to whip us out of the restaurant as fast as possible, the gratuity was higher than I would have liked to leave.

Finally, as noted in previous comments, WFB's water game is on point definitely to a fault.  I do not need someone leaning over my shoulder every four minutes to pick up the water pitcher and pour more into my glass.  Find the happy medium!

Go to WFB, drink, maybe have their fries, which are excellent.  But it's a splurge that I would much rather make at any number of other Portland establishments.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4921,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4921,2017-08-20,"We live in walking distance, and this remains one of our favorite spots in the area. Highly recommended. Came back here twice recently with friends in the past few weeks, and my wife and I wandered in last Saturday before the dinner rush just for cheese and drinks at the bar. Service was, as always, impeccable -- the staff is very friendly, and really makes you feel comfortable. 

The drink selection remains fantastic, and the house-made sodas & shrubs are good enough to get with or without alcohol (even if you're of drinking age). If you can't make up your mind, both the waitstaff and the barstaff are highly knowledgeable and will be able to make good recommendations tailored to your specific tastes.

The food remains excellent, and certainly seems a good value compared with some other Portland-area restaurants. Portions are sized appropriately, not so small that you remain hungry, but not so large that you're overstuffed if you try a few things. Most recently, I had the steak-frites plate -- perfectly prepared strip steak, good seasoned fries (just salt & pepper, maybe some light batter?), and horseradish sauce. There were a few fries left, but not enough to pack up. On the other hand, my wife had the roast chicken and took at least half of hers home at the end of the night. Both were preceded by the mushroom tartine and the brussel sprouts (split four ways, between us and our friends) and all four of us were too full for dessert by the end.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "
4922,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4922,2016-09-21,"I really did like Woodford when they first opened, but... I don't know anymore. I'm not sure that it's become/is becoming the go-to neighborhood spot everyone had touted it would be (speaking as someone who can actually walk here). Now that its had time to settle in and go through a local's season to tourist season back to a local's season, I'm just not as besotted as I initially thought I was.

What I still love:
+ The cocktails. Competitive prices for Portland standards and they're really, really well crafted. From speciality drinks to simple martinis, every cocktails I've tried from here has been delicious, refreshing, balanced, and worth it. 
+ The space. I had originally described it as having a ""monochromatic-1950's diner-sans kitsch-stark without being sterile-feel"", which was cool and different for Portland. I still dig it. 

What I'm no so sure of anymore:
- The food. Small portions, big prices, and it's all just okay. It seems they run out things quickly, and the vegetarian options are uninspired and unmemorable. Again maybe this is just one of those awesome places in town that's much better for people without dietary restrictions, so maybe just ignore me (I won't be offended!) and go eat the burger here - I've heard it's the best in the city!
- The service. It's not bad, it's just... all over the place. At our latest trip here, while we had our water glasses refilled probably close to twenty times (no joke), the various people coming to our tables and relaying information to one another caused errors in our orders. We were wholly forgotten about at one point (minus the swooping in to fill our water glasses without a word) and then made to feel bad when we wanted to order food. And - despite asking for a specific kind of vodka for my martini - they decided to make all the martinis at the table with the same kind and charge us all the same price. That's not cool, is it? 

I think this is one of those places that's got two personalities: the one at the bar is much different then the one on the floor.

First, the bartenders are the absolute best - friendly, fun, knowledgeable, and talented. I'm always happy with their cocktails and their recommendations of which wine(s) to try. I'm still dreaming about the mojito I had a few weeks ago. Also, it's a bonus that you can get carafes/ half carafes of wine. They have a small, but good selection of beers.

Next, the food. My goodness.

Mussels [& fries]: The best I've ever had. The mussels, which on all 3 occasions I've had them, hailed from Calendar Island in Casco Bay. The broth is amazing - not overly buttery or fancy. To me, when it comes to seafood, simplicity is always best and Woodford F&B certainly delivers! On one occasion, I saw two women using the mussel shells to scoop up the remaining broth. While you could go that route, I would just get some extra bread!

Pate - It's always different. We've tried salmon, chicken, and duck. The salmon was by far my favorite, but they were all great! In fact, one of my friends who swore she didn't like duck and pate - was scooping up the last bites.

Caramelized Onion Dip / Deep Fried Brussel Sprouts - YUM. 

The Burger - Yes, it is a $16 burger. To me, it was very worth it. The brisket just melted in my mouth! Normally, I would be pretty upset with the soggy bun, but I'm pretty sure that's because I let it sit on my plate for a few minutes (too busy chatting).  It also comes with a TON of french fries.

Desserts - The strawberry rhubarb dessert with ice cream is just perfect in my book.

Woodford F&B has struck gold!  In an ex-car-dealership, in a somewhat drab and busy corner, is a gem.  The menu is impressive and dynamic, with both well-known and eccentric flavors.  The burger is the best burger I've ever had, period.  Ever.  And the fries are haunting my dreams.  I had pickled veggies, including tomatoes, as a complimentary appetizer.  So good!  Plus a great wine pour, which is always a bonus.

Also amazing is how you can go get oysters, foie gras, tuna nicoise, and steak tartar one night, but burgers and fries another.  Everything I've had here has been exceptional.  

And finally, it's a great restaurant off the peninsula.  I know there are others, but they're few and far between.  I don't have to drive all the way downtown to get some exceptional food, and for that I'm SO thankful.

The meat was just OK, but basically the equivalent of my SAT scores: dead average. 

The music was nice (I like to see a hostess gettin her groove on), and I give it to the service; everyone is friendly. Yet, I think the highlight for our dining experience was making sure that we finished our bottle of wine.

First, I regret not writing this review a couple of months ago when I visited.  I had remembered, however, to jot down the name and what I ate in my iPhone notes.  We had ordered the filet mignon which was being featured that evening.  The server, about 10 minutes later came back out to the table and apologized that they had run out of it.  She suggested the tri-tip to be served similarly and I thought that sounded like a great idea.  Unfortunately, it was so totally chewy and raw it was barely edible.  My husband and I were having such a good time and the staff was just so nice - I didn't have the heart to say anything which I regret.  Please, do not substitute tri-tip for filet.  I mean, everyone knows they are two totally different cuts of meat but don't promote it as great.  Tri tip, in order for it to be tender must not be served rare because it is chewy and tough.  It was kind of ridiculous the way it was fanned out on the plate and then inedible.  I promise to upgrade my review next time but wanted to make sure the management is aware of this problem.

The wait staff is also engaging, helpful, and down-to-earth.

The first few times I came here I was a bit skeptical because, in terms of food, the vegetarian options are pretty meager.  The one vegetarian entrée is called ""vegetables and grains,"" which is possibly the blandest name of a dish I have ever come across at a restaurant.  Nevertheless, it's tastier than I expected.  They also have really good shoe-string french fries that rank up there with the best in Portland.

In lieu of dinner, however, I recommend coming here for cocktails and dessert.  They may have my favorite cocktails in town.  They're tasty, well-balanced, and elegantly presented.  I also found their desserts to be sweet and delicious.

Their sound track had some CCR, so obviously this place is rad just from that fact alone.  

  Tar Tar was a hefty portion, even more so for a ""small"" portion.  Little on the peppery side, but still enjoyable.  Bread it came with was a great vessel to transport to my feeding hole.  Mussels were large, tasty and cooked in a lovely sauce.  The fries the mussels came with, holy molly, those things are dang good!  

Flounder was lovely, perfectly cooked served on a bed of rice, with a veggie and delicious sauce.  The burger, well reminded me of a Burger King rodeo burger... in an EPIC way.   Cooked a lovely medium, the thing gets a big thumbs up from me.  

Complementary cookies, well I wouldn't be pleased if I had to pay for them.  I wouldn't say they sucked, but in comparison to all the other lovely things I placed in my gut that evening, the cookies weren't great at all.

The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  

This 1970's style diner features an eclectic selection of dishes prepared with an earthy Mediterranean flare.  We started out with the beet salad and the savory duck pate.  Then the four of us each chose a different entree.  Dad enjoyed his burger, which has received many raves.  Mom's maple glazed pork chop was excellent, thick and juicy, with a smoky wood-grilled flavor.  I loved the creamy yogurt sauce and the sumac dry rub on my roast chicken.

We have only two complaints.  My husband's quahog chowder was pretty paltry for seventeen bucks.  A half-dozen clams were arranged in a puddle of thin broth along with some cubed potatoes.  This was supposed to be an entree.  It wasn't.

The other problem with this charming place is the noise.  The cheerful chatter mixes with the music from the bar and bounces off the high ceiling, making it almost impossible to converse.  Perhaps some carpeting would help?

Despite these two little glitches, I'm grateful to Woodford F & B for being an oasis of taste and civility amid the craziness of Portland on a Saturday night.

The fries that come with it are really good too! Not my favorite fries, they are a little bit too thin maybe, and with the outside crust emphasized a bit too much for my taste. But they are covered in a fantastic Chinese five spicy kinda seasoning that more than makes up for their shortcomings. Also you get about 10,000 of them on the plate. The fries also come with the steak frites which is exactly the dependable classic that you want it to be. 

Which is pretty much the story at Woodford in general.There aren't any big surprises, it's got a classic, timeless French brasserie kinda vibe, that managers to still feel fresh and contemporary. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the Sunday night special, Croque Madame. Once again, it plays it totally by the book and delivers. And it come with a nice big salad.

The service was on point, our waitress was attentive, knew the specials, and was able to answer our questions about the menu items. Additionally, other waitstaff stopped at our table a couple of times to ask if we needed anything. As a matter of fact, all of the Woodford staff were extremely hospitable and gracious.

The Food:

We had the deep-fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer, the leaves having mostly separated from the heads, arrived with the texture of the charred pages of a novel.  While they retained a pleasant flavor and the accompanying sauce was complimentary, the airy consistency made for an awkward dance on the palate. Both Tiqa and Boda excel in their preparation of this trendy micro- cabbage, Woodford should take note.  I should mention that the portion is sizable, and despite the awkward dance, we finished them.

I had the whole grain risotto, it was the best I have ever tasted.  It was full of grains, wheat berries, farro etc., and mascarpone, it was as moist and creamy as anything I have ever put in my mouth.  Cooked to perfection.

He had the braised lamb shank special.  It was meaty and delicious, and it took everything he had to not pick up the bone to gnaw at the remaining juicy slivers of stringy sinew.  

We also shared a crusty apple crisp-ish dessert with ice cream.  It, too, was delicious.  The dessert to ice cream ratio was spot on, and, again, the overall portion size was, well, it was HUGE, and that's not something I say often.

We liked the atmosphere, the floor to ceiling ceramic tile, the diner tables, and the not quite finished floor...totally felt like a neighborhood joint, no pretension, just great food at reasonable prices.",4.0,3,"['660 Forest Ave', 'Portland, ME 04103']",43.6709338673948,-70.2845136073474,"American (New), Seafood, Bars, "

Creative cocktail menu, curated beer and wine selection, and daily drink specials.  The menu is creative, but I wish there were a few more dishes.  The weekly specials looked great, but only salmon was available the day I came; not my favorite.  I would have loved to try the skate wing (or any other day's special), but to no avail.  Maybe next time.  Also, every dish seems to have an ""aioli.""  Perhaps the chef needs to scrap that idea, and focus on creating lighter, more modern sauce versions (just a suggestion).  Brussels sprouts as a starter were incredible, with a crisp smoky flavor we loved.  Cheese selection (of one) was tasty, but it was only one cheese; would prefer three smaller portions instead of just one.  For Main courses, we had the salmon special (simply prepared, for my son), the steak frites, and the pork chop.  Salmon was undercooked; I'm not a fan of the ""rare"" salmon.  Should be cooked fully or almost fully.  Not to our liking.  Pork Chop was the table hit; thick, juicy and spiced just right.  Steak frites was also above average; medium rare sliced steak over a horseradish cream.  Fries were crispy and tasty.  Service was professional if a bit too stiff.

I'll wait for the next owner before going back. The space is very nice, but they come off as a bunch of kids on trust funds that think they can throw anything on a place and charge $25.00 for it.

4963,2g6SV6WryD7mwo2vgRNbiQ,woodford-f-&-b,4963,2017-07-09,"The fries.  Wow.  Great fries. 

They start with the pre-coated,  frozen variety, which tend to crisp up better than fresh cut, twice- cooked, raw potato version. And it is that crispness, plus their proprietary seasoning,  and the perfect  aioli that make these the tastiest fries I've ever eaten - period. The fries alone make this place worth a visit. 

The rest of the menu is an eclectic mix of classic bistro fare and comfort food with a few American staples mixed in. The entree menu is abbreviated (2 beef, 1 pork, 1 fish, 1 chicken, 1 veggie entree).  A broader selection of appetizers, some salads, and a burger round out the menu, with a list of daily specials adding diversity. There is an adventurous cocktail, wine and craft beer menu with something for all palates, and a kids menu too - often a plus for us. 

The building is a converted space, a former Valle's steakhouse. And while the tables and settings were neat and clean, the hard floor to ceiling surfaces made for somewhat noisy environs.  The plain walls and decor lacked visual interest, offset by a few retro architectural details like the pitched bead-board ceiling.  Hand written signs on office paper taped to doors & windows are an eyesore, belying quality elsewhere.   An interior designer could easily spruce up some of these defects pretty easily. 

Service was friendly, knowledgeable, prompt and attentive, but uneven at times. No major flaws, just a bit choppy in communication and execution.

I've been saying since I moved here 4 months ago 'I really wanna try that place, it looks cool.' I've followed them on instagram and have drooled over the pictures. WTF took me so long?! Well NYE I finally gave this place a go. Holy shit guys. This place is NOT playing around. From the atmosphere to the music and the lighting you automatically feel like ' hey, this is a cool place.' Doesn't feel too 'hipster' nor too 'expensive' . It kinda encompasses the laid back and cool style of Portland. The service is OUT OF THIS WORLD. You can always tell something about a business and the owner by the attitude of the staff. Everyone was super fucking nice and chill. Our waitress was fantastic. I wish I remembered her name but seriously this woman was awesome! We ordered the Oysters from Damariscotta . If eating oysters was like having sex then I definitely orgasmed like 4 times. So fresh and so tasty! My Boo got the Tennessee ham. He is from Tennessee and it made me happy when he said ' this reminds me of what my papaw used to cook'. It was beyond cool that the dish took him back in time. But that's how awesome this place is. Our waitress told us that the owner is a freak about researching ham and is determined the find the best. This kinda passion definitely shines through in the restaurant. 
For the main dish I got the Casio Bay Flounder and OMG. I can confidently say it was the BEST dish I have ever had. So perfectly cooked and put together. Every single bit was melting in my mouth. I was in disbelief each time I took a bite. My Boo got the steak and fries and he was thoroughly enjoying the meal as well, however he wanted mine more once he got a bite. 
I can't say enough good things about this place. It's awesome. I love that it's not downtown too. Its like a little gem outside the city.

I'd personally give the food a 3/5, based on what we ordered, which was the Burger, Croque Madame (w/o the egg), and mussels. I had the mussels. The Burger (which is the menu name) was AMAZING - soft, juicy, and flavorful. However, it was a grease trap and sent oil running down my brother's hands when he ate it. The Croque Madame has excellent sauce and garnishing, and the cheesy topping was delicious. The meat, a slice of ham, wasn't as impressive, but overall decent meal. Lastly, I would not recommend the mussels. They were worse than the ones you can buy at the store and boil for half the price. I'd say they were severely underseasoned.

To start with, these guys have some of the best cocktails in town hands down. I arrived close to closing time, but the bartender (Miranda) was very friendly and talkative. I ordered the pork chop, but unfortunately there seemed to be a communication breakdown in the kitchen and it took over 20 minutes for them to prepare it even though there was hardly anybody else in the restaurant. A man who I later realized was either the manager or the owner brought my meal to me and apologized for the wait, but when I cut into it I could see that it was not cooked all the way through. Miranda took it away without a second question and apologized, saying she would comp my drink. At that point I ordered a second cocktail  and tried to be patient, but the second try took the kitchen almost 15 minutes, so at that point I was getting pretty impatient and probably visibly irritated. Again, the owner/manager dude brought my plate out and apologized wholeheartedly. As I ate my meal I couldn't deny that it was delicious, and when I finally asked for the check Miranda had taken about $30 off my bill. I was blown away, and instantly the frustration from the long wait disappeared. To make it even better, the owner/manager dude then came over with a bottle of Fernet and we took shots together. I have worked many years in the restaurant industry and I can't remember a time when a manager has shown such a genuine interest in making up for a kitchen staff's mistake, which happens from time to time no matter how nice the restaurant might be.

This place has it all - great food, amazing community oriented vibe, awesome interior, owners that are ready and willing to put in the labor and the love to grow an awesome locals spot.... and it's hopefully the anchor for the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  So, to elaborate on each of those topics... 
Food - I had the daily fish.  It was pollock the night I went - not always a fish I gravitate to because I feel like it's easy to overcook - no such trouble at WFB.  It was perfectly cooked on a bed of greens and wheat berries.  The deep-fried brussels sprouts were addictively crispy/savory.  Husband had the chicken... comfort food at its finest.  And a good kid's menu to boot.  Friends at a nearby table were raving about the burger and mussels and fries.  The menu features a handful of favorites, and a ""plat du jour"" section.  The theme seems to be a combination of rich comfort food, super well executed pub classics, and a smattering of ingenious and unexpected details.
Vibe - Well, we showed up at 5 cause that's when our kids get hungry... the place was full within 45 minutes of good-restaurant-starved Deering Center peeps.  Seriously, everyone I know in the neighborhood has been saying, for years, that we need a restaurant with great food and a great vibe to be the gathering spot.  This is it.  
Interior - Husband and I both remarked on how cool the windows and blinds were.  To be honest, blinds are not something I would normally notice, let alone comment on.  But these things somehow transformed the ridiculous Forest Ave snarl of headlights into.... mood lighting.  We also loved the diner style booth seating.
Owners - one of the owners, Birch, came by and said introduced himself.  It's clear this is a labor of love and he and his wife are in it for the long haul.  They're invested in this neighborhood and we couldn't be happier to have them.
 So, mark my words, this is more than a new restaurant... it's a spot for the neighborhood to gather at... it's the beginning of the renewal of Woodford's Corner.  But the food and vibe is good enough to draw you guys from the peninsula.  Don't worry, there's parking for you at the Woodford's Club.

Both were disgusting. I had what I can only describe as mushroom and eggplant bruschetta which had the consistency of rubber and was borderline unpalatable. I don't often say that food is bad or gross, I might say ""okay"" or ""not very good,"" but this was seriously unpleasant to eat. My friend had some sort of tuna and avocado tartar which was essentially flavorless. On top of a disappointing meal the bill was outrageous: two beers and two small appetizers totaled $45!

The lobster salad is also a good option, and I'm a fan of the clams.",3.5,2,"['5 Portland Pier', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65601400742022,-70.2511765232788,"Seafood, "

Pros: J's has a great selection of fresh seafood. The lobster roll was one of the best I've had--the lobster was very flavorful and fresh. It came with mayonnaise but I only used butter because that's really all you needed. My husband had the crabby Janice and also loved it. While we didn't get oysters, they seem to be the most popular dish and everyone around us appeared to be enjoying them. They also have a full bar and some non seafood menu items (although not sure why you would want that). The atmosphere is sort of local/homey and a lot of people there seemed to be regulars.

Cons: The clam chowder we had was a little bland. In addition, we went on a cold day and since it's on the water it was a little chilly inside and hard to get comfortable. Also doesn't have the easiest parking, we ended up paying $12 for a lot next door so be careful where you park if you have a choice. 

Bottom line: Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area, especially for the lobster roll.",3.5,2,"['5 Portland Pier', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65601400742022,-70.2511765232788,"Seafood, "

When in Maine, eat where the locals eat. My friend and her husband wanted to take us to their favorite oyster bar for dinner. She swears it's the best oyster bar she's been to since moving to Portland a couple years ago. 

Nicknamed ""the pearl of the waterfront"", J's Oyster has been a local favorite since 1977, so we were really looking forward to having a great meal on our first night in Portland. 
http://bit.ly/2PDmJDY

When we got there a little after 7pm, both the indoor and outdoor dining areas were packed solid. Luckily we didn't have to wait longer than 20+ minutes as many of the outdoor diners were already finishing up and paying their bills. We chose to sit outdoors because the set-up inside was so divey, humid and musty. There was a huge u-shaped bar that took up majority of the dining area, so trying to navigate through the restaurant to get to the restroom was tricky because you'll end either up bumping up against the seated diners or crashing into a servers if you're not careful.

Our server was nice enough but wasn't able to tell us which particular oyster types from Maine or Virginia was avail for the night. From what I've read up on before my trip, Maine has about 6-8 different harvesters/suppliers that farms oysters with different tastes and characteristics....oh well.
The food and stiff drinks arrived fairly quickly, so that was a plus. I have to agree with my friend about the oysters and crab legs being good, but everything else was rather underwhelming.  

MAINE OYSTERS ($28/dozen, we ordered 2 dozen): 
http://bit.ly/2yR9LsO
It was a little meatier than the Virginia oysters but I didn't find it be briny enough. Very very subtle, almost tasted like it was kept in fresh water or submerged in melted ice for too long.

VIRGINIA OYSTERS ($23/dozen, we ordered 2 dozen):
http://bit.ly/2D32Cbq
http://bit.ly/2DoXD6f
My favorite out of the 2. Smaller bivalves that tasted crisp and briney. I was able to enjoy as is without any cocktail sauce. 

ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS DINNER served with steamed clams and corn on the cob ($26 marketprice):
http://bit.ly/2PesMzl
My friend's husband totally wiped out this dish. He said the crab was good but the portions were too small for his appetite so he was still hungry. 

MAINE RED HOT DOG served with a pickle spear and chips ($5.50):
http://bit.ly/2D6mevF
I ordered 1 hot dog each for both myself and my friend's husband towards the end of our meal because we were both still hungry, lol.
When it arrived, I laugh out loud because it looked exactly like Hawaii's Redondo's red beef&pork hot dogs. It tasted like it too.
- I finished mines because I was hungry, but my friend's husband took only one bite and never picked it back up.  

PAN-STEAMED MUSSELS ($13.50): 
http://bit.ly/2DlYBzU
This was a hit with everyone at our table. Everything from the perfectly-cooked mussels to the garlicky savory sauce laced with butter and chilies was delightful. The toasted soft buns was great for sopping up all that wonderful garlic broth at the bottom of the bowl. 

OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER ($11 FOR 3):
http://bit.ly/2JENsKQ
Cheesy garlicky spinach on top of oyster shells. There was very little oysters in this dish. I wasn't able to find any oysters in mine at all.

BAKED STUFFED OYSTERS ($11 FOR 3):
http://bit.ly/2SLR1mD
Same issue as the oysters rockefeller, not much oysters and lobster. Menu said ""3 oysters with a lobster stuffing"" but all I got from it was mounds of really dry breadcrumbs and bacon. Thank goodness for beers and vodka to wash it all down. 

STEAMED CLAMS ($12.50 sm, $17.50 med & $22.50 lg):
http://bit.ly/2FcYZCO
I was really looking forward this bucket of bivalves. The medium bucket we ordered came with a generous amount of steamer clams, butter for dipping and a 2 bowls of broth.
- FYI, the broth is NOT FOR CONSUMPTION per our server. 
You're supposed to ""wash"" your clam meat by swishing it back and forth in the broth to remove all the sand and grits after you shell them before eating.
- Such a shame because although the clams were meaty & tasty, it was hard to get passed all that grit every time you chew. The rinsing instructions given to us didn't help, there was still a lot of crunchy grit left. Not a very enjoyable way to eat clams.

Hey at least the oysters and mussels were good =)

5240,FZXIMypSxktqxf62OZGVFQ,j's-oyster,5240,2019-02-02,"Ok so this was the first place I visited for dinner when visiting Portland, Maine for my first time and I was not disappointed! My girlfriend and I couldn't wait to get our hands on some fresh seafood enjoyed by the locals, and my godmother (a local) raves about this place and treated us here.

We parked down the street from the parking lot (free parking) as the parking lot for the establishment was packed. It is right on the harbor with a beautiful view of fishing boats and waterfront. It is a smaller restaurant that is by no means fancy. Its got a hole-in-the-wall feel, which is what I love, and I already knew the food was going to be incredible. 

Upon walking inside we were instantly greeted with a warm smile and welcome, and were told that there was no seating available at the moment but were more than welcome to sit at the bar to eat. This place was packed and we visited in December (completely out of season), and late at night! Filled with locals and fishermen. My girlfriend and I ordered some Allagash beer served in a chalice. I fell in love with this beer and miss it now that I'm back here in south Florida. 

We then received our table and were greeted by our waitress. We ordered a medium bucket of steamers ($17.50), crab stuffed mushrooms ($12.50), and clam chowder ($7.50). The steamers were good, but a little too overcooked. They are served with broth on the side to clean each clam but no matter how much I seemed to ""de-sand"" the clams I always bit into sand which was a bit of a turn off for me. but they were still pretty good! The mushrooms were delicious! We found ourselves picking ever morsel of cheese and stuffing out of the dish because they were so good! The clam chowder was the star of the star of the show for the appetizers. I don't know if it was because I have never had authentic clam chowder from New England before or what but WOW! Loaded with clams, with so much flavor. Not to thick and creamy, yet not watery. Perfect consistency. Served with those oyster crackers, simply perfect chowder.

For our entrees, we ordered the seafood casserole ($28), lobster scampi ($26.50), and scallops with lemon and dill pasta ($25). I ordered the lobster scampi, and was blown away. The dish was so simple yet so delicious. generous portions of lobster in a garlic butter wine sauce on angel hair. SO GOOD! My girlfriend got the scallops. 5 jumbo sized scallops over a creamy lemon dill sauce with angel hair. Once again, so simple yet perfect dish. Scallops were fresh, juicy and perfectly cooked. My godmother ordered the seafood casserole consisting of lobster, shrimp, scallops, crab and other delicious stuff topped and topped with breadcrumbs. It was very good from what I tried and very generous portions of seafood but a little bit to much stuffing and breadcrumbs for me. However it was a great dish, just personal preference.

I will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Maine. Great homemade food with fresh caught seafood. Friendly and attentive staff that treats you like family. A real locals' spot. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu!",3.5,2,"['5 Portland Pier', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65601400742022,-70.2511765232788,"Seafood, "
5241,FZXIMypSxktqxf62OZGVFQ,j's-oyster,5241,2018-09-12,"I had one of my favorite Portland meals right here at J's Oyster: steamers, or Maine soft shell steamed clams. Damn, these were so, so good.

Essentially, you get a bucket of steamers, along with a bowl of the clam broth that they've been cooked with, plus some melted butter. Open the shell of a steamer, take out the clam, pinch and remove the outer ""skin,"" swish the clam in the broth to remove the sand (while maintaining the flavor), dip it in butter, then take a bite and transport yourself to heaven. J's steamers are so juicy and flavorful all on their own. When you have quality seafood you don't need much else than butter, if that.

You can also get a lobster dinner for $32, which comes with a whole steamed lobster, about a dozen steamers, and an ear of corn. The corn isn't the juiciest, but it's still nice and sweet. The lobster is also perfectly cooked, and aside from that you can't really mess up lobster. And the steamers... well, I think I've covered that in depth.

The four stars are due to a few missteps with our other dishes. My Maine oysters were a bit sloppily shucked and the sizes were inconsistent, with some being pretty deflated-looking and sad. The Cajun scallop roll was over seasoned and salty, so much so that the scallop flavor was lost. The dish was also loaded with potato chips, which I'm not a big fan of, but that's more of a personal thing. My friend got the Crabby Janice (crab casserole topped with bread crumbs and mornay sauce) and it was really, really rich and heavy. Not too shabby as a shared appetizer or something, but as a whole entree it was too much to take.

But those steamers... Sigh. I want to go back. We heard from several of our rideshare drivers that J's is the place where locals go, and I understand why.",3.5,2,"['5 Portland Pier', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65601400742022,-70.2511765232788,"Seafood, "
5242,FZXIMypSxktqxf62OZGVFQ,j's-oyster,5242,2019-01-03,"As you approach J's it looks like your standard dive seafood restaurant near the water. It has a small, free parking lot that is frequently full with roaming cars looking for a spot. This is because the meters charge a ludicrous $10/hr charge. Just some additional information and logistics here before we get to the bulk of the review. 

Now, as you approach the building it is nothing special, a basic building that has a bar that takes up about 2/3 of the total seating space. If you don't have a reservation (or are very lucky like us), you will likely be grabbing a beer or drink from here or dining here if you are alone or with another guest (tables for 2 are hard to come by at peak times). The place will be full with regulars, local fishermen and workers, as well as airline personnel and tourists... you can even spot business-people here during the lunch hour as everyone has come to love J's or are brought here by the lore that comes with its reputation. The decor screams ""beach town"" in the campy, vacation kinda way with the bar seeming like a dark-wooded version that you would see in a fishing town drama movie or TV show. It kind of adds to the whole experience of the meal in my opinion, setting you up to really feel like you are living and eating like the local dockworkers and fishermen do, even if it is just for an hour or so. 

We shared a bowl of the clam chowder (think smooth, creamy, briny perfection), a med bucket of clams (eating demo included), and the lobster roll (a little butter on the grilled bun, a little mayo, and a TON of lobster). Full disclosure here and allow me to put low ratings' complaints to bed... this is NOT FANCY FOOD. What it lacks in presentation and over the top methodologies of prep it delivers in the highest quality seafood using traditional recipes you will find in New England. Everything is treated as it should be and allows the freshness and briny flavors of the sea to come through and be the star of the meal. The ""ocean meats"" as my wife and I have come to call them were treated with the Midas Touch and had the perfect level of heat applied without creating a rubbery mess that gets stuck all through your teeth or tastes like a bad fish market smells. If you're not familiar with the type of clams they sell, they even give you a demonstration of how to properly eat them and not get seawater all over yourself in the process, which was appreciated if not a bit funny after they watched me struggle to figure out what to do with a 2-3# bucket of clams that I had never seen before. 

The prices are more than reasonable which I think add to the lore of this place. The servers are friendly and while they may not be the most prompt individuals it is because the whole restaurant is a madhouse of people for most of the time it is open. While that is not necessarily an excuse or ""out"" for the slower service... the whole vibe is a little more laid back and I'm 100% fine with that as long as I'm not trying to get in and out in less than an hour on a working lunch. 

If you are looking for something fancy, this is not the place for you. However, if you are looking for some of the finest seafood treated in the manner it should be and don't mind sitting back and relaxing a bit to be served, then I assure you that disappointment shall not cross your lips at J's.",3.5,2,"['5 Portland Pier', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.65601400742022,-70.2511765232788,"Seafood, "

lobster dinner comes with steamers on the plate + corn (we were substituted with cole slaw) The lobster meat was so sweet and juicy, and was a solid reminder why lobster is the most famous product of maine to the out of state visitors. Steamers were delicious as well - even though you had to work to remove the skin and rinse, it was well worth it.

Lobster roll wasn't the best as the bread that was served was very crusty. Most of the bites tasted of bread and butter, and you would get hints of lobster throughout.

5272,FZXIMypSxktqxf62OZGVFQ,j's-oyster,5272,2017-08-16,"This is the reason you visit Maine, for a nice hearty lobster meal, and J's Oyster was one of the best lobster meals my fiance and I ever had!

There were a ton of restaurants that served lobster in Portland, to no one's surprise, and seemingly they were all very similar according to the online reviews. However, what drew us to J's were the positive reviews about the quality of their food and the fact it was truly a restaurant first. 

My fiance and I dropped in for dinner at around 6:15pm on a recent Saturday evening and waited for about 40 minutes for a table, which wasn't that bad. There was the choice of either eating indoors or in their small outdoor area. We chose indoors because it was a bit chilly/windy outside. The indoor dining space was tight and dim. The bar was smack dab in the middle of the room and tables aligned the walls, but all of the tables seated at least 4 so there was plenty of space for the 2 of us.

We already knew what we wanted, which was the lobster entree, but we decided to take it a step further and go all out by ordering multiple appetizers. And go all out we did, as even the waitress was taken aback by how many dishes we ordered! Here's the rundown:

NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER - A bit too watered down for our liking. There was plenty of potatoes and clams inside, but the chowder was not thick enough.

LOBSTER STEW - Same issue as the chowder as the stew was very thin and a bit watered down. It could have used more thickening. However, we were surprised at how much lobster meat was inside, which we really appreciated and was fine by us!

OYSTER SAMPLER (Raw, Baked, Stuffed, Rockefeller, and Mornay) - Unfortunately, there was only 1 oyster of each, but every single one was delicious. Actually, our waitress saw that there was 2 of us, so she gave us an extra raw oyster, which was super nice of her. All of the oysters were fantastic and the cooked ones were perfectly done.

COMBO SEAFOOD COCKTAIL (Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Raw Scallops, and Raw Oysters) - All of the seafood was so fresh and really to die for. It was everything we wanted wrapped up in one appetizer dish. It definitely wet our appetite and set us up for what was to come.

LOBSTER ROLL - Other than the chowder and stew, maybe the other disappointment of the night. Disappointment might be a strong word though as the lobster meat was refreshing and the bun was toasted to perfection with butter, but it was basically just lobster meat on a toasted bun. No extra seasoning or mayo mixed in. In fact, there was a packet of Hellman's mayo on the plate for customers who wanted to smother some on their lobster. We preferred if the lobster was seasoned and mayo'd up for us. Also, included in the dish were a pickle and some ruffle chips. This is probably the one dish I wouldn't recommend if you go with the lobster dinner.

LOBSTER DINNER (1 1/8 lb lobster) served with steamed clams and corn on the cob - Yes, yes, yes! The plate was as glorious as we had imagined. A huge lobster sitting on a plate of steamed clams and corn on the cob. The lobster was amazingly fresh, as though it had just been caught out of the bay. Every time we cracked a piece of our lobsters, hot water just spilled out oozing of lobster flavor. It was full of meat every which way and perfect. 

On the other hand, the clams needed cleaning. Although they were steamed very well, there was a lot of sand in them and each piece absolutely needed cleaning inside the bowl of water provided on the plate. The corn was OK, nothing to write home about.

We were 100% satisfied with coming to J's Oyster over the competition. It was everything we wanted out of a meal in Portland. There were some hiccups, such as the chowder, stew, lobster roll and steamed clams, but the lobster was what we were here for and it delivered big time. In addition, our waitress was fantastic. She was flying all over the place and apologized that we received our chowder and stew late, but she explained why. We also had a small conversation after our meal about our origins.

Js doesn't have any grand decor. In fact, it really can use a makeover inside and furniture upgrade. However, service was really good. Very happy and bright people. 

I ordered the lobster stew, lobster roll, and haddock sandwich. I skipped the steamer since I saw reviews talking about the steamers having sand in it. Really not a fan of sandy shellfish. The lobster roll is not bad although I've had better. You do get claw meat and not mixed and shredded meat. The lobster stew was a let down for me. I guess I wasn't expecting the taste of alcohol in it. I wish I tried the clam chowder instead. The lobster stew is pricey too at $12.5 a cup versus $7 for clam chowder. The highlight for me was the haddock sandwich. I almost missed this on the menu. Not until I was ordering that I saw it. The waitress immediately said that the haddock sandwich is her favorite. The fish filet was breaded and fried just right. The batter wasn't too thick and wasn't soggy at all. The fish was moist and with just a schmear of tartar sauce, the sandwich is just perfect.

Ordered half a dozen oyster, cup of clam chowder, large bucket of clams and side of potato salad.

The oysters were big and delicious. Super tasty!!! Highly recommend.

The clam chowder was full of flavor, but too liquidy for me. If it was just a bit more thick, it would have been perfect but it was like watery soup then a chowder. 

The large clams for 2 of us was a bit too much for us to finish. Lol, but it was great. Couldn't really taste the butter so I asked for lemon on the side and dipped it with that.

Potato salad was bland so add salt and pepper and it'll be super refreshing. The hint of scallion slices in there was yummy.

This one is a difficult 4.5 for me because of the price. Individual oysters are $2.50, or 6 for $15 and a dozen for $29. I believe this is the same as Eventide and Central Provisions, which in my book are pricey places. If I didn't know about The Shop (oyster joint on Washington Ave where oysters are $1.50/each or $18/dozen), it wouldn't have occurred to me that cheaper is possible. But back to the things to love about Maine Oyster Co!:

-walked in a little before 5pm on Saturday and were the first ones here. SUPER friendly service - the guys behind the counter were eager to explain the menu and the really cool map on their wall displaying the origin of the current selection.
-we were difficult and asked if we could do the dozen, but start with 2 of each and then pick our favorite and get one more each of those to total a dozen (since 5 varieties were on offer), and they were more than happy to oblige!
-prosecco on tap! (I'm loving this trend)
-they gave us their special on the house!! (Oyster with spicy sauce and a shot of prosecco), very generous of them, I think bc it was would our first time here.
-LOVED the cozy, warm wooden nautical interior with light strung everywhere.

They do have more non-oyster food on offer here than The Shop, but the Shop has significantly cheaper oysters and more wines/beer options on tap, but a less cozy atmosphere. I would definitely come back but not as frequently as I'll be able to patron The Shop for the price different.

The food was delicious and was plated creatively. The prices were very reasonable too, $15/half dozen oysters, $29/dozen. However, there was a platter with 6 oysters, a great lobster roll, and a cup of clam chowder for only $33.. this is the best deal we've seen all week and left two of us satisfied after ordering Oyster/Prosecco shooters and another half dozen because the oysters were just so good! The decor and set up of the restaurant was amazing. Parking was easy to find, the inside has a very trendy feel, and there was an awesome map to show where each type oyster was from - so cute!

6084,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6084,2019-02-18,"I went here with a party of 10 for myself and my two brothers birthday. I had great expectations for this place, the location is right on the water and actually rocks you back and forth like a baby going to sleep. Unfortunately this is probably the best part of the entire restaurant. 

It was a Saturday night and our waitress was very nice, but the service was slow. Normally I wouldn't mind, but the entire dinner (I shit you not) took three hours. Yes it's seafood, yes it was a Saturday night, yes we had a party of ten. But that is just unacceptable, when the waitress brought our food, everyone had a piece of garlic bread on the side of their plate (nobody's good included it so I assume that was to make up for the wait). This was nice, and arguably one of the best garlic breads I've had. However here is the problem: For 27 dollars for a 12 ounce cut of prime rib, you would expect some sort of vegetable, bread, some seasoned garnish or something. I've never been more disappointed receiving a 27 dollar meal. The cut of meat was cooked well, medium, but it was 20 percent fat, and unseasoned and bland. The au jus sauce tasted nothing better than hot water mixed with  a beef ramen flavoring packet, which you had to dunk into because the entire cut of meat was cold. Not lukewarm, cold to the touch of my tongue. Yes, the outside of the meat that was touching the pan while cooking. Now... maybe the sides would redeem this meal. I was optimistic. I ordered a loaded baked potato, and was excited to have a hot stuffed tater with cheese melting all over and bacon. Again, I shit you not, for 27 dollars they give you a potato (it was baked I'll give DiMillo's that) with chives mixed with sour cream, what looked like shredded mozzarella cheese that comes in the bag from market basket, and shredded bacon IN SEPARATE CUPS. Let me repeat that again, IN SEPARATE CUPS. Come on man, I'm sorry but I feel as if my wallet was raped that night. And my stomach. I cannot speak for any of the seafood, my brothers fiancé got the Salmon and she really enjoyed it. 

In conclusion, if you love seafood and want to be comfortably rocked back and forth while you wait for two hours and then eat extremely overpriced sub par bland food, go to DiMillo's and eat yo heart out. Otherwise hit the damn super market, drizzle some lemon juice with garlic and salt & pepper over a 2 pound filet of your favorite fish, be happy your wallet hasn't been rigorously violated",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

Some minor things would make this a 5* in my book, but it shouldn't hold people back from going and experiencing this restaurant.  Our table ordered about 2-3 of each app.  The meatball had fresh mozzarella on it and was good.  The clams were good, but I found the mussels to be one of the stars of the night.  The broth goes great with the bread.  The crab cakes were good and I found the shrimp cocktails just a tad over cooked, but not too much.  I had the full stuffed 2.5lb lobster.  The stuffing wasn't something that I'd write home about because I was expecting some more texture to it...BUT the lobster was plentiful and prepared well.  I'll tell you the one star of the night was one I least expected - the lobster Mac and Cheese.  Very very tasty!  I looked at another tables order who had the scallops and they looked really good (we also had the bacon wrapped scallops and those were delicious). I was also happy that the server worked with someone I was with to create a custom vegetarian dish. Again, keep in mind that this is a good rating, but with areas to improve on to make it even better.  The IPA's on tap complimented the food nicely.  I would go back for sure, but next time I'd go with the steamed lobster, the lobster mac and cheese or the scallops.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

We had Katherine as the server today and she was unpleasant and very short. I asked her what was good and she decided to repeat the side items a couple times. Then I asked again and she said everything was good. Since ordering our drinks, she was already impatient and unpleasant. I asked for another server and a few times when Katherine passed by, she gave me a nasty look, cut her eyes at me, and even later stood on the raised seating area and stared. This is uncalled for and immature of someone at her age. She shouldn't be in the food and bev business if she can't provide good service. Lisa, on the other hand, had been the complete opposite with her service and demeanor. If not for Lisa, we would've gotten up and left.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "

6088,cKPfe87TXWw26-ggHTwJvw,dimillo's-on-the-water,6088,2018-04-03,"My family (husband and two young teen boys) were visiting from Michigan, and we were looking forward to a lobster dinner on our last night in Portland. After reading tons of reviews, I settled on DiMillo's. 

There was no wait (Monday night) which was nice. The staff seemed bored and not very welcoming, but I wasn't upset by it at all. Our server was very slow to come to our table, and wasn't very attentive the entire meal. She did, however, take the time to explain how to break apart lobster (it was our first time eating it), which was nice. I wasn't too thrilled that she carded my husband for his drink but didn't card me! Haha, I'm 36 and my husband is 37. 

I ordered the seafood scampi and the rest of the family ordered lobster. The scampi was disappointing--I definitely would not recommend it. It didn't have much flavor at all, and needed salt. The scallops in the scampi were good, but the shrimp and lobster were over cooked. 

My family enjoyed trying lobster for the first time, but all agreed it was overrated. Certainly not worth $230! 

One thing that I really appreciated was that the owner came to our table and chatted with us for a couple of minutes. He was very kind. 

Overall, I gave DiMillo's two stars because of the subpar service, aloof staff, and just so-so food. I was hoping to rave about it, but we wouldn't go there again.",3.5,3,"['25 Long Wharf', 'Portland, ME 04101']",43.6542111338841,-70.2506053447723,"American (New), Seafood, Italian, "
