0,"The best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. Taste of good cheese and seasoning without being over powering or bland. 

The maple lemonade is awesome because you can sweeten as much as you want with maple syrup.

Also note I am giving this five stars for southern food, and I am from Georgia!"
1,"Ok....I saw the reviews....I heard all about the experience...however, today I found out for myself. I had breakfast with my friend  who absolutely loves this place (She orders the same thing each visit, lol) so we know it must be really good! 

I really had a hard time deciding...don't judge me I've only been vegetarian for one day now! Maybe next year we can talk about a vegan menu. Just bear with me for right now! I finally decided on the French Toast with a side of fruit. I can't seem to come across the correct adjective to describe my thoughts when my fork touched my mouth. I felt transported....out of my body....the perfect combination of sweet, fulfilling, and absolutely delicious. I mean perfect. 

I'm sure I'll be a regular....no frequent....I mean borderline stalker at this place. Next time a Bloody Mary (since I hear they're amazing) and some other wonderful menu item to tickle my fancy! 

Try it.....I sincerely doubt you will be disappointed. I can also see why there would be a wait; the experience is totally worth it."
2,"They don't take reservations for breakfast or lunch, but it is totally worth the wait. We walked in on a Sunday at 11, and it was about a 45 min wait (actually 20 min shorter). We hung out at a coffee shop across the street. 

Once there, we ordered salmon eggs benny and the mother clucker. Starting with the Cajun Bloody Mary. Spicy and refreshing! The food was great! I wish I ordered the kale, but the grits were great. Our favorite breakfast spot so far in Portland!!"
3,Yum! Best waffle I've ever eaten. Latte was delicious. Eggs were cooked perfectly. We were greeted by smiling staff and waited longer for a table than we did for our food. We will definitely be back soon!
4,"Brunch time!! :) We have heard a lot about this place and we decided to try it out today. We got the corned beef hash and the waffle plate with a side of bacon. The hash was delicious - both tender and crispy with the right amount of sweetness from the carrot. The biggest surprise was the waffle; Hot Suppa has somehow perfected the art of a ""crispy"" waffle! The service was great and we're looking forward to another breakfast here soon :)"
5,"I live in a pretty foodie location where we throw around terms like farm-to-table and locavore like it's discussing the day's weather. 

I was told Portland has an amazing food scene and it did not disappoint. 

That said, there were a couple of places that stood out the most above the others; this was one of them.

We came here for Sunday early breakfast before heading back to VT. We were shocked to see how many enthusiastic early morning diners there were and that there was already a 35 minute wait at 9am. Not to worry-we like great food enough to chill and wait our turn for some amazing grub.

The hostess was super nice and made sure my s.o. and others had coffee while we waited. A couple of chairs opened up at the bar and we were glad to take them when offered. Willie G, our server and bartender du jour was great. When he wasn't mixing up drinks for the servers and serving food to other bar guests, he took the time for a friendly chat. 

As we knew we had along drive and the menu just looked too good to behave, we ordered a smoked salmon eggs benedict for me, a canadian bacon one for him, and we split a breakfast special: banana brad french toast with bananas, chocolate syrup, whipped cream and powered sugar. Um yeah, we were being piggies, but it was so worth it.

I also ordered a mimosa, which came in a large pint glass generously filled with champagne and then a nice dose of OJ. I got a hot chocolate as well which came in a large handled mug with whipped cream. Both were fantastic. 

The eggs...now, I am fairly an aficionado of eggs benedict. So when I say these were hands down the best I have ever eaten, it's no joke. The Hollandaise was so light and airy with a touch of lemon and a teensy hint of heat that I could have ordered just that and bread to dip in. The smoked salmon was of a very high quality. Seriously good eats. The s.o. said the same.

The banana bread french toast was to die for. We took half of it home to not overindulge and to allow a proper second tasting.

It was pricey breakfast, but well worth it IMO. I have no issue shelling out money for excellent food and service. 

I'm sure we will visit his family again here, so I definitely want to come back here for lunch and dinner in the future. 

It's a restaurant to put on your list to visit when in town."
6,"Visited from out of state. This may have been my favorite restaurant.

Limited seating, so we lucked out and got in at the right time.

Went during happy hour. $1 Otter Cover oysters. Delicious. Served with lemon and a spicy cocktail sauce. 

The corn chowder with shrimp was excellent.

Wait staff was polite.

Must try when in Portland!"
7,"Early on this summer, we made a stop here as a family and chose to sit out back on the 'patio/back deack/rear yard' sort of situation downtown Portland is known for trying to have. 

With 2 kids under age 3, it seemed better to have both high chairs outside as the interior seems quite small. On a weekend during brunch, it is rather quickly crowded and it was a nice enough day.

The prices were on the higher end of what I consider a nicer brunch...so 10-15 per person with more elaborate or specialized dishes only found during brunch or as daily offerings.

If we go bacck as a date night, we will try other items and sit inside, but the hours of operation are a touch odd and make it a lower on the list option."
8,"Great, but busy spot in the West End of Portland.  I've been coming to Hot Suppa for years, and for some reason my visits aren't frequent, but every time I go back I wonder why I've stayed away for so long.  

Three of us visited on a Monday afternoon. The wait was short, maybe 15 mins, despite it being summer.  We were seated and promptly greeted.  

We ordered a round of drinks, I had the Cajun bloody which was spicy and awesome. The garnish is pickled green beans, okra, and olive. A total flavor sensation.  My partner and friend had mimosas, which came in a pint glass... score!  

Our food was phenomenal.  The Cubano sandwich and the Mother Clucker were decadent and SO filling.  The Mother Clucker is an open faced chicken on a biscuit as gravy with fresh green onions on the gravy.  We also had a red/green burrito and a side of fried green tomatoes. Those were Oh So good.

After this experience, I won't make may next visit as far in the future as I did before, I'm storing Hot Suppa in my memory bank."
9,"I had heard a lot about this restaurant and was excited to try it. Unfortunately, our first impression wasn't great as the hostess wasn't the friendliest to us. The wait was close to an hour which was fine as it was Saturday brunch and they don't take reservations. We were offered to sit outside in the rain since tables were moving faster there. The hostess gave us menus and utensils wrapped in napkins. It seemed like they were understaffed but it would have been nice if someone had shown us the way to our table. 

Our waitress was very nice. We ordered the French toast and French styled omelette. It was a very good omelette and I liked the fillings that were available. I upgraded to the cornbread and wow was it good and thick. We enjoyed our meal but the hospitality in the beginning wasn't great. This is a restaurant that if we were to come back to the area, we would like to give it another try and write a better review in the future."
10,"This was by far one of the greatest meals that I had while in Maine. There brunch was to die for. We ate several items which were good, but the entire table LOVED my fried green tomato Benedict. 

This was the perfect blend of flavors and the fried green tomato was cooked perfectly. 

The one thing we didn't really enjoy was the Corned Beef Hash. The ratio of potatoes and onions to meat was off, it seemed like just a bunch of meat with one or two pieces of potato and onion."
11,"Walked in early on a Friday morning and got probably the last table available; there was a line out the door by the time we left. Given that and the rave reviews on Yelp, I was very excited to try this place.

Hot Suppa does its best to bring southern food to the northern states, with middling results. My boyfriend and I split the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with gravy and blueberry waffles. Though he loved the chicken sandwich, I wasn't a fan - the coating was soggy, the gravy was mediocre, and the hash browns weren't crispy. Also it was all white meat, so pretty dry. The bluberry waffles were SUPER thin (which I actually liked better), and the sauce/whipped cream was pretty delicious. Waffle itself wasn't anything special, though.

Sadly I didn't get a chance to try any of the coffee drinks, which looked pretty interesting."
12,We had lunch there.  The atmosphere and the food was memorable. I had the Cubano and fries. Both were filling. A friend had the tomato soup. Definitely homemade soup.  Bartender was friendly.
13,"I can't find anything wrong with this place ...

We stopped here on the way home from Acadia on the way back to CT. Was instantly drawn to them for happy hour that featured $1 oysters. We were seated instantly in the cute outdoor area, though had plenty of inside choices too. 
Great cocktail drinks features for $1 during HH (I guess maybe they could do even more deals ‚Äç) and they hit the spot. Oysters were great and the wings were crispy, saucy, and quite yummy. These apps, along with the specials board, convinced us we wanted dinner too. 
All the food was very fresh, beautifully plated, and delicious.  Great values considering how fresh the ingredients were. Took a little while to come out, but served warm and looked great. Our waitress was also very attentive and helpful. 

Would recommend if you are looking for a genuinely good bite to eat.  Also appreciate a good single stall, clean bathroom."
14,I was really excited to try the fried chicken at hot suppa. I have to say based on the reviews I had high hopes but was rather let down. We tried the fried chicken which I felt was too sweet. The sweet tea brine makes the chicken a little uncomfortably sweet over savory. The Mac and cheese was creamy but could have used more texture from the breakcrumbs. The salad had lettuce that was clearly not fresh and was just overall not impressive. Their collards were fine and the cornbread was slightly too dry Maybe their brunch is better.
15,"Man, what a place! The fried chicken was crispy and tender and well seasoned. The portion size is generous and the staff was incredibly friendly. Their peach cobbler was superb, and it was gluten free too. Everyone could eat here and be happy! I'm from the South, and they're doing Southern right up here in Maine. Hot Suppa is the spot!"
16,"After driving 6 hours from Long Island, we arrived at Hot Suppa for breakfast. And what a breakfast!

Get there early and prepare to struggle to find parking. We got there at 7:30 on a Friday and were seated right away, but the line was out the door by 8:30. 

The servers were super friendly and fast, and drinks and food were excellent. My friend got the Cajun Bloody Mary which was nicely spicy (they're known for their bloodys so you can't go wrong) and I got the greyhound cocktail with gin. Also can't go wrong with gin and grapefruit juice. 

Their portions are generous. And so are the prices. The mother clucker is delightfully heavy, and even the fried green tomato BLT was gigantic and hearty. 

I wish I had the opportunity to come back for dinner. Next time!!!"
17,"Read rave reviews for here so of course, i had to SUPPA fly here....ok i tried

The wait for a Saturday night around 730 wasnt bad at all.  Got seated for a table of 3 and the server was very attentive to us right away.

Ordered the charbroiled oysters, also ordered the $1.50 oysters (right!?!? 1.50?!?!) and the 3 of us ordered the friedchicken, as it was the most popular choice).  I was SUPER TEMPTED to order the nashville fried chicken because of the VERY HOT, YOU TRY ON YOUR OWN RISK spicy warning but i was also scared.

The server offered to have the sauce on the side for a buck more, which i happily comply with.  For my side, i ordered the shirmp, corn gumbo

Ok lets start with the oysters - now now, lets not start a yelp storm, BUT...it was my first time having it -_-, so does my review count?  YES!  The charbroiled ones were delicious, with that garlic butter and parm...OMGGGOODDNESSS...why are you delicious.  Then i had my raw oyster...i mean...for a 1.5, if i didnt like it...it didnt hurt my wallet.  It was a bit more on the sweeter end but i have to say...it wasnt my favorite (cause i dont like the texture)

Ok...enough already - to the main course....my CHICKEN.  So sidenote - i was a bit upset that my friend got like an extra piece of chicken (3 in total) and i only got 2, wth?!  Anyways, so here is my chicken, i believe one was thigh and one was breast.  The skin was crispy and flavorful, not thin crispy though.  The chicken meat itself...could have use a bit more love with some seasoning..i felt like it could have seep in a bit more.  The chicken, i do have to say...was moist and not dry.  I had a hard time finding the meat in one of my piece so i was a bit sad.  
The gumbo soup was a bit disappointing...i felt like it was a bit on the lighter side where as the gumbo texture is much thick and rich.  I even tried adding the nashville hot sauce to it to see if it would taste (dont do it!)

ONTO my main point - the nashville sauce...to be honest, it is spicy...like shit does kinda hurt...BUT BUT BUT! the part that im upset about it....it is nasty bitter...it has nothing but bitter and burn, so it was not enjoyable! Can you imagine if i have gotten my fried chicken covered in that?! I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED!!  I had to mix it with ketchup to enjoy the chicken."
18,"Great brunch. Very small place, so be prepared to wait. Not inexpensive either, but awesome eggs benny!"
19,"We had the best time at Hot Suppa. We got some drinks, the wine was great, and some wings. They were so good we ordered seconds! The staff was also really friendly and helped us get a table even though we didn't have a reservation. It definitely got busy, even on a freezing cold winter night so plan ahead and reserve a table if you can. The atmosphere is cozy because the place is so small and we really overall just loved everything about it. Can't wait to go back!"
20,"The cup of shrimp, corn and andouille chowder is a must-have. Just the right amount of heat paired with a full-bodied chowder. Great for a cold day! Falafel salad was simple, with great dressing and Pineland Farm cheese was a great compliment. This lunch combo was a good pair."
21,"This was our first stop in Maine (during our road trip to Maine). Parking was a little bit of a hassle, but we parked on the street not too far away from the restaurant (but.. 25 cents for 12 minutes @.@). We got seated after waiting for 10-15 minutes.
I ordered hash beef with two pouched eggs (chose hash brown instead of grits), and my husband ordered motherclucker. They were both solid brunch options. We both agreed that hash beef was cooked to perfection and was the best one we've had so far. My husband really enjoyed the gravy over chicken, but we had better ones when we did our trip to Georgia. Coffee and other drinks were okay. Enjoyed our first meal in Maine."
22,"My group stopped here for brunch on a recent trip to Portland. and WOW. We all agreed that these were the best eggs benedict we've ever had. The eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes is absolutely fantastic. The tomatoes were really crispy but so juicy on the inside. Hash browns were alright, not too crispy or flavorful. The mother clucker is another solid option. It is super flavorful and filling. 

Each brunch item will set you back around $15, but I think it's worth a stop on any visit to Portland.

They also have an extensive coffee/latte menu if you want some caffeine with your brunch."
23,"I was so excited to try the food, considering raving reviews. We arrived around 1, when the place was dying out. We waited around 7-10 minutes for a table. Breakfast & lunch is served until 2pm. At 2, doors are locked and new customers are not allowed. Usually, the place is packed, so your best bet is to arrive like we did, an hour before closing. 

The atmosphere is casual. Large, wooden furniture. Modern and classical hits playing on the radio. Cozy atmosphere. Pleasant to relax over a friendly chat. Not a lot of spacing, so not suitable for large parties.

The staff are very friendly and helpful. Service is quick, so nothing to remark on there.
 
We were starving, so were super ready for some rockin food based on stellar reviews and our Airbnb host's recommendations. What we got was underwhelming.

My bf got the soup (with shrimp) with grilled cheese ($9). Tiny cup of soup and a small sandwich. Not filling for anyone, especially a man. The soup was hearty and slightly spicy, solid flavor, no complaints. Wish the portion was bigger. Grilled cheese was nothing spectacular. 

I got corned beef hash ($17), which was the establishment special. The waitress highly recommended it so of course I had high expectations. Per waitress's suggestion, ordered it with hollandaise (which they make in house) on the side. The tiny paper cup was an additional $2 charge, which was a bit pricey. Hollandaise was delicious, no complaints there. Very creamy and light. Per recommendation, got the grits instead of hash. Regretted that decision. Grits were very watery and I couldn't eat much of it. Corned beef itself was well cooked, but nothing special, probably the most forgettable I've ever had. The portion comes with two eggs any way. I chose eggs Benedict. Huge disappointment. Eggs were stale and flavorless. Probably the worst eggs Benedict I've ever had. Overall, the entire dish was a let down. Expected so much more. Especially for $19, which is a dinner restaurant price for a plate, not for a simple breakfast egg dish. You can find much better for a better price.

Maine maple latte ($5) was tasty, but too sweet. 

Overall, average food, comfy, casual atmosphere, but not worth the money. You can find better."
24,"Maybe not a hidden gem anymore but truly a local treasure.  We arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning and the wait was already about 25 minutes but heed my advice and do the wait because it is so worth it!  

Moving on the food, wow just wowwww! I died and went to Eggs Benny heaven when I took a bite out of my order which I brilliantly topped with Fried Green Tomatoes.  I am still patting my own back for choosing that combo and wondered why I've not seen this option before, not even in New Orleans? The folks here at Hot Suppa really have something extraordinary.  Even the hash browns side was deliriously tasty.  My daughter couldn't sing enough praises for their French Omelette. 

Needless to say, this was one of our most memorable meals on our weekend getaway to Portland."
25,"Found this place while researching ""must try"" restaurants in Portland.  The Benedict was recommended.  Came on a Sunday so the wait was pretty bad, but I'm not even factoring that into the review because that's normal.  In fact, it made me pretty optimistic.

My husband got the eggs Benedict with bacon, I got it with the Smoked Salmon.  The were both just Okay, nothing to write home about but the hash browns were actually just disgusting.  They didn't even taste like potatoes.  I don't know if we got a batch of rotten potatoes or they cook them in something unusual, but they were gross.  We both got the runs shortly after coming home.  

I realllllly wanted to like this place :/"
26,"NO PRIVATE LOT. Must find street parking which is a pain! After you park, another obstacle, the wait! If you get hangry, find another restaurant! I got the Mother Clucker, basically the Biscuit & Sausage Gravy Benedict with boneless fried chicken. Very filling. Everything was great!"
27,"My first inclination was to run the other way, when I saw the crowd packed into the entrance waiting for tables on a Friday morning. But I'm glad my wife and I waited...it only took about 20 minutes, and the breakfast was well worth it. We each had eggs benedict...for her, the traditional kind, for me, a smoked salmon variety. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent."
28,"I've enjoyed most of my meals here. The weight staff is always friendly and personable, though the wait time can often be time prohibitive. 

For Portland, the prices are good. A dinner for one, with a beer and app can be done for $25 or less.

I hail from the South and really enjoy the fried greet tomatoes. However, this East Coast idea that ""shrimp and grits"" or ""chicken and waffles"" is a thing in the deep south is fiction. No offense to Hot Suppa, everybody does it. I only mention it because the shrimp and grits just aren't very good. The name is appealing what the texture, taste and consistency is just, well, a bit gross. So pass on that when you visit. 

Not the biggest dessert menu but who needs it when you have so much other (good) food to choose from?!"
29,"I liked it. 

But the food wasn't good enough to outweigh the wait, lack of parking and impersonal service. 

The sausage gravy is awesome, biscuits were good. Everything else lacked flavor, but kudos for the variety of hot sauce and condiments on the table.

The host was nice, our server wasn't rude but barely spoke. 

If there was no wait I might try again, but based on the 700+ reviews I don't think that's ever the case."
30,"Walked to Hot Suppa this morning. It's in a really charming neighborhood in Portland. It is very small so if you are 2+ party be prepared to wait 40+ mins before getting seated. I was alone, so was seated immediately at the bar. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and hash browns. The sandwich was lacking a bit in flavor and could have used more bbq sauce. The bread was however delish and the hash browns were piping hot. 

Very cute spot, but a few tweaks could make it a gem. Thanks Portland!"
31,"I always appreciate restaurants that provide unique and creative brunch dishes. I mean, who can't make toast and eggs at home? Hearing about the southern style flair that Hot Suppa provides on their brunch menu, I was excited to check out all of the goodness. 

As everyone has stated in other reviews, the long waits and lines are not a myth. My husband and I have come a couple times when the wait has been over an hour long. However, sometimes you can hit the restaurant at a decent time (8-9:30am) and only wait about 30 minutes. The restaurant is very small and has limited seating, so sometimes sitting at the bar gets you in a little quicker. 

In a recent trip, I decided to try their famous bloody mary, which had a nice kick to get the day going. Probably one of my favorite bloodies in Portland. One of my friends ordered the maple latte, which was also really good. I ended up ordering the fried green tomato egg benedict, because benedicts are just amazeballs and fried green tomatoes? Why not?! The eggs were cooked to perfection, the tomatoes, flavorful, and the hash browns are cooked crispy and delicious. 

So the food and drinks are great...so why the four stars? First off, as I have stated, the place gets super busy, which I get can be overwhelming and sometimes frustrating. But each time I have come, the hostess has always been rude and uninviting. I would get one day being a little ""off"" but it has been consistent every time. It's just a little off putting. However, the wait staff is always accommodating and nice. Secondly, I find that many of their options are very over-priced. I don't mind putting down some cash for a great brunch, but I found some of their prices were extensive. 

Overall, Hot Suppa does provide a unique brunch experience if you are willing to wait, just be prepared to drop some serious dollah bills, y'all."
32,"Been here a couple of times, almost always a line but worth the wait. I always get the chicken and waffles don't know why I don't change it up but it's so damn good. Parking is kind of a pain in this area, just FYI"
33,"I am so furious right now, I've been to Hot Suppa several times for dinner with friends, I'm in town for a couple of months for work, I went for breakfast today, deliberately choosing a non-rush time, as I was alone, I was asked ""How many"" told the hostess ""Just me"" and was told ""You can sit at the bar"" I said  ""The bar? No, I'd like a table"" there were a few tables available and was told ""Sorry, you have to sit at the bar"". I walked out. Horrifying customer service."
34,"Delicious, reasonably-priced, southern-themed food in a small, cute, cozy atmosphere. Came here once for HH - oysters were cheap at $1/piece but they only had one variety and it didn't blow me away. Second time I came here in early December on a Saturday for brunch at 9:30am for a party of 2 and waited for ~20 minutes. We got bottomless coffee and shared the fried chicken and waffles special and the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs sunnyside up (both were DELISH!) The waffle was thin but comes with a mound of butter that just soaks right in, it was amazing! 

The total was ~$15/person which is not bad at all for brunch in Portland. Plus it was sooooo much food, I took leftovers home for another full meal. I'm from the south and do feel that this place is sort of hyped up just because there aren't a ton of places to get your southern food fix here and wouldn't want to wait an hour to eat here. If you're craving oysters there are better places to go, but the southern items they do, they do very well!"
35,"@@ road trip post @@

Pros:
* Surprisingly short wait for a Friday night. They were able to sit a 6 person party in about 20 minutes. We called ahead to get an idea of what the wait was like.
* Small cute restaurant. 
* Food was okay. Tried the falafel sandwich which... Well, it tasted really fresh and healthy because it had a LOT of chopped lettuce, but also that means it had a very small amount of falafel in it. Roasted beet salad was pretty good. 
* Good local beer selection. Mostly leaning IPA, as they tend to these days.
* We waaaay overstayed our welcome and they didn't make us feel that way at all. We were catching up and didn't realize the restaurant had closed. That was really nice of them, although of course I wish we hadn't been the extra burden.


Cons:
* No personal experience, but a friend who researched workers' rights in Amherst a couple of years ago shared that the owner didn't treat workers well."
36,"Been here a million times but recently went after going vegan. The server was very knowledgeable and accommodating. I ordered hashbrowns topped with saut√©ed veggies and a plain toasted bagel with peanut butter and jelly on the side. For other vegan options, it looks like their falafel salad could be vegan without the tzatziki and feta cheese."
37,"Located across the street from Tandem Coffee. Two great options so near each other!

Street parking here at Hot Suppa, also no call aheads or reservations. We had to wait about 10 min on a Friday morning (holiday weekend), and the space itself is quite small. Very cozy and homey!

Started with a Maine maple latte, they don't have soy milk here but substituted with almond milk and was still very delicious!

Tried their famous corn beef hash and it did not let me down! This was hands down the best corn beef hash I have ever had! Not too salty, real meat, pressed on a griddle to perfection. Served with two eggs, two pieces of toast, and potato hash. We also got a side of grits with cheddar. Don't pass this up!

Highly recommend this place if you are able to snag a seat here on busy breakfast mornings. Thanks for a great and delicious time! Will be back next time I am visiting Portland :)"
38,"Just what I'm looking for in a brunch spot, and I'd be happy to come back and try another meal.

I love their peaceful back patio, and their menu options- I was able to customize my brunch exactly to my liking, both savory and sweet (one bacon waffle, one order of home fries topped with peppers), and it was tasty and well-executed. Service was friendly too.

Note though that you will wait a long time and you may wonder if they've forgotten you- this place is really popular."
39,"Yup, Hot Suppa is THE place to go for a memorable brunch in Portland. Stop by, get your name on the list and then circle back in an hour or so. 
The corned beef hash was unique and out of this world with flavor, I'd highly recommend it. They've got phenomenal coffee, and plenty of other cool drinks to tickle your fancy. 
Attentive, knowledgeable servers and a cool decor. We sat outside and a hidden patio/courtyard around back that I didn't know existed. I'm excited to continue my journey thru the menu's many tasty options next time!"
40,"As others mention, this restaurant is small and VERY popular. My friend and I arrived around 10:30am on a Monday and were surprised to find a considerable wait. This is definitely not the place to come with a large party! There's also almost no space in which to cool your heels and wait, so take that into consideration when you make your plans. Anyway, the food and service were great! My friend had been lamenting the lack of good iced tea in Portland, but Hot Suppa delivered. I also loved my ice mocha. My breakfast choice - the three-egg scramble with a side of kale salad and the cornbread - was incredibly filling and very flavorful. Definitely worth the visit if you are in Portland!"
41,"For a Southern Soul Food spot far away from the South, this place is pretty good.  

While visiting Portland with my wife and 4-month-old son, we picked this placed based on reviews and were quite impressed.  We were able to get in quickly and the service was excellent.  We ordered several things to share.  We got a few oysters (they were only $1.50 each so why not), the poutine, the catfish tacos, shrimp and grits, and the Fried Chicken with Mac and Cheese.

The Oysters were really good!  They tasted fresh and the housemade cocktail sauce was absolutely delicious.  And since my wife does not like oysters, I got these all to myself :):):)

The Catfish Tacos were amazing.  Having never eaten catfish before I really don't know what it should taste like, but if it tastes like that I WANT MOOOOOOREE!!!

The poutine was a little disappointing to me.  Having grown up in Canada and being a little bit of a food snob, I may be being a little bit harsh, but poutine is near and dear to my heart and I feel like I have to defend it.  But then, I did order a Canadian classic at a southern soul food place so what can I expect.  I just felt like the gravy needed more seasoning, so still not a bad choice.

The shrimp and grits were good, but they were not what I was expecting.  The sauce/gravy that was on the shrimp tasted quite tomatoey, which was strange to me.  It was seasoned kinda like a tomato vegetable soup, but again, since I have never had shrimp and grits before I can't be super harsh on this.  The shrimp was cooked very well and still tasted great!

The Mac and Cheese was the star of the night. It was delicious! (For the one bite I got to taste).  I had ordered my piece of fried chicken in the Nashville Hot seasoning, and while it tasted super good and I thoroughly enjoyed it, it was so hot that I could not taste anything else.  I would absolutely order the Hot chicken again, but would wait until the end of the meal to eat it so I got to enjoy everything else.

Overall, this place was very god and I wouldn't be opposed to going back in the future :)"
42,"Delicious! Went here for a late brunch. It's pretty small inside, but we only waited a few minutes for a table. I had the red green burrito. You could add meat for an extra charge, which I didn't do. It came with scrambled eggs, beans, peppers, hash browns and cheese. I liked how I could tell the hash browns were crispy even in the burrito. It was a good size and very filling. The menu looked good with lots of options I would want to try if I came back!"
43,"Came here because I heard that this has the best corned beef hash in Portland!

Went in on a Sunday around 1030 and waited about 25-30 minutes for a table for 2.

I always grade places by their corned beef hash, and this place did not let me down! The exterior was crisp and on the inside were actual pieces of corned beef instead of the usual mash of meat.  I am pretty impressed with the food. The sourdough wasn't too tangy but it was perfect to wipe down the plate after I ate my over easy eggs. The coffee is great, definitely a strong blend and not your typical watered down coffee.

My advice would be to come early, put your name down, and wait patiently. If you aren't there when they call your name, they will go to the next party on the list. And when you come back you'll be first in line again to receive a table, unless there's other people in the same situation as you."
44,"My mom and I went to Hot Suppa for lunch on a Thursday and were told the wait was an hour! Being dedicated brunchers, we gladly waited in the cool AC, and to our delight, we were seated in a booth in 15 minutes!

Because we both wanted chicken and waffles, we ordered two waffles, and the Mother Clucker. They will not make substitutions! Prices are standard, but borderline overpriced. $3 for a glass of iced tea? $2 for Maine Maple syrup? Not the cheapest brunch, but worth it!

The fried chicken wasn't the best I've had, as it wasn't super crunchy and flavorful, but it was juicy and the coating had a nice peppery taste. I also shared my mom's creamy, shredded hash browns with a golden brown crust. Yum. My favorite part by far was the waffle with a buttery, vanilla taste. Somehow, the thin, crispy waffle still possessed moisture with a light texture. Next visit, I'll order a waffle plate, because the eggs look perfectly cooked."
45,"Small restaurant however the food is amazing! Definitely worth the wait, if you encounter a wait. Just street parking, probably at a meter. Still worth it! I ordered the corn beef with egg on marble rye. It also had a slice of melted Swiss  between the corn beef and egg. The egg yolk was just a bit runny, which is perfect! The sandwich was filling and tasty! My daughter had the red green burrito  and she enjoyed hers as well. I had a taste and it was filled with scrambled eggs and black beans and peppers. The taste was amazing! Definitely a place to check out if visiting Portland! They are closed between 2-5pm."
46,"We had an amazing and delicious meal. Started of with the Charbroiled oysters - they were so good, came with bread to absorb the flavorful sauce. I have tried a lot of fish tacos but these were the best. I had a side of cornbread and collards, which were perfect. We also had deviled eggs - 2 types and both were delicious. I highly recommend this place."
47,"Amazing food! Full disclosure- be prepared to wait and wait and wait.....and wait some more if you want to partake in the enlightening tastes of Hot Suppa (or arrive super early). 

That out of the way...wife and I indulge a breakfast or two every month at Hot Suppa. This is a very small restaurant, as is almost every restaurant in Portland Proper. Put your name on the list and grab some coffee. Be alert at the sound of your name as well because they will only call it once. 

Now, the food! Wonderful, absolutely wonderful. The waffles are crisp and light and perfectly made. The real maple syrup goes a long way draped over the waffle. The eggs are Gordon Ramsay quality. Light, fluffy, warm, and decadent. The maple bacon is crisp and meaty. 

The service! Genuine smiles and swift service. They are attentive and proactive in ensuring a quality experience once seated. 

This is a favorite of ours in Portland. If you find yourself in Portland or if you live here, you are missing out if you don't endure the wait to eat at Hot Suppa."
48,I've been wanting to try this place for a while since it's right down the street from me and I finally went for brunch with my aunt on Monday and it was great! As a vegetarian I felt they had lots of options for me which was great I got the French toast which was fantastic and my aunt got the falafel salad that she loved. It's small and cozy with art for sale on the walls which I loved and our waitress was super sweet! I will definitely be back.
49,"We love Hot Suppa for breakfast. The space is small and you can expect a wait, but it is worth it. Service is also always great."
50,"Loved this place! Came here during happy hour (4-6) and there was no wait. During happy hour, oysters are $1 each, and also $1 off all drinks. We got two rounds of oysters (20 total for the two of us), an appetizer portion of the Nashville hot chicken (one piece), and I also had a cocktail. 

The oysters were extremely fresh and yummy and came with a lovely horseradish sauce. My cocktail was also delicious and generously sized. The Nashville hot chicken, which was advertised as being extremely spicy and covered in a layer of cayenne, was as such but also finger licking delicious! The waitress was extremely nice and helpful, especially in describing the chicken and coming to check in on us or bring napkins every once in a while. I'd happily have the chicken again, but my boyfriend probably wouldn't. He said his face went numb and he couldn't taste a thing.

Highly recommend stopping by!"
51,"I could tell you all about how Hot Suppa is the best spot for brunch in Portland, but a few hundred people already beat me to the punch on that one.  Instead, I'll tell you why you should go there for dinner.

Cold night plus Hot Suppa is the best Portland winter combination.  The spicy, hearty soul food is enough to make anyone forget about the giant ice storm that is probably taking place on any given night in Maine.  The ""Hot Cat"" (like shrimp and grits only with fried catfish) and the ""fried chicken and a side"" are my favorites on their standard menu, but the specials are usually top notch as well.  Some of their sides are better than others, ask your server what is best.  Want brunch food for dinner, they always have their famous chicken and waffles!

The dinner prices here are pretty standard for a casual restaurant in Portland ($15-$20 for an entree) and there is no way you will ever leave hungry.  Oh, and the best part about dinner...usually not much of a wait."
52,"I really wanted to like this place, as I'm from the south, and can't resist a good plate of biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits and gravy I was served here were disappointingly bland. Nothing makes me sadder. I also wished the hash browns were crispier all the way through. Once I got past the top crispy part, which was delightful, the rest of the potatoes were soft and boring. It needed something to give it more pep. My sunny-side up eggs were cooked perfectly, however, with runny yolks that mingled so well with my hash browns.

I don't want to completely write this place off, since so much of their food sounds and looks delicious. My fellow diners ordered omelettes, which were rolled French-style and polished off with enthusiasm. Seems like this is a popular place, so they must be doing something right (they certainly do their eggs right) but unfortunately, I can't recommend their biscuits and gravy. I'm resolving to come back to try the rest of their menu"
53,Great place for a great breakfast. I had the corned beef egg sandwich on marble rye and my wife had the waffle plate. Excellent service and top of the line food!
54,"After numerous recommendations, I was finally able to make my way to Hot Suppa for brunch this past weekend. I had initially tried to come on Thursday however the wait was over an hour and my hunger could not wait that long. When we came back this weekend the wait was about 35 minutes, which was reasonable given the popularity of this place and the limited seating available.

I have to say, my biggest turn off about this place was the hostess. Super unfriendly. She was there both times I came and each time was just as unfriendly. When you try to put your name in, she has a way of making you feel like you are inconveniencing her and whenever she gives a wait time it almost seem like she gives longer wait times in hopes of having you leave. Definitely not a good first impression.

The restaurant itself is super cute. There is nice art on the walls and it has a very homey/diner feel. The seating is super limited which certainly doesn't help the wait times.

The menu was decent and offered a variety of options. Prices were a little expensive in my opinion. I got a Bloody Mary and the Biscuit and Gravy for my meal.

The Bloody was tasty, but not my favorite. It was garnished with an olive, green been, and okra which I thought was rather odd.

The meal was really quite good. The gravy and biscuit were both delicious and the hash browns on the side were also excellent.

My friend also got the Maple Latte which was amazing. Definitely recommend this.

Service was quick and the server was extremely friendly and helpful.

Given the wait, prices and the hostess, I'm not sure if I will come back. However, the food was excellent."
55,"My wife and I are from Missouri.  We KNOW good fried chicken.  Ley me tell you that if you don't eat fried chicken at Hot Suppa, you are missing out big time!  The coating on their chicken and how it is perfectly cooked makes it the best that I have ever eaten.  I'm 67 and I have eaten fried chicken everywhere.  And if that is not enough, their mac-n-cheese is insanely good.  The mixture of cheddars in this is absolutely perfect. This is definitely on our top restaurant dishes anywhere!"
56,"Everything was wonderful, just like other reviews have said.  Have been wanting to try Hot Suppa for a long time and glad we decided to go.  Got right in at dinner time but they told us there is usually a long wait for brunch.

We got the Hot Cat: cornmeal crusted catfish filet, Geechie Boy grits, shrimp, chili peppers, spicy butter (gluten free); Fried Chicken and Buttermilk  Waffle with whipped butter and Maine maple syrup and one of us got the Fried Chicken with Mac and Cheese on the side.  Everything was fantastic!  You really should go there!"
57,"I've read a number of Yelp reviews about Hot Suppa because I wanted to see what others said about the long wait time there, which is a constant issue. Many remarked the venue is popular hence the excessive delay in getting seated, which I experienced and found off-putting,  Since they do not take reservations I was stuck waiting for nearly an hour with my guests when I was there last.  That is way too long.  Therefore keep this in mind as you will wait if you go to Hot Suppa for breakfast on the weekend; I cannot speak for weekdays.

Generally speaking the food at Hot Suppa is good.  Is it extraordinary as some would say?  No, I do not think so; yet ""good"" in any restaurant carries weight from my perspective.

Hot Suppa is pricey.  Once upon a time Portland had a vastly different demographic that would not support the prices many venues charge today.  Pursuantly, Hot Suppa is supported by people who have the means to pay their prices for their meals.  Just keep this factor in mind if Hot Suppa is on your radar screen.

I would go back and try Hot Suppa for dinner out of curiosity."
58,My husband and I stopped in on a trip from out of town after reading this was a must visit place. I would say the entrees met expectations for what I want at any restaurant and the dessert fell far short. They had a few good beers on tap but there wasn't much variety. This place is vastly overrated.
59,Great food and great service. It's very small so be sure to get there early if you want a seat. Accommodating of allergies.
60,"Great food and cozy atmosphere.  Enjoyed the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and the gravy with biscuits was pretty good. Would come back for their dollar oysters.

***Update: came back for the happy hour for drinks and oysters. Very good deal for $1 oysters."
61,"I almost hate to talk about this wonderful restaurant in the West End, only because it's small and I don't want to wait to get in. This place is so good though that I have to take the chance. The food is more ""Southern"" style than ""American"" (whatever that means) as you won't see shrimp & grits or fried green tomatoes on another menu in Greater Portland. I recently had my usual Hurricane, catfish tacos &, of course, those rarely seen fried green tomatoes, followed up by chocolate bourbon bread pudding, the best dessert in town. I'm a fussy eater but the interesting menu has plenty of options for me as well for more sophisticated palates. Get out of the Old Port and try Hot Suppa. I know you'll like it but please, do me a favor and don't tell anyone."
62,"My husband and I stumbled on this restaurant on our way home from our mini honeymoon in Portland - it was just around the block from our air bnb.  Man did we luck out!  We waited about 20 minutes which was no problem at all.  We ended up ordering the Maine maple sweet tea to start - lord was it good.  I ended up getting the pulled pork breakfast sandwich with hash browns and my husband opted for an omelette with grits.  Let's just say that my dish was life changing.  It was everything I wanted - southern soul food, fresh eggs, and the best potatoes.  I am so glad we found this funky place"
63,Perfect for brunch - the service was friendly and the staff were very quick and accommodating to my party (which features a toddler). The cheese grits and biscuits and gravy were perfect and the coffee was spot-on as well.
64,"We came into Hot Suppa for some breakfast on a week day! Be prepared to wait. We were quoted an hour and it ended up being slightly less, but that's still quite a long time for the middle of the week. Unfortunately, they do not do pagers/buzzers or text notifications, which means you need to stand in the cramped lobby to wait to hear your name. They really need to add some sort of text notification service given how long the waits are here. Fortunately, the food is worth the wait! I had the biscuits and gravy (my fav!) with poached eggs and perfectly cooked hash browns. They have tons of hot sauce options at the table as well. Our server was bubbly and sweet, and always had a big smile on her face! With some sort of table notification service, this place would be 5/5 stars!"
65,"Absolutely awesome breakfast spot. Had the pulled pork breakfast sandwich and loved it. Went on a Friday and there was no wait, came back on Saturday to try some other items and there was a 1.5 hour wait. Definitely a hot spot in town. Try to check it out during non peak hours. Menu looked amazing and I will be back to try other items! For more pics and reviews checkout @BuehEats on instagram"
66,"I've been trying to eat breakfast at Hot Suppa for YEARS. It's just that every time we think of it, there is a 45 minute wait and we decide to go somewhere else. We finally got our act together and got up a little earlier. After a 20 minute or so wait, we ended up seated at the bar. The bartender was so friendly and the Saturday morning jams were a perfect way to start my day.

I get it. I get why people wait! First, the bloody mary. It was just what I look for in a bloody. A good punch of spice (without killing your taste buds) and the perfect drink snacks - pickled dilly beans and okra. It was equally good without vodka. Second, the food. To eat, I had one of their specials - pork with tomato gravy, over cheesy grits with the most perfect biscuits. Oh! And two perfect poached eggs! My husband devoured his (yes, we got the same thing), but I was conscious to savor every bite (so unlike me). It was one of those times where I was actually very sad that I couldn't finish my plate. 

It's a tight squeeze in there, so I wouldn't go with a group or if I'm super hungry before I even leave my house. Needless to say, I'll be back and I can't wait to try dinner!!"
67,This was absolutely delicious! I ordered a fried chicken sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese. The sandwich was mouth watering and the Mac n cheese was super cheesy. I would have preferred slightly less pepper in the Mac n cheese but that is purely based on my personal tastebuds. One of the other people I was eating with said that this was the best burger he has ever had. The biggest down side is that the booth was so uncomfortable that old spinal injuries were in serious pain for two of the people in my party by the time we finished eating. The staff were very nice but a bit slow.
68,"Good food, not great. The grits are what I was excited to try, especially after recently seeing a tv doc on Geechie Boy Grits. Unfortunately, they were a little watery for my liking & lacked some flavor. Their friend chicken was real good, as well as their waffle."
69,"Food is delicious but they could benefit off or expanding a bit since there's always a wait. We came twice in the same weekend we were visiting Portland. Saturday we arrived at about 11 and we were given a wait estimate of about 1 hour to an hour and 15 mins. Two spots opened up at the bar before the estimated time so we sat there. Service was great, food was delicious. 

Came back on Sunday 45 mins after they opened and the wait was still over an hour. How?! Currently waiting to be seated because the food was that good, hoping today doesn't disappoint...."
70,This place was great for breakfast. Arrived Saturday just before 9am and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The bloody Mary's were good and a bit spicy. We ordered the French omelet special and the sloppy joe eggs Benedict....both were fantastic. I had hash browns with mine and my husband had the grits both of those were also delicious. I usually don't finish my breakfast but the portion was just right and the food was to good to not clean our plates. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. A must visit.
71,"Had somewhat high expectations going into brunch at Hot Suppa and left pretty disappointed.

Wait was 25ish minutes (9am on a Wednesday), which we were fine with. Took a while to get our order in and food, but we understand it was busy and whatnot. Our server was nice. No complaints there, just understanding that restaurants get busy!

I ordered an eggs benedict, subbed with normal bacon and hashbrowns. My boyfriend ordered the omelette with bacon and American cheese, hashbrowns and wheat toast (no pictures, sorry).

I am a huge eggs benny fan and I was extremely unimpressed. The english muffin was barely toasted, bacon was chewy, hollandaise was sparse and too lemony. The poached eggs were fine. I had an extremely tough time cutting through the eggs benedict because of the english muffin. It felt lukewarm when I started to eat it, like it had been sitting out for a bit. Usually a place nails at least a couple components for me but I felt like only the poached egg was decent on this one. 

His omelette was quite small for $13 or so, and there was just one piece of toast cut in half. The filling was decent (I tried it and liked it). 

The hashbrowns on both our plates were deliciously crispy on the outside but the inside was mushy and flavorless. There was a big serving of hashbrowns, however we didn't finish them even though we usually really like anything potato related!

We're not picky people (especially my BF) so it's strange for us to leave a place completely disappointed. Maybe we caught an off day?"
72,"Hot Suppa is a great place to settle in for a great meal. 
The menu is authentic and fun. Good contemporary southern cuisine and great service. Staff is helpful and friendly. Setting is cozy and intimate. All in all a great place to have dinner. 

That said, the last time I visited the weather was still winter and the restaurant was incredibly cold. We actually had to eat with our coats on. Not sure how to fix that, but we soldiered through on the strength of the food. 

Definitely check out Hot Suppa. It's worth visiting."
73,"What a tasty spot to grab dinner and a drink! I found this spot through Yelp and the menu sounded great so we made our way over after a walking tour of the downtown. The inside of the restaurant is very cozy. It's just one room with a small bar and less than 10 tables. 

The cocktail menu was very interesting with unique flavors that I don't find in most craft cocktails. I went with a Violet Fizz and unfortunately found it to be too overpowering on the violet and I love the flavor of violet. My husband's Congo Square Zombie was very good. 

We started with Deviled Eggs. Three were bacon and three were sriracha. Both were delicious and we just loved this appetizer. I had the Fried Chicken with Sweet Potatoes as a side. The chicken was so good. The sweet potatoes were yummy too. My husband had the Crispy Catfish Tacos and he loved them."
74,"ATTENTION ALL CANADIANS: Finally, a proper poutine!

- Perfectly crisp, delicious, seasoned fries? Check. 
- Locally-sourced, gooey-chewy cheese curds? Check. 
- Gravy dreams are made of? Check. 

My heart, taste buds and chequing account melted onto the table after the first bite of this sensational dish. A must stop for any Canadian south of the wall. 

Honourable mention: the wings and oysters. 

Mac and Cheese left much to be desired. I've had better expired Kraft Dinner."
75,"The food is fresh, service is quick, cajun Bloody Mary is to die for, and everything is within a reasonable price. Love the decor, paintings on the wall, and overall vibe. Left satisfied."
76,"It looks like 600+ people have already beat me to it, but man, I love this place. The food is amazing, the drinks are pretty tasty and everything about it just screams perfect!

Most people write about the brunch I feel like - it's beyond awesome - but I really love coming here for their dinner. The Hot Chicken is so good. I mean SO. GOOD. But it's definitely HOT! Every time I come here, the food is consistently the best. I also really love their Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese.

Drinks are good - they a good assortment of local beers. They could do better on the cider front. I really enjoy the Porch Swing as well.

The one thing I love about Hot Suppa is that no matter how many reviews they have, I feel like I can always get a table! Keep that up Hot Suppa!!"
77,This is my new spot! Coffee is great. Staff is always on point. Food comes quick and always delicious. I can't think of one thing I'd change! Thanks for being you
78,"I enjoyed my meal and service here. I had the chicken and waffles entree and split the kale and Brussel sprout salad starter. The salad was delicious but the chicken and waffles was pretty average. My boyfriend, who is vegetarian, had the Impossible burger and was happy."
79,"As a foodie, it's hard for me to say this but this place may be one of the best places I've ever had the pleasure of eating breakfast at! I thoroughly enjoyed my eggs benedict special with home fries, waffles and Maine syrup. Utterly delicious! Very friendly staff. Great for kids. And for those of you who enjoy cocktails, you can get them here too! Absolutely 100% eat breakfast at this restaurant - outside if possible!"
80,"Went for breakfast on a weekday and the wait was still 45 minutes, but so worth it! Our waitress was super friendly and her recommendations were spot on. The eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes were so very yummy, with perfectly crispy and soft hash brown. Friend had the corned beef hash with cheesy grits, which she raved about. While I thought the corned beef hash was a bit on the salty side, it went well with the other sides. Decent portions too, we were feeling full for quite a while afterward."
81,"My fianc√© and I stopped in around 7:30 on a Friday night and had no wait for a table outside, which was great. We thought the drinks were creative and quite good. The food was fantastic! We had cornbread, a seafood andouille soup, catfish tacos, and a pork loin sandwich, all excellent. We don't usually stay for dessert, but I'm glad we tried the buttermilk pie with rhubarb compote--so good! 

Our server was great. The only con is that service was a bit slow, so if you're in a hurry you might want to come when you have more time. It's worth it!"
82,"The ""impossible burger"" is perfect. Vegan/vegetarian options and friendly staff!"
83,"Breakfast here was very good, with excellent waffles, bacon, and breads.  The only negative is the price, which is much too high."
84,"Love the happy hour $1 oyster deal! The chargrilled oysters were also quite good and reminds me of the ones I had in New Orleans. The deviled eggs were quite mediocre and not the best I have had, so were the spare ribs. The chicken wings were able really so-so and quite dry.
Becareful with their cocktails, they have a few that are absinthe based, which I forgot tastes strongly like licorice, so I ended up getting a cocktail that I really didn't enjoy but of the taste of licorice. While I didn't try any of their entrees, the appetizers are very mediocre except for their $1 oysters for happy hour"
85,"Woefully disappointed. I could barely cut through my skinny, chewy, over warm lighted or microwaved waffle. The eggs and bacon were under cooked and below mediocre. One of the ""specials"", the pork tacos, looked pretty but had absolutely no flavor. Fortunately, they do have a few plastic bottles of hot sauces on the table. With that said... our waitress was great! We don't recommend this place to anyone. It used to be awesome back in the day, not anymore. For the shameful money we paid we should have gone to Denny's. We hope the owners amp it back up for other patrons in the future."
86,"Quaint little place. The wait time they gave us was pretty long, but it was also a Saturday at 10:30am and we didn't end up waiting very long at all. The food was very good. I got the biscuits and gravy. My only complaint is how heavy they were on the gravy. It was good, I just would have preferred slightly less gravy, or just to have it in the side so I could dip my biscuit in it. My fianc√© loved his meal here, and we both agreed that the food seemed super fresh. The waitress was pretty nice but she seemed sort of stressed out. I definitely recommend this place, and intend on going back."
87,"I'm still thinking about your 3 Egg Scramble 2 months since my trip to Portland! This place was just a 5 minute walk from our airbnb stay, and no doubt, their name popped up first on my search for eats. Bookmarked. Let me tell you, there was already a line for breakfast before they were even opened, on a Thursday morning? 

This little place is small, but theres a mini bar, and beautiful works of art hung throughout for some to admire, and yes, they are for you to purchase.

Creamy.... gooey.... perfectly scrambled eggy eggs! My plate came with scrambled eggs (of course) topped with saut√©ed mushrooms, crispy on the outside -- soft pillowy inside hash, completed with a side of fried green tomatillos. How do you guys cook your eggs?! Hands down best plate of eggs I've had, ever. Take my word for it, get them EGGS."
88,"Changed our breakfast plans after this place was recommended to us by our local friends. We arrived here and only two tables were left in the back. By the time we eat, paid and left... there was a line of about 15 people out the door... That should tell you enough right there.

  My wife and I both loved our breakfast entrees. Very inventive and the taste to back it up"
89,"Even though my friends and I didn't come for supper, Hot Suppa was a great spot for breakfast and friendly service.

At 9 AM on a Saturday, we snagged up a table outside. Each table is shaded with an umbrella, but definitely small - it was just big enough for our food and drinks to fit. 

I ordered one of the specialties - the biscuit and sausage gravy, which came with two buttermilk biscuits and country sausage white gravy, two eggs, and hash browns (you could get Geechie Boy grits or hash browns). The plate had some of my favorite breakfast foods on a plate, so I was really happy with it.

We all enjoyed our food (my friends got the biscuit and sausage gravy, fried green tomato and eggs benedict, and waffle plate) and our server was really nice, but I have definitely had better breakfast food. Nevertheless, it was a great start to our day-trip in Maine.   

By the time we left around 10 AM, we overheard that the wait time for even a two-person table was at least 30 minutes. Hot Suppa is definitely really popular for brunch on weekends, so be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours."
90,Great food and atmosphere. The maple late is was dreams are made of! The service was great even though the restaurant was packed.
91,"Sweet tea brined fried chicken, ribs, maple bourbon glazed sweet potatoes, and house made barbecue sauce stood out during one of the most delicious meals I've had lately. And the chocolate bread pudding was sublime. Excellent service as well. Wish I lived in town just to be a regular!! Will recommend and definitely return on our next trip to Portland. Ohhh that fried chicken..."
92,"Perhaps on of my two favorit breakfast spots. I always get a double order of Biscuits and Gravy (No Eggs) it is delightful. I always use a lot of black pepprer. I have only had something else a couple of times not really a grits fan but did like the Shrimp and Grits, friendly staff I really like it there."
93,"Great food, great prices! It seemed contrary to go to Maine for southern cookin', but well worth it. You can't go wrong with most anything on their food menu. Cons: they need more seating and had an hour wait by 9 in the morning, and their cajun bloody mary was like thin steak sauce. I got heartburn before I got very far into it - they say they can make it less spicy, but it still tastes like drinking steak sauce. We'll definitely return!"
94,"Food: amazing! I got the smoked salmon Benedict, and I swear it was the best Benedict I've had. The eggs were poached, PERFECTLY. The hollandaise sauce was so good. I switched out my hash browns for their grits with cheddar. I ended up taking the cheddar off because it was too salty for my taste, but overall, it was BOMB. I love a good brunch, and this place was great. 

Service: friendly and lovely. 

Tip: We came in around 11 and got sat around 12. I'd recommend walking around and maybe stopping at Local Sprouts for some coffee. 

There's also street parking."
95,"While visiting Portland I knew I wanted to try this place after walking by and reading reviews on Yelp. I was not disappointed. Went for breakfast and enjoyed the waffle with bacon and eggs. The waffle was thinner which I really liked and quite tasty. Our server was very nice and attentive. The host was cool, he may have been the manager, and was also friendly. I only wish I had been in Portland longer to try their dinner."
96,"Came here for their happy hour and $1 Oyster is a really good deal but $1 off drink??! You can do better then that....

Chicken & Waffle: 5/5 OMG OMG OMG!!!! Best Waffle I have EVER had in MY LIFE!!!! I can just eat a whole stack of their waffles. And the fried chicken is crispy and so flavorful~ This is a must have coming here.

Deviled Eggs: 4/5 Both Sriracha & Bacon flavors are really good. The only thing is that the egg din't taste really fresh. You get the tastes that it's been in the fridge for a while...

Hot Cat: 5/5 Spicy version of Shrimp & Grit plus a cat fish. It's well seasoned and not crazy spicy. I would recommend people to try it but definitely go for Chicken & Waffles as top choice

Roasted Cauliflower: 3/5 It's very lightly breaded and I don't know what they put but it's sour??! I just think that it would be a lot better if this is not sour....made it kind of weird tasting

Zombie: 4/5 It's not too sweet yet full of pineapple flavor but I can't really taste the alcohol in it? still I prefer Zombie over Afterglow

Afterglow: 3/5 I like the kick from the jalapeno but the passion fruit juice made the whole drink kind of thick...too little alcohol is the problem I would say

Buttermilk Pie: 4/5 It's light and not too sweet. The crust reminds me of Taiwanese Pineapple cake, which is pretty interesting

I would definitely come back here for breakfast. All I want is their waffle. Really wish we have something like this close by~"
97,"Hot Suppa was amazing for dinner and was the highlight of our last Portland trip. They have some of the most delicious mixed drinks I've had in a while (and I left with quite the buzz). I was worried as a vegetarian I wouldn't find much to eat.  I was so wrong! The siracha deviled eggs were delicious, and I was so happy I convinced my fianc√© to get the pimento bread because it was amazing! I got the fried green tomato salad and roasted cauliflower & Mac and cheese sides (because I'm a Chronic overorderer) as my entree, left stuffed and with a doggie bag. Vegetarians this a great spot!

ETA: I noticed others mentioned a long wait time. We didn't have to wait at all, and there was at least a table or two open. We went during the Winter and I think a weeknight so maybe that's why?"
98,"Visiting from Boston, I have come here numerous times. Always impressed by the staff and the food quality. Definitely worth a visit. One of if not the best brunch place in town. Because of its popularity be weary on a Friday, Sat, Sun morning(s) of wait times."
99,I am not a person who tends to choose southern restaurants. I'm more of an avocado quinoa soy milk type of eater. I found myself at Hot Suppa on a day trip to Portland at the suggestion of my bacon and butter-loving significant other (gotta let him win sometimes) and it was a pure delight. Our server was Evan and he walked us through the brunch menu with suggestions and even some lessons about food sourcing. We shared the fried chicken/biscuit brunch entree and the corned beef and hash. It was all delightful and with just the right amount of grease.
100,"Isa reminds me of a cute brunch spot located in Greenwich Village in New York. If you're not ordering an Eggs Benedict, toast of some sort, or something made solely with eggs, ARE YOU EVEN BRUNCHING?! I ordered the Eggs Benedict, with the addition of lobster (because it's Maine) and I actually asked for the bacon on the side. What I LOVED about Isa's Egg Benedict is that they make their own biscuit, instead of using an English Muffin. It makes the dish SO much better!

I'm usually a Mimosa type of gal, but instead something about Sparkling Lemonade sparked my interest. NO REGRETS. It was so refreshing!!"
101,"Not very impressed for the price. Our seats were cramped and it was extremely loud. Nothing to dampen the noise, and it wasn't even that busy. The music added to the noise because it was too loud. I felt that the service was a little awkward. The table was so small, and I had to move things around multiple times to make room.

The cheese plate was ok; I enjoyed it. The main courses that we got for dinner and the dessert were plain, bland, and uninspired. We spent almost $100 and left thinking that we had wasted our money and wished we had gone elsewhere.

It's not that the place is awful, it's just not worth it for the money and a slightly uncomfortable experience. Based on my experience, it doesn't nearly deserve to be one of the highest rated restaurants in Portland."
102,"What a great experience!  You might have passed isa a hundred times as the building is dwarfed by the Post Office next door and all the turning traffic which might distract you from noticing this little brick building on the corner. 

Let me tell you that isa is far from little on the inside. With parking in the back you can find a space near by and walk in to begin your experience. The space is tastefully done and provides you a space to have an intimate encounter, to small groups or just sit at the bar. 

The staff is friendly and attentive and takes time to explain menu options and always flexible to special requests. Chris, behind the bar, is a wonderful mixologist and if you don't see it on the menu, willing to meet your tastebuds. Love me a rum drink. 

The specials are delicious by taste and description on the menu. The onion soup is so delicious. The options on the menu will be acceptable to most of not all in your party. 

So, the next time you are driving by, take a look at the corner and stop in for a cocktail and lite fare. 

See you there."
103,"Delicious, quality food; great service. We also loved the ambiance. Came for brunch but we hope to come to dinner sometime!"
104,"We had different brunch plans, but the line was too long, so we decided to try Isa on a whim. Boy, am I glad we did! The atmosphere at Isa is definitely trendy/hipster with a flair for steampunk and retro decor, which was fun. Plus, it's a cute, cozy place with about 8 tables and the bar. Overall, an intimate atmosphere. 

The food took a while to get to us, which was rough on my hungover husband. We waited about 40 mins, which is usually longer than I'd like. That said, it was worth it! The eggs Benedict was delicious, and the touch of balsamic on it was unique. The hash browns were perfectly crispy.

My husband got the seasonal gingerbread pancakes, and they were fluffy and delicious. Plus, the coffee kept coming, which was great, and our waiter was fabulous! Can't complain!"
105,Had a lovely dinner there last night. I am always happy when I leave Isa. They are one of Portland's finest....
106,"My first time coming to isa was a couple summers ago when I went for lunch. I was incredibly impressed with the aesthetic of the restaurant. The venue is somewhat smaller, but intimate. It instantly made me think of how it would be the perfect place to go out on a date. They have a small bar with some seating, and when there is nice weather, they have a fenced in outdoor patio space with cafe dangling lights. The restaurant has accents of modern lighting fixtures and has contrasts of black and white between the checkered floor, the black tables and chairs, and the white walls. 

I will say, my first experience with their lunch didn't leave me wanting more. I had ordered a quinoa dish, and while it was okay, the portion was incredibly small and the taste was just ""meh."" I had never planned on really coming back, but I'm super happy that a few months later a friend of mine wanted to come here for dinner. My dinner experience ended up being terrific and I have come numerous times since then for dinner. 

isa's menu has a variety of options, and it changes pretty consistently since they have a farm-sourced menu that changes with the seasons. Their menu is separated by a variety of starters, main dishes, salads, and sides. I have had the chili-rubbed pork chop, the bolognese pasta, a haddock dish, the cheese plate, brussel sprouts, an eggplant quesadilla, bistro steak, and a pasta dish with rabbit. Honestly, all of the dishes that I have had for dinner are incredibly flavorful and are decently portioned. I would recommend any of the dishes that I have ordered here, however the standout for me is the pork chop! If they have it on their menu, GET IT. 

Service is always top notch as well. There is a fine line of being neglected and/or being checked on too much, and the serving staff at isa has really mastered this art. I honestly could go on about the greatness of isa's dinner, but I definitely suggest that you give it a shot!"
107,"With so many new restaurants popping up in Portland, one must always use a critical eye to discern just another trendy tapas joint from a potential new favorite jaunt. All I can say is- Isa definitely delivers!!
The options were all simple, elegant dishes made with seasonal local ingredients. And really, that's all you need to know. You know a place is going to be good when you look at the salad options and think ""wow...I actually WANT to order a salad!"" 

Word to the wise: you can not make a reservation on open table yet as they are not even listed there. However there IS an Isa restaurant in San Francisco that's on opentable. Learn from my mistake- double check the address and if you want a rez at THIS Isa, just pick up the phone and call"
108,"Have since visited a second time and they continue to win me over with their excellent, professional service and fantastic menu. Having dinner here is such a relaxing experience, wish I could live there, lol. Cannot wait to go back again for a third time around the block! :)"
109,The ambiance is beautiful inside isa. I really enjoy the space and the parking is convenient even though it's in less desirable part of Portland. The duck taco was really soft and a great bite. Definitely small and I'd probably want two if you're sharing. The Caesar salad was way too salty almost unpalatable - just needs less of the salt from the cheese or the dressing. The fresh anchovies are a nice touch. The steak and Brussels sprite was just okay. Not the best not the worst. The food to me is a 3 but the ambiance of the restaurant makes up for it. Good for drinks or a nice date night with appetizers.
110,"In a food mecca like Portland, it's hard to find bad food anywhere, but Isa really blew me away. I went here for brunch, and I can't remember the last time I had brunch that wasn't just some variation of standard brunch fare: omelets, egg / crab benedicts, etc. Same ol' stuff, repackaged, slightly changed, good enough, but never anything much to write home about. 

Isa, however... it's been weeks and I'm still savoring the octopus, duck sandwich with a sweet berry chutney, and rabbit hash. All SO incredibly well done. 

8 out of 10 times, chefs seem to overcook octopus, and you're left eating an expensive rubber tire with tentacles, but the octopus here was cooked and slightly charred to perfection. 

The rabbit hash and duck sandwich -- I'm pretty sure I drool about them even in my sleep. Neither were overly complex nor simple, but just the right balance of flavors to make them outstanding. Oddly enough, I landed on Isa only when 90% of restaurants in Portland were closed for that odd time between Sunday brunch and dinner, but fate had me headed to the best brunch this side of Oh Em Gee, so thank you universe ;)."
111,"We came in around 6:00pm and it didn't look that busy since we were able to snag a table for two. We each ordered a bottle of beer since we are not avid wine drinkers and it didn't seem like they had that many choices, which was fine.

I ordered the bistro steak and thought it was cooked the way I like it (medium). My bf ordered the rabbit pasta and was a bit disappointed with the portion. 

We read reviews before coming here and decided to bite the bullet. Unfortunately, service became mediocre. Our waitress took our order first... We waited a little over an hour for our food. There were customers that came in, was seated, and had their orders in after us that received their dinner BEFORE us.

The food is good, but we've had better in Portland. What was mind boggling is that the service became a lot faster when we had to pay our bill and when they saw a semi-large group come in during our dinner."
112,"If someone asked me what my favorite restaurant in Portland, MAINE! is this would be it.

I LOVE the salt cod fritters and order them every time.

Everything on the menu is good.  I have been to many other restaurants in Portland, MAINE! that have reputations that precede them, and typically have had a good time but also have been let down too.

I have not been let down at Ish, my only let down is sometimes the serving size portion is a little small, and I have left there still hungry.

They make some nice cocktales here also.

The wait staff, all very friendly, and they remember me.

5-stars, Best of Portland, MAINE!"
113,"This place is amazing. Top 5 in Portland for sure. 
Drink some cocktails have a caesar salad. 
Sit on the patio, Isaul cooks the best italian food I'm Portland."
114,"What a phenomenal 4 hour meal we had at ISA.  Yes, that's right, I said 4 hour meal.  A few of us went to celebrate a birthday on Saturday and the lucky birthday goer got a LONG celebration.  Four stars alone for not making us feel like a**holes for enjoying our time with each other.  They kept out water and coffee filled.  

But, let's not forget to talk about the food and drink.  The cocktails were on point, with a phenomenal boozy coffee, excellent (but not vegetarian) Bloody Mary, and an AWESOME spicy tequila drink.

My croquet monsieur (I have NO clue if I'm spelling this correctly) was salty and crunchy, a breakfast sandwich lover's delight.  It may have been made to eat with a fork, but I picked that sucker up with my hands and devoured it.  The rest of my party ordered egg sandwiches, French onion soup, and a grilled cheese.  It was smiles all around.

We also had delicious fries with a side of aioli and desserts to top off the 4 hour marathon.  The cheesecake with a walnut glaze was worthy of a Golden Girl night time escapade.  

This place is no All American diner, the prices are high and the atmosphere is modern and clean.  Be prepared to drop some cash for brunch, but you won't leave disappointed.  This place is like brunch heaven... I will be back."
115,"I walked in here expecting to pay too much for an average new American-style brunch. My expectations were completely defied. Was completely blown away by how everything was made in house. Every plate was special. From the biscuits in the eggs Benny, to the braised rabbit hash, to the baked lemon pie, every detail was thoughtfully selected not just for aesthetic, but more importantly for flavor. The perfect brunch for a chilly January day. Can't wait to come back."
116,"You can tell every item on their menu is farm to table. Everything is made in house, healthy, light, and incredible! I got the baked gnocchi and the creamy pesto sauce made the dish outstanding."
117,"This place isa-mazing. Food is always so fresh and consistent. They have an awesome kale and quinoa salad that I've tried to recreate on my own, but always fall short. Seems ill just have to keep going back for it. Also very knowledgeable and friendly bartenders! Clean place, nice vibe. Decent prices... and guess what?!? They have PARKING (limited, but precious)."
118,"Issa was such a great find because the first place we waited for a while was fore st. fore street was packed, had all their garbage displayed on the corner, wanted us to wait an hour and had entrees at $40.  at Issa we instantly got a table in the front window, had hand made pasta, root vegtable salads and the best grilled octopus ever, cooked by the chef owner. beer and wine was all good (I mean, it is Portland)also the place looks like a bon appetit magazine photo spread from top to bottom - and so clean. incredibly we were almost alone by the time we left- the weather was approaching terrible and it was the saturday before Halloween.  i wanted to go to the bar at fore st and tell everyone.

ok. i almost forgot the cake. we got a piece of tres leche milk cake that blew us away. i talked to the owner and its a family recipe. i literally cannot describe how excellent that cake was.  my wife and i were talking about it on the trip back to Albany."
119,"Well done, Isa. You have won the prize for Best Hidden-In-Plain-Sight Gem Of Portland's Brunch Scene (it's a new title, don't worry about it). More on this in a second...

I had been to Isa before for dinner (they hadn't been open very long at that point). The food didn't wow me - it was, in my opinion, overly priced for underwhelming portions of just alright food. The outdoor ""patio"" (for lack of a better term) area, however, did wow me - it felt like I had been transported out of Portland and was nestled away at some known-by-locals-only, hip spot in Brooklyn. The long, narrow alley-way feel with exposed brick on one side, the pots of homegrown cherry tomatoes, the Edison light bulbs above... very, very cool.

I recently came back for brunch. While the inside didn't wow me, this time the food and service did. Arrived at 11am when they opened; stayed until well past 3pm and, long after the bills had been paid and we had outstayed our welcome (though we were *never* made to feel that way!) our water glasses and coffee mugs remained full. They were super considerate about (and even two-steps ahead of us regarding) dietary restrictions. There was no real wait for table. They served food and cocktails off both the lunch and brunch menu until 4pm.

This is EVERYTHING other brunch places in Portland should be doing and are not.

So yes... brunch perfection hidden in plain sight.

The egg sandwich (currently for $8 sans meat) is twice as big as everyone else's sandwich in town. All that scrambled egg, cheddar, and smear of the day (I've seen pesto as an option, I've seen onion jam as an option) on house made focaccia is almost too much, but it's not (no it reallh is, but I don't want Isa to change this bargain breakfast deal, so ignore I wrote that, mmmkay Isa?!). Get a side of hollandaise to dip your sandwich in, skip the home fries (they're a little greasy) and get the perfectly golden fries instead, and enjoy what has to be the best coffee-based alcohol drink in the city: the Boozy Hot Mexican Coffee (no spice here! this baddie is just coffee, tequila, kahlua, cardamom syrup, and cream). Also, get the Hibiscus Margarita while you're indulging. I don't even like tequila, guys. I. Don't. Even. Like. Tequila. But those two drinks are flavorful, balanced, and no less than uhmaaaaahzing.

All in all, having been to Isa during different seasons for different meals, if you can score brunch outside in their pretty little alley... You will love, love, love it. Went a long time ago for dinner and haven't been back? This is one of those places you probably need to try again... for brunch. Or go have brunch elsewhere then come here for second brunch since they're the lone place in town offering it so late in the day!"
120,"My wife and I celebrated our 48th wedding anniversary at Isa this evening. The menu is small but had at least 5 or 6 entr√©es that I would have loved, I ended up ordering the Salt Cod Fritters as an app that we shared, they were crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth creamy inside, the dill tartar sauce that accompanied brought out the flavor of the fritters.I had the Marinated Steak and Fries the steak was tender, juice, flavorful and the sauce was great. The fries were crisp and delicious. My wife had the Tagliatelle Bolognese which she said was very good especially the house made pasta.

This place kills it!!! I will dine here again."
121,"I ate here twice in two days, I would've eaten there three times had they been open. Chris makes excellent cocktails. I especially like the Cider sour. Octopus was good, oil-poached mackerel special was like a baby fish pate. The star for me was a very simple dish, perfectly executed: noodle fin shaved fennel with a very light vinaigrette, pecorino, grapefruit Supremes, apples, and mint. I think I could literally eat the salad every day, beautifully balanced flavors and textures. I wish I knew how they got the sharp anise bite out of the fennel ""noodles"", so mellow. 

Also the braised rabbit hash with eggs the next day was gooey rich and wonderful"
122,"Excellent food. Great drinks. Air conditioned on the day I was there...which was my fav part. It was humid and sticky outside!! The menu is small and would appear to change seasonally! The whole atmosphere was super comfy. I hate crowds, busy restaurants, tight seating, over hearing everyone's conversations but this felt private, comfy and yummy!! The wait staff and bartender was super friendly! They have a small parking area also that is kind of small. 

Cocktails are around $10-$14 
Lunch ranged from $13-$20 

Reasonable for the quality!"
123,"We came to isa for brunch on our last day in town (today), and although we showed up a little late - around noon on a Sunday - we had to wait only a little over 10 minutes before being seated. The restaurant itself is small and cozy, with black lacquered ceiling and old-school lights hanging from the ceiling giving it a retro yet homey vibe. It felt a bit similar to NYC in that there really was not much privacy / space between tables, but that didn't make a huge difference to us. Service was quick, with food coming quickly and water being brought by quickly for refills. The beer menu is mostly local stuff from nearby, although I did encounter a beer (Florens IPA from Austin Street Brewery) that I had not been able to find anywhere else. There are cocktails and a good assortment of other nonalcoholic beverages at brunch as well, but I stuck with my tall can of beer and plenty of water.

The food here was really good, which was a relief after our poor dinner outing the night before at a newer restaurant as well. We started with the cod fritters and the lobster tostada, and while we love the lobster up here and the tostada was pretty good (clean flavors with generous amounts of radish as a garnish, although the corn didn't do much), the fritters was absolutely fantastic. The fry on the fritters was just right - not too heavy - and the chunks of cod were succulent and flaky, and the whole fritter paired excellently with the light tartare sauce spread beneath them. The mains were similarly good, with my only negative comment being that the duck carnitas tacos were already out somehow(?), so I went with the substituted pork version instead - quite solid, but with only 2 tacos and an overdressed side salad clocking in at $14, it felt like a worse value than I would get in NYC. My wife's osso buco stew was very flavorful, though, with the beef cubes being highly tenderized and the tomato broth being infused with lots of herbs and a hint of spice.

Overall, I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food here, and I would love to come back and try other dishes at brunch, as well as see how dinner stacks up. Definitely an enjoyable experience, and one of the places where waiting in line for brunch won't cost you too much time either!"
124,Love this place! Had the cod fritters w/ homemade tarter sauce and eggplant lasagna w/homemade pasta. Both were delicious. Nice lunch/brunch spot. A lot of local produce which I could appreciate. Not many tables so I can see this place filling up quick for dinner. Had cute outside eating area with overhead christmas lights for the warmer months. Only thing was I wish they had was a chicken entree option on the menu!
125,"This is a world class restaurant, and they keep the prices affordable. Huge thank you to the whole team."
126,"Came here for breakfast/brunch. We were seated outdoor. Ordered eggs benedict with lobster, lobster tostada and salt cod fritters. All were very tasty."
127,"Highly recommend! 
Ate here on a Friday evening and enjoyed ourselves! I was nervous about going somewhere that doesn't take reservations on a Friday night, but we were seated right away. 
As a table we ordered the olives, French fries, heirloom tomato salad, grilled octopus, the lamb, the rabbit, the pork chop, and the steak. 
The olives were fine, they were olives. 
The French fries were kinda sad. Some were good and crisp and some were no good and soggy and oily. I don't recommend those. 
The heirloom tomato salad was stupid good - I wish we ordered two. 
The grilled octopus was absolutely delicious, but less of a portion than we expected. 
The lamb and rabbit dishes were both great and the individuals at our table who ordered them raved and raved about them. I tried bites and thought they were yummy! 
My husband got the pork chop and felt it was a little dry and needed more of the pineapple flavor. 
I got the chimichurri steak with greens - the flavor was great. I ordered it med-rare and it came in ever so slightly under, but not enough to send back. Our waitress offered to have it refired for me and I declined because it was so close that I was very happy with most of it. And it meant my husband got extra bites - so he was happy too.   
We got the tres leches cake for dessert and it was delicious and the perfect end to the meal."
128,"Isa is a super cute little restaurant with some really delicious food. We went here a couple weeks ago to try out a new place for dinner.

We arrived at about 8PM for dinner and were the only group waiting for a table, which was good as there is not much waiting room inside. The hostess was very kind and offered us some drinks while we waited. She personally took our orders and brought us our drinks.

The interior was very elegant. It is on the smaller side, however this creates a very cozy intimate feel. It is in a beautiful brick building which provides a nice touch of rustic charm. The d√©cor is also very calming and tasteful which just makes you feel relaxed and able to enjoy your experience.

We were quickly seated as soon as there was a table available for us. We were greeted by our server and offered some water.

The menu was great and offered some great options that you probably wouldn't see at every restaurant.

We started out with some of fries and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious. They had a wonderful glaze and were served with some bacon.... Yum!

For my meal, I decided on the braised local rabbit which is something that I had never tried before...... or even thought about trying for that matter! But, boy am I glad that I did. This was absolutely delicious. The rabbit was served with garganelli and English peas. The flavor was simply amazing.

Other meals at the table included the marinated bistro steak and the grilled pork chop. I was able to have bites of both of these and they were also delicious. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent.

The service throughout our meal was excellent and very consistent. We were appropriately taken care of without feeling like we were being hounded.

This was a wonderful place, and I will definitely be returning."
129,"Our kids relocated to Portland and we were looking for a great place for a birthday dinner. These Philly food fanatics loved Isa! 
Located on a corner in a very nice brick building, this small dining room with bar looked welcoming and the porch outside was perfect. All the ingredients were local and superb, the cooking was creative and really well executed. They even had a homemade rhubarb/something non alcoholic soda for my wife and preggers daughter. We did not get to try dessert as dusk hit and the girls were getting buzzed by mosquitoes (not the fault of Isa!). The owners will get consistent five star reviews once they can maintain a waitstaff this place deserves. 
Lobster tostado, asparagus, short ribs, eggplant lasagna, pork chop, gnocchi and a salad(forgot which one) for the four of us. 
And of course we found Isa on Yelp-thanks to those reviewers whose opinions resonated with us."
130,"Most of the time we like to try different restaurants everytime we go to Portland, but this time, we visited Isa for the second time. The first time was so memorable that we kept wanting to go back and make sure it wasn't a fluke. I don't often have octopus, but the last time we were there, we got that dish and it was the best octopus I had ever eaten.

This time we started with the happy hour taquitos for $5. They had potato and cheese and a delicious romesco on top. You can tell they were homemade and at 3 to an order, it was quite a deal. Nice and crispy with manchego cheese lightly dusted on top.

Next, we had salt cod fritter was dill pickle tartar dipping sauce. I have had many cod fritters in the past, so my mind was expecting one thing and my pallet got an entirely different experience. These salt cod fritters were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The texture was like a really soft crab cake, which made me believe they were freshly made. The sauce was a excellent compliment along with the spritz of lemon completed the dish.

We really enjoy getting one thing at a time. One, because it prolongs the dining experience allowing us to take in the atmosphere and service. Also, we like to get a taste of the food before really committing to a full meal. Many times, people order way too much and just guzzle it down without enjoying.

The last thing we got was the eggplant lasagna - housemade pasta, ricotta, and tarragon. This dish was also excellent! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the eggplant was sliced to mimic the pasta sheets. On top was a delicious helping of ricotta they make in-house. You can tell time, love, and care went into this dish. And it was drizzled with an excellent olive oil.

Isa is a beautiful restaurant that is neat and clean and makes you feel very comfortable. The food and service are both outstanding, making for a pleasurable dining experience. We will definitely be back."
131,"This place blew our socks off! The food was amazing the service was impeccable and sitting out on the patio in the warm summer evening air made for a very romantic dinner. The wait for food was a tad longer then the waiter thought was ok, though we were not bothered at all by it and he curtiously comped off my drink. I'd give them 10 stars if I could!"
132,"I came solo and enjoyed a fantastic, delicate and flavorful hash of the day: pulled lamb. 

I was skeptical at first. I don't wake up thinking ""ok yep time for pulled lamb."" But the dish really won me over. 

And their house made sodas-- unique flavor combinations, not overly sweet, really impressive. 

Not to be missed for brunch."
133,"Had a fabulous time here last Monday evening  with my best friend :-)
Wonderful city, wonderful food, superb art museum, and this was an amazing meal.  She loved the oysters and I loved the heirloom tomato salad,  and the burrata and arugula salad.
Would definitely frequent this restaurant if I lived here"
134,"Delightful neighborhood bistro that does everything right.  If it was anywhere else, isa would probably be one of the hottest restaurants in town, but Portland is so restaurant-rich and isa is a bit off the beaten path that you might actually get a table here if everything downtown is busy.  The food uses a variety of influences, but is fairly straightforward.  Expect a pasta, salads, a few fancier dishes with some seafood, and apps like roasted brussels sprouts with bacon.  Nothing particularly inventive, but the execution is superb.  Get the fries, they are outstanding.  Prices are fairly reasonable too.  I'd be here all the time if I lived in Portland."
135,"We went there during our Portland trip. Like many small restaurants, the lunch menu was short but every dish we ordered was good. I can tell the chef has put a lot of thoughts into every dish. I would rather having a small menu with every dish is good and thoughtful than having a menu like a phone book with mediocre quality. I do agree with a review saying the service was ""missing something"". The waiter seemed and sounded cold. However, it didn't affect the star rating in this case. We ordered salt cod fritters, octopus salad, lobster tacos, tuna sandwich and pork sandwich. 

Salt cod fritters was crispy outside and soft inside and the aioli brought the fritters to another level. Octopus salad ""wow"" me. I made salad and salad dressing almost everyday. I constantly looking for salad ideas. This salad was very refreshing with lemon aroma but not overly sour taste. Lobster tacos was an interesting twist of lobster roll. I will visit again next time when I am in Portland."
136,"The neighborhood wasn't the best, but definitely worth the walk! We started off with the duck carnitas and it was phenomenal! It had a little spicy sauce that went so well with the tender shredded duck. We got the steak and the bolognese and both were amazing! We also got cocktails and those were delicious as well. The atmosphere in the restaurant was perfect for a date night. Definitely a must try!"
137,"One of my first meals in Portland and probably one of my favorites.

A few blocks from Congress street, I happened upon isa in passing.  The interior is low-key but sophisticated, a simple setup that gives a feeling of an intimate dining atmosphere.  I came at an odd hour between lunch and dinner, so I can't really say how busy the place gets.  But for me at least, it was a laid-back meal.

To start with I ordered the panzanella which was quite refreshing.  The cucumbers were juicy and the bread soaked in the basil vinaigrette really enhanced the flavor.  Very delicious.  For the entree I tried the eggplant lasagna.  Lasagna is usually such a coin toss at restaurants, because they can often end up being too heavy a dish.  Instead it was light and airy, the ricotta not being too overpowering like in certain places.  The cuts of eggplant within its folds was a nice touch.  

It was a light meal that hit all the marks.  isa promotes their choice of using locally-sourced fresh ingredients and it shows.  They have a fan in me and I would definitely come back again."
138,"Amazing food and service!! We ate here two nights in a row, menu is small but diverse...want to try everything.
In love with burrata salad, octopus was excellent and braised lamb w lemon parpadalle...delish! My husband has allergies and they were super accommodating. Get off the beaten path in Portland and check out this beautiful gem!"
139,We loved it ...try the halibut it is superb!  Yes we had a bottle of wine but that was between 3 of us ... the halibut with lobster sauce is outstanding !! It is a small place and at first I thought what did I get us into but it's Farm to plate and it is fresh and fantastic !  Oh and try the octopus it's so tender not chewy ...yum!
140,"Of all of the restaurants in Portland, Isa is one of the most underrated.  It is always on my list when I am in the city because of the warm atmosphere and excellent food.

Portland tends to be on the pricey side when it comes to dining, yet Isa is an exceptional value.  Dinner here seems to be about a quarter of the price of other places in the city, and the quality is just as high.  Perhaps it is because the neighborhood isn't as charming as the Old Port.

The menu is somewhat small, but extremely varied, and everyone should be able to find something that suits them.  There are always a few homemade pasta dishes, several seasonal seafood options, and some elegant meat preparations.  You can't go wrong, but I am a big fan of their pasta dishes in particular.

This is a great neighborhood establishment, and I recommend trying it out soon!"
141,"Came on a Saturday and was seated right away. The patio outside looked really cozy and cute but it was a bit too chilly that evening so we opted for inside. 
The eggplant lasagna was divine. Fresh and flavorful, but not too heavy. Corn and salt cod fritters were pretty good. I got the Tea Coupe (hibiscus infused tequila) from the bar and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Tequila-based drinks are usually very tequila-forward, but this one did well in that other flavors were able to stand out. 
Overall service was friendly and attentive, and I would definitely come back for the lasagna!
It's a little drive from the main downtown area, but they have a parking lot right outside."
142,"What a cute spot! We ended up getting in line before they opened, which allowed us to get a seat quickly, as the place is rather tiny and wait times certainly creep up! The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the food was spectacular! Will be back to try the other entrees, as the croque madame was delicious but everything else looked amazing as well!"
143,"Food was excellent. Salted cod was very good. Lobster tacos were small but filled with meat. The portion was perfect. Lamb sandwich was worth the trip. Small beer list but good options. Chocolate cake, don't remember actual name, was awesome. Can't wait to return."
144,"Such a gem! Never disappoints. Drinks to wine to apps then dinner and dessert - absolutely one of the best spots in Portland. Keep doing what you're doing, Isa."
145,Amazing food and reasonable portions. Everything is sourced locally and very fresh. Delicious eggplant lasagna and octopus taco.
146,Driving back to Boston we made a stop here and the food was light yet really satisfying. Off the beaten old town. Worth the stop.
147,"Wow wow wow. I went to Isa on a busy Friday night to celebrate a friend's birthday and was IN AWE by the heartiness and deliciousness of the food. My friends ordered a vegetable lasagna and a Bolognese, and I ordered a pork chop served over polenta. We got these juicy, flavorful shisito peppers to start. The service was impeccable. Though the check was a little more than I'd like to pay, for the quality of the restaurant and service, it was worth it."
148,"Are you hungry? Do you like delicious food? Here's a tip...stop reading and head to Isa Bistro. You can read the rest of this once you're sipping on a fantastic drink, waiting for your meal to come.

Have you ordered yet? Great. Here's the rest of my review...

Isa is the total package. They offer terrific service, fresh, seasonal food, and some of the most interesting and surprising (all in a good way) flavors that I've ever had. Do you like rhubarb? How about mustard seed? Ok, now picture a pleasant combo of both of those on fire-grilled asparagus with some shaved pecorino. Having trouble picturing it? Well, good thing you're already there...just order some and see for yourself!

The drinks were pricey ($12 for my Rosemary Gimlet) but were absolutely fantastic and trust me...you only need one! It was refreshing, and came loaded with local Bimini Gin.  A real treat. My husband had the Isa Sidecar and it was soft and fruity. 

We tried the arugula salad with rhubarb mustardo and burrata - wow. Light, flavorful, and lots of burrata. The spring gnocchi were soft, pillowy perfection, in a heavenly sauce. The meal was so delicious that we felt like we'd be doing ourselves a serious disservice to skip dessert, so we went for the server's recommendation and split a piece of the tres leches‚Äã with candied orange peel. It was a showstopper. The server mentioned that it's their signature dessert and that it's never come off the menu...I pray that it never comes off. It was moist, light, not overly sweet, and the best way to end such a fabulous meal.

The atmosphere is upscale yet cozy...Isa has a classy vibe, but is not a place where you feel underdressed or uncomfortable. The staff is warm and really knows their stuff! We didn't have to ask for a thing while we were there, and felt completely cared for the whole time. Excellent customer service can be tough to find, but these folks have it down to a science.

I'm already planning my next visit. Isa, you've got a new fan!"
149,"Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend , no reservations , and was seated right away in the outside area. The outside area is beautiful. It was hot out that day but it had a nice breeze and was shaded.

To start we had the Lobster chowder and the salt cod fritters. Both were Delicious !! 

For dinner we both had the Gulf of Maine Sole. It came with spinach and some kind of delicious potatoes. The fish was delicious and light , it just melts in your mouth.

We somehow found room for their brownie with sea salt ice cream on top and come kind of cherry reduction. This s**t was amazing !! 

My 1 and only complaint would be that I felt they took a long time to actually take our order. But other than that, everything was perfect!"
150,"We have been traveling the past 6 days from Newport, RI to Portland, ME and our dinner tonight at ISA was by far the best one.  The chefs, cooks, and bakers at ISA know what they are doing!   The meal was excellent; the portions were appropriate, and the prices were reasonable.  The servers were very polite.  You won't be disappointed visiting this restaurant."
151,"Traveling from mini vacation in north inland Maine back to Philly with travel buddies going on to San Diego. We stopped here by chance, on way to airport. What a great surprise. Food was very good and so were the bloody Mary's (must try -have unique twist). Great comfort food with modern updates. Staff was very personable and friendly. Try the grilled cheese and soup - you will not be disappointed.  
Two Yankees and a Midwesterner"
152,"BRUNCH REVIEW:

Loved it! Such a comfortable place.

Came with a party of 6 on a Saturday morning as they were they only place that would take a brunch reservation on a Saturday. We reserved a table right at 11am when they open and within 20 minutes, the place was packed. Service was excellent!

I had a bloody mary which was deliciously spicy, and fresh, hot coffee. To eat; the egg sandwich on a biscuit with pesto. Perfectly cooked eggs and very well balanced. 

We'll be back!"
153,"My partner and I went to isa on Saturday night and were seated right away which was a pleasant surprise from what we were expecting. 

When we sat down we were immediately greeted by the waiter who was very friendly and helpful throughout the evening. I would say the service was superior throughout the night as we never had to worry about running out of anything and were given recommendations on the menu. 

The ambience of the restaurant was very nice for a date night. It was a quiet dinner but the music was very nice playing in the background. Restaurant seemed to be very clean and tidy, especially the kitchen which was great to see. 

I ordered the meatballs with marinara for a starter and the meatballs were cooked very well and the sauce added a great flavor to the dish. For the main dish I went with the tagliatelle bolognese. It was also cooked to perfection and made for a great main course. 

Overall isa was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back to try to other items on the menu I haven't had a chance to try yet."
154,Went for dinner and drinks on a Thursday night.  Very nice patio with a relaxed vibe.  Quality of food is competitive with some of the more expensive Portland restaurants.  Memorable Bolognese and fresh made pasta.  Highly recommended.
155,"The haddock ceasar was perfect! It was cooked fresh to order, the sear was beautiful on the haddock, and all in all I am so delighted I stopped in and gave this place a chance."
156,"Pre Cascobaylines ferry  to Long island Maine stopped in here as cafe across street too busy. Are we glad we did. Outstanding flavors. Braised rabbit hash with fried eggs. Gourmet grilled cheese. Lobster tosada , and baked egg marinara w kale and pecorino. Bloody Mary's. Yum. And grilled focaccia bread. Super friendly staff that helped my 93 yo parents who wolfed down everything."
157,"Impressed by the quality and quantity of their food.  After attempting to find a restaurant during the popular Sunday brunch hour of 11 am, we stumbled across Isa.  My husband ate their lamb sandwich, stating it was a special experience.  The table next to us wanted to know what he was eating because of the blissful face he made while eating.  We combined their brunch and lunch menu; it was a delightful combination.  

Get their foccacia egg scramble!  Yum. 

I want to thank our server Juleah, who was fantastic.  Great brunch option that while  crowded still had seats available."
158,"This restaurant is awesome! The food is fresh and tasty. Without any doubt, this is my recommendation for a good meal in a nice place!"
159,"Do not pass the duck liver mousse, exceptional!! The drinks are homemade, and the food is farm to table! I highly recommend Isa!"
160,"My husband and I loved everything about the dinner we just had here.

Service was phenomenal. Very attentive and a pleasant attitude/smile with every check in.

Seriously some of the best food I have ever eaten. Not just for Portland, but my entire 33 years walking this Earth! 

Lamb meatballs were the most tender meatballs I've ever had. We were unsure what to expect of the green sauce versus a red, but it was ooooooh so creamy and delicious!

The cod fritters were equally amazing, served with a thick smear of tartar sauce. Fried to perfection!

My husband got the rabbit pasta with peas. We are sad to eat a bunny, but at least it was f-ing yummy. Just how I picture bugs bunny tasting after sitting in a cauldron full of carrots.

I ordered bolognese, and was blown away! I'm a huge bolognese fan, and never expected this to be the best I've ever eaten!

We ordered desserts, even though being quite full. We didn't dare pass up another amazing course even if we had to unbutton our pants to make room.

This is a MUST if you are visiting Portland. Don't be dismayed by the slightly disheveled neighborhood. It was still safer than a lot of streets in Boston/Cambridge MA in my opinion. Plus Bubba's Sulky Lounge is across the street."
161,"We just came here for the first time today and we were quite impressed. 

The decor was tasteful and hip, the service was friendly and the food was very good. 

We didn't get to try a lot of the menu because we were there for a light lunch, but what we had was fantastic. The dishes were actually fairly simple but very flavorful which speaks to both the quality of the ingredients and the skills of the people preparing it. 

We were very impressed and will be back very soon."
162,"This was a great find after a visit to the Portland Museum of Art. It wasn't crowded, there's a little parking in the back and it's relaxing and bright inside. We were there for a late lunch on a holiday Monday and were seated promptly.
I loved everything I was served. The salt cod fritters with fresh house tartar were delicious and the guajillo sauce for the fries was also good.
I followed it with the eggplant lasagna which was pretty exceptional - fresh pasta, fresh ricotta, perfectly cooked eggplant and a drizzle of EVVO. 
Finished with a delicious house-made coconut pie with a chocolate ganache between the coconut shortbread crust and the coconut cream. 
The service was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.
We will be back!"
163,"Quaint off the tourist track.  Fun lunch. Excellent Osso buck stew, and salads were also very good. Eclectic wine list. As others have pointed out, while walkable you go by a few iffy blocks with transient people loitering. Better to take Uber."
164,"There are some things I really like about Isa: the ambiance is nice; it's more casual and less expensive than the nearby Back Bay Grill, and yet it's a nice spot for a date. It's warm and cozy, it's fancier fare than pub food, they bring out the (delicious) pre-meal bread. Beer and wine selections are limited but ""refined"", reservations aren't often required. I used to have this at the top of my list for date-night spots for friends visiting Portland.

I probably only visit myself maybe once every couple months, and the menu never seemed to change much. This is fine, but if there's only a couple things on the menu that you're really interested in eating, you want them to be near excellent every time. And one would think that the kitchen, only preparing these certain dishes repeatedly, would also have them down to a science. 

A visit a few months back led me to the bistro steak, as I'm not a big seafood person (a sacrilege in Maine, I know) and wasn't feeling rabbit or pasta. It wasn't very memorable but my girlfriend enjoyed whatever it was that she had. On a more recent visit, I went specifically for the steak (and the atmosphere) and m'lady had the pan-seared Bluefish. I ordered the steak medium-rare, and the nice guy serving us said that temp back to me, and yet when it arrived it was much closer to ""well"" with just a hint of pink in there and somewhat tough which is always a bummer to someone wanting a bloody steak. If nothing else, I just wanted a steak to taste better than I cook at home, which isn't a very high bar. Sadly, my girlfriend commented on how dry and overcooked her bluefish was before I even commented on mine, the only moisture coming from the accoutrement. 

I have no doubt they would have fixed both of these issues without much annoyance, but when you've had a long day and just want to relax and have a nice date, you don't really want to sit through the awkwardness and time of sending things back, which is where we were at. The lamb meatballs we had to start were divine, so I suppose it's just a matter of ordering the right thing on any given night.

We'll probably still stop by for a drink and a snack on occasion, but I don't think I'll be dropping $25-ish on any other entrees in the near future."
165,"Pleasant surprise!! We were looking for brunch and ran into Isa by accident. Great staff, good drinks.  Is small cozy & menu and food are amazing."
166,"My husband and I got lunch here and it was amazing. We sat at the bar and the bartender was fantastic, extremely helpful and nice. The breakfast sandwich was delicious, and my husband got the lobster tacos which he loved. The drinks were also really well constructed and not overly sweet."
167,We came here for brunch since the place across the street had an hour and a half wait. We were seated right away and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious drinks and great food. My husband and I both had the eggs Benedict and we loved it. Would definitely recommend!!
168,"Went here for lunch on Presidents Day and cannot wait to go back and try their dinner! Everything on the menu looked delicious and everyone was happy with the food. Only complaint is that it was $12 for a hibiscus tequila drink served in a small glass, which seemed over priced. Appears they use local vendors as often as possible.
Waiter was friendly and helpful with providing recommendations. 
Got two salads and the octopus to start. The kale and quinoa salad was fantastic. For entrees there was a hash special, rabbit pot pie and beef bolognese. Everyone had a different favorite but all delicious. 
Wide variety of teas. Tres leches cake was a generous slice of cake, which made splitting between 4 people easy.
Will definitely be back!"
169,"Great new American cuisine in Portland, Maine. Excellent steak! Sat at the bar which was lovely and we were seated right away on a Saturday evening without reservations even though the place was full. Also recommend the chocolate cake for dessert."
170,What a wonderful experience. Ambiance is wonderful. Service is tops. And the food... killer!  Can't wait to go back again.
171,"I loved this place. they have great beers and a good bar. It is a cozy place that brightens up a drab neighborhood. I had 3 appetizers for my dinner. Hubby had the marinated bistro steak wi potatoes. He didn't see the potatoes part so he ordered fries. They were good. His steak was, as he put it ""acceptably chewy"" But tasted good. I had 3 perfect sized meatballs, a beet and avocado salad and grilled peaches and feta. YUMMY!
I actually had dessert too. I had chocolate spice cake with marshmallow ice cream. It was good, but dont be fooled, the spice cake is SUPER SPICY, so dont eat your ice cream first, eat it WITH the cake.  I also had a fabulous cup of tea that was local and delicious. 
I would so go back here!!"
172,"Isa gets the first Yelp restaurant review I've ever written. It's that amazing. They've figured out a level of perfection here that I've only seen at a few places, and they do it for a reasonable price. 

Across two brunches there I've had consistently incredible seasonal food (recommend their slow cooked meats), the most friendly service, and ambience is excellent as well.

If I lived in Portland I would go to Isa all the time."
173,"Although it's in an ""up and one day coming"" part of west Portland, be careful not to walk down Preble Street: dozens of homeless, some screaming, waiting for services at the shelter/resource center.  

Once you walk in, you find yourself in a cozy, casual bistro-style restaurant, with friendly servers and a creative menu.  We started with an incredible shaved fennel salad with grapefruit and pecorino cheese.  It was clean and fresh with a super light flavor profile.
The corn tortillas with corn masa and a red pepper sauce bed was a sleeper hit; sublime light red sauce with crispy filled tortillas.  Terrific texture and just the right portion size.  

Next for main (lunch) courses: Eggplant lasagna, which was well made and super tasty, if a touch oily, with a perfect egg-shaped ball of ricotta on top.  The baked eggs (they did it with egg whites for us) with grilled kale, tomatoes, and a piece of grilled, thick wheat bread was a huge portion and chock full of grilled, smoky tastiness.  Both were delicious!  Overall, this is a fun, casual, modern take on an American bistro."
174,Great place for brunch and lunch. My friend had the lobster taco and she loved it!!! It was not rubbery. Lobster was well cooked and the dressing for the salad was really good. I had the pork panini. It was not salty at well and really good.
175,"This place would have received a 5. However. The service was missing something.  So. We need to go to a 4.  

What could not have been better. The taste of the pork chop, the grilled peaches, lobster tostado, and the grilled octopus.  Oh yea.  Key lime pie with coconut crust,  yes!  A 10!   

The tagliatelle, the vegetable pasta, and the meat balls were good but unremarkable.  So. Not bad, 

The service was lacking.  We waited a long time for our cocktails and our appetizer.  It was not that crowded.  

Would definitely come back, and would want the owners to just tweak things to be the next level.  
Wine should always be on the table prior to entrees. This is what got us in other restaurants.  

We ordered in time.  Just had to wait after the main course was served."
176,"The food and service was absolutely outstanding. We had a chance to eat outside and had a few drinks before dinner. Try both tequila drinks before getting started. 

The vegetables are clearly locally sourced and fresh. We loved every moment of our experience. Definitely worthwhile"
177,"What an amazing restaurant!  I was blown away with the service and the food.  The Lobster Eggs Benedict was the best I've ever had, and their Bloody Mary's were great too.  We were looking for a place to eat and everywhere had a very long wait.  We found this place off the beaten path, and we were so glad that we did.  The restaurant was one of the cleanest I have ever seen, and the decor was perfect.  We loved how the kitchen had a nice big window by the bar.  Everyone there was extremely friendly.  This was one of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant, and my new favorite place in Portland.  If you are looking for a great brunch place with little to no wait then this is your spot.  Do yourself a favor and visit ISA next time you are in Portland.  You won't regret it!"
178,"Man oh man, that housemade tagliatelle is perfection. I'd sleep on a pillow made out of it! Ok maybe not, but it's the perfect bed for their bolognese sauce. Or their braised local rabbit. Or anything else they're serving it with. 

On a cold, rainy Friday night, my party of 3 waltzed in without a reservation. The cozy, dimly lit space was neither empty nor packed, and we were seated right away by the front window. A round of drinks and our order placed - the two aforementioned dishes plus one of the specials. To my surprise, all three were served with the same pasta - the menu hadn't specified. I'm normally big on sharing, but we all got a bit territorial with our meals (because they were so delicious) and we didn't even exchange bite for bite. As tempting as the others looked, I was perfectly content cleaning my plate and only mine. The others followed suit. You might think that polishing off an entire bowl of pasta would leave you feeling overstuffed and weighed down. On the contrary! The portions were just right and the pasta not too heavy that we were full without feeling uncomfortable. Exactly how I want to end a meal :) 

The whole experience was really positive and left me wanting to return on another visit to Portland. At isa you'll feel like a local since it's off the beaten path, far enough away from the tourist-heavy Old Port that you can actually enjoy some peace and quiet - and a great meal."
179,"Had the cod fritters and grilled octapus, then tres leche cake for dessert. I want to preface this a little: I'm pretty sensitive to salt and sugar because I grow up eating food with minimum salt and sugar. Cod fritters were amazing, creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. There was a lot of cod meat in them. Octopus is not so good. I was looking for fresh out of the water octopus considering it's Portland, but instead, it was mushy and salty. It's not bad, but it's just not how octopus is supposed to taste like. Tres Leches is pretty good, until it got too sweet at the end. I love how they update their menu according to what's fresh, but I was looking forward to the lamb sandwich which was not available today. All in all, this is a good restaurant, but not everything on the menu is good."
180,Consistently good food. I have gone there several times and you only go back in Portland if it's good because there are so many choices. And I'm partial to the coconut cream pie. And the octopus
181,"Isa is an amazing little gem in Portland. I came here with my girlfriend over July 4th weekend and we ordered the scallop and sole ceviche, braised local rabbit and gulf of Maine sole. 

The ceviche had a great balance between the saltiness and citrusness and the tortilla chips were thick and crispy, though I wish the portion was a bit larger.

I had never had rabbit before and wasn't sure what to expect, but the dish ended up being fantastic! The rabbit meat was very tender and the sauce was quite flavorful, perhaps a bit on the salty side. The garganelli pasta had great texture, having the right amount of chewiness. My gf's sole was likewise very tasty. The sole was very tender and the caper butter sauce was great as well.

Dessert was cherry cheesecake; the cherries were super fresh and sweet. Isa also has great cocktails. I ordered the cucumber caipirinha (a Brazilian drink), and it was refreshing and delicious. The service is also very good and our waitress was super sweet and attentive. Will definitely be back next time!"
182,"This was my second visit to Isa.  This time I was with a party of four for brunch, last time I sat out on the summer patio with a friend.
My first visit to Isa was ok.  The food was good, but I thought the amount of food for the amount of money charged seemed off balance.  SO I stayed away for a long, long time.
This past Sunday, I was looking for a place in town that was still serving brunch after 3.  Most brunch places in town stop serving at 3, which I find kind of ridiculous.  I think Portland should move to a NYC brunch schedule and serve until 6.  Ok, how about a compromise and serve until 4????
The great news is Isa DOES serve brunch until 4, so there we were at 3 walking in, with plenty of available tables.
My husband and I both ordered brunch cocktails.  Mine involved hibiscus tea and I enjoyed it very much, although I did think it was a small amount for a $10 cocktail.  My husband got something with bourbon, which looked more generous.
For food we got:
Starters for the table:
Codfish fritters-Very tasty and fresh with a house made tartar sauce, small serving
Fries with aioli-I tend to like my fries browner (personal preference)-solid overall
Eggs Benedict-Nice job with this classic.  Served on a biscuit and came with home fries and a green salad 
Roasted lamb hash-Nice mix of lamb and root vegetables, two sunny side eggs on top.  Kind of a small serving.
Croque Monsieur-Loved it, high praise
A braised pork and pineapple sandwich-Good reviews

We were not going to get dessert, BUT decided to have a look at the menu and picked a coconut cream pie and a brownie with nutella ice cream to share.  They also serve tandem coffee (highly recommended).  The desserts were actually spectacular, especially the coconut cream pie.  I liked that so much, I might place it in my ""worth a special trip"" category.

Overall, I would suggest Isa, if you are in town and looking for brunch.  The only reason for four stars, instead of 5 is that this town has a STRONG brunch game and the competition is abundant and stellar.  
On the other hand, if you have a very hungry crowd (meaning more generous portions) and want a nicer sit down brunch, I might suggest Outliers, Abilene or the Frog and Turtle in Westbrook.  There are others, but these three are consistently solid, have a nice atmosphere and are not generally so packed that you can't get a table."
183,"Wonderful food - ingredients, flavors, presentation - in a lovely but casual environment. The pork chop and gnocchi were the stand-outs, but everything tasted great!"
184,"Two opinions here.  Mine and my dining partner.  I liked the octopus and the fennel salad and loved the rabbit.  I did not like the ceviche.  My partner liked all three appetizers, but did not enjoy his pasta with lamb as the lamb was overcooked.  I agreed with his later point.  But what spoiled it for me was the service.  While it was efficient, our waitress was unfriendly.  She never smiled.  When we left, the place had four other diners, so it was not like the staff was busy.  No one said ""thank you"" or ""goodbye.""  For a neighborhood place, Isa was unwelcoming."
185,"Shot story: GO!  Try the food, it's really great!

For a more in depth review:  

My friends and I started outlet own brunch club and this was the inaugural spot.  The servers were super friendly and sat us right away even though two members of our party had not yet arrived.  The server we had was super friendly but also knowledgeable.  She specifically asked if anyone had allergies or sensitivities, which I really liked.  


The atmosphere was great.  Isa is definitely smaller, however they clearly do attempt to accommodate everyone as there was a larger party of ten in the restaurant.  The space is a bit noisy, due to the acoustics, but it is well decorated and definitely clean.  I can see it getting quite crowded but the space seems pretty modular.  There is an outdoor patio (it was too cold for it sadly) and they have a small but well kept row of parking spaces (maybe seven or eight cars worth) in the back. 

My food was delicious.  I had the croque madam and the French onion soup.  It was well prepared. My only issue with this restaurant, and the reason it gets four stars instead of five is that it took a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen.  Think 25 minutes for the soup and over 45 minutes for the entrees.  While I definitely get that everything is from scratch, if we were super hungry or in a rush this would be a problem.  I would personally rather have the food take longer and be delicious, but this is an important planning factor and it was long enough that I couldn't NOT mention it.  

Overall, I'm sure I will be back and it is definitely worth a visit."
186,"Isa is our go-to place for both casual and special occasions.  The food is consistently well-prepared, delicious, and impeccably timed.  Our servers have always been delightfully friendly and professional.  The restaurant itself is quaint and charming in its ambience.  Isa rivals the best restaurants in town, without the exorbitant prices and pretensions.   Last note - stay for the tres leches cake!"
187,"Great new spot! They have been open only a month,but are already running smoothly. As others have mentioned the crew working here are a warm and welcoming bunch, and the space itself is well laid out with a bistro vibe. 

On this our first visit, we stopped in for their very first day serving brunch. We are really glad we did as the food was very,very good. 

I started by trying the lamb sliders, which consisted of spicy lamb sausage, pickled  red peppers and goat cheese served on focaccia. Mmmm,Mmmm Yum and large living in the land of small plates I will add enough to share with several people (I of course, devoured the whole thing)! I particularly enjoyed  the light and fluffy goat cheese, It had the most wonderful consistence like it had been whipped. In any case the cheese and sausage made a super yummy flavor bomb when combined with the lamb sausage.
Next up was the croque Madame, layers of crisp Standard Bakery bread, covered with prosciutto and melted Swiss, then topped with a beautiful fried farm egg. So good, so very very good! 

My wife had the baked eggs and they were very good too. Super rich and creamy balanced nicely  by the tangy tomatoes and kale. 
Overall, a very good showing from this brand new restaurant. As they continue to settle in, I look forward to seeing how their brunch/cocktail menus expand/evolve.

Next time we will have to try dinner!"
188,"Visiting Portland for the day (we are from New York and RI).  Just had dinner at Isa and it was terrific. Best items were Salt Cod Fritters, Shaved Fennel Salad, and Pan Seared Haddock. All dishes were flavorful and well prepared. Rhubarb and gin cocktail was yummy too.  Definitely recommend!!"
189,"This has become one of our go to restaurants.  Food is consistently well prepared and fresh, service is excellent, menu offers both small and entree sized plates, and cocktails are well crafted.   We've sampled most of their menu and never been disappointed.  The tagliatelle bolognese and blackened bluefish are favorites.    
The on site parking is a plus and as is access to 295, great place to meet friends coming from north and south of Portland w/out having to hassle with getting into Old Port."
190,"Excellent for a late brunch on a sunny Saturday.  The attention to detail in the renovation of the building is second to none in Portland.  The facility  is gorgeous - take time to appreciate the fittings and fixtures in an architectural gem. 

The menu here is imaginative, eclectic, and mostly well executed except for the hard poached eggs. The iced coffee w tequila is an awesome midmorning eye-opener!  Sweet, rich, and smooth and not too boozy. 

Lobster tacos and lobster eggs Benedict were tasty despite the aforementioned eggs. The hollandaise was kinda bland bland and struggled to hold the dish together.  

Service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive - thanks Hannah!  We'll be back to give other items a try."
191,All food is wonderful .  Rabbit liver mousse is a must have followed by the fennel salad for a second course only leads to the entree.
192,Eggplant Lasagna is the best that I've ever tasted. Lamb sandwich is not short of stellar performance
193,"Steak frites this weekend was absolutely delightful. Flank marinated in Mexican coca cola and red wine, plus beatifully cooked frites with just a hint of beef juice. Unfortunately the attractive branch of broccoli raab, one of my favorite veggies, was drastically undercooked in the stem area. Neither teeth nor steak knife were able to penetrate it. Because the stems cook more slowly than the tops, they should be chopped off and put in the pan first.  Service was very slow, and the server could have just told us the kitchen was backed up or brought us another slice of the tasty bread and excellent olive oil--the three of us got just three slices.
Fix these two easy to fix things, and it's a five star meal. I'll be back nevertheless."
194,"Isa is our favorite restaurant in town. For a small menu it has a wide selection of tastes to fit whatever mood I'm in. The drinks are great as well! Cocktails and wine alike. We love the lobster tostada, watermelon salad, and any of the pasta mains. The coconut creme pie is a great way to end your meal if you've saved any room. Friendly staff, good vibes in the restaurant keep us coming back again and again. Check them out!"
195,"Portland is known to have a fantastic food scene; and I get giddy every time I come to this beautiful, creative little city. We chose isa because of the amazing reviews. We sat at the bar and had a very attentive and kind bartender. (My favorite kind...) we started the Octopus salad. I LOVED THIS! The fennel, golden raisins, and cilantro were a lovely
compliment for the octopus. I had the lobster tacos. The lobster was perfectly cooked and the aioli was delicious, although it was very heavy on the aioli. My advice: ask for light aioli so you can really taste the freshness of the lobster. 

Isa was wonderful...:)"
196,"If you're saying ""gosh I want to try something exciting and new, but I also want something familiar and comforting,"" BAM! You can find that at Isa. I got the avocado beet salad followed by the special of the day, lamb hash topped with 2 fried duck eggs (as did my husband.) It was a unique blend of ingredients, but simple and familiar, and all you could hear after the first bite was the sound of my husband and me eating and making yummy noises. Oh and the tres leches? There is not even a word for it. Seriously, I'm still thinking about it hours after eating it. I will be going back for more ASAP, and nobody can stop me. 

Oh and the bartender/ our server Chris was awesome."
197,"My second visit to Isa in a week...it is FANTASTIC!!  Great menu, excellent and friendly service and great wines!  Go before the outdoor patio closes for the season and enjoy your Sunday Brunch!

Another great meal at one of the best restaurants in Portland. Consistent, excellent personalized service, great menu with local ingredients in a great atmosphere!!  Thank you Suzie for delivering a wonderful dining experience every time!"
198,"Looking for a good spot while driving through Portland on a Friday night but wary of the wait at high profile restaurants, my girlfriend discovered this absolute gem of a restaurant. Located on the back side of Portland, not far from I-295, Isa had everything we could have asked for: convenient parking, an open table and two seats at an elegant bar, friendly staff and food and drink that were simply superb.

We started with an octopus starter and a pork tostada (tasty!). My steak au poivre was perfectly cooked, and Isa's ingredients, menu and presentation are on par with restaurants we frequent in hometown Boston. For dessert, a sour cream pound cake with fresh rhubarb was a tasty and clean end. 

As I said, Isa's food, ambience and service  hold their own with many places we love, whether in Boston or places folks consider the best of Portland. Like many places in Maine, the vibe at Isa remains relaxed and friendly. For us, that just makes their great food taste better. A great surprise find. Highly recommend."
199,"What a GREAT spot, off the beaten path in Portland.  Was in town on a solo business trip and stopped by for lunch.  The lobster stew/chowder was off the charts and the lamb sandwich a real stand out.  Warning - don't go here alone, the menu is awesome.

One more HUGE shout out - the service is off-the-charts and truly appreciated.  I left my hat at the bar and Suzie (the manager) had it back to me in Baltimore in 2 days.  Can't imagine that happening in too many other places.

Treat yourself to Isa, but go with a friend - or even better, a whole slew of friends!"
200,"Phenomenal service. Everyone in our party had allergies. The sous chef Heather came out and worked with us on the menu and she and Chef Josh was easily able to cater to everyone. The restaurant itself is elegant with dim lighting to set a relaxed mood. The staff was amazing. Super friendly and extremely accommodating. Our server Megan was especially friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with the drinks. We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  The bar made me a Cosmopolitan and it was delicious. I had the haddock and it was light and fluffy and the broth was incredibly flavorful. I finished off the meal with a deconstructed cheesecake. It was outstanding. 

I highly recommend this restaurant most especially if you have allergies."
201,"A few weeks ago, a few friends and I decided to meet up at Union for some pre-dinner cocktails. Having never been to Union before, I was excited to experience their venue, as I have walked passed it numerous times.

Upon entering, Union has a modern, American-restaurant aesthetic with wooden floors, modern lighting fixtures and contrasts of black throughout the venue. Union has an expansive bar to sit at with some couch-like bar seating, and a variety of other table seating. On a Saturday night, the bar was definitely popular and busy, which I am assuming is due to Union being in the same building as the Press Hotel. It seemed as though people were coming in to stop for a quick drink before they started making their rounds around the city. 

However, my friends and I opted for the open couch seating by the bar and were quickly greeted by the bar waitress. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and provided AMAZING service. I ordered an extra dirty martini, which was made to perfection, and a couple other friends ordered from the cocktail menu and when they came out, they were presented nicely.

After some time by the bar area, my friends and I figured we might as well stay and try some of Union's dinner options. We were seated in the dining area and again, were quickly greeted by our waitress. Perusing the menu, Union certainly highlights seafood options, which makes sense due to the tourists that stay at the hotel, but they also have a few other protein options beyond seafood. I ended up getting the truffled pot roast, which was served in a small cast iron skillet with vegetables, broth, and some grated horse radish. The flavor profile was amazing and everything was working together nicely. My only negative was that the pot roast was slightly fatty. My friends enjoyed their dishes which included the filet, the scallops, and the salmon.

I ended the night with one of my friends and I sharing the chocolate dolvino, which was a decadent chocolate pudding with pieces of chocolate fudge-like pieces in it. It was incredibly good!

In general, I think Union has a lot to offer. Why not five stars? I think their prices are exponentially inflated for what they are offering. If they brought the price points down on their options, I think they would have even more success, but regardless, I will be sure to be back, even if only for some pre-dinner cocktails and/or dessert."
202,"Very good food, great service and a complimentary dessert that I would marry if it was 1) legal and 2) my husband allowed it.

I've always wanted to come here and when the stars aligned for my birthday and we had a gift card, I knew it was time.

We started out with the cheese plate for $18 which seemed a bit steep for what we got but the cheeses were delicious. I especially liked the cheese.from Fuzzy Udder that looked like brie but wasn't. At the same time, we also got the artisan bread that came with whipped lardo and Casco Bay butter, both a little salty but equally delicious. Did we need all of that? Of course.

For our main dishes, I got the buttermilk fried chicken which came with hen of the wood mushrooms, spoonbread and some dill pickle cauliflower. I am NOT a mushroom person but I decided I was going to try everything. They were delicious and didn't have the slimy texture of most mushrooms. My chicken was very crispy and had a sweetness to it that I really liked. My husband got the sea scallops that came with a succotash and crispy pork shoulder. He cleaned his plate so I'm assuming he enjoyed it.

Finally we got dessert because it was my birthday after all! The chocolate budino sounded amazing so we ordered that. Its a rich chocolate mousse with a chocolate torte and some cream. I could have licked the bowl when we we're finished. It was probably the best thing we had all evening. Even better, it came out with a lit candle and they gave it to us for free!

The last thing I'll mention is the service. It was wonderful. Our waiter was attentive without hovering and was knowledgeable about the food. He was really great and wished me a happy birthday a few times. I really recommend visiting Union."
203,"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED
This restaurant is magnificent.  The food was superb.  Definately a 5 star if I could give it a 7 I would!  Service was A+, Menu was diverse and the flavors, oh the flavors, just HEAVEN ON EARTH!!"
204,"Great spot inside the Press Hotel. Not too crowded at lunchtime. Started with the brussels sprouts, which were awesome, and the clam dip which came spread out on a plate with a pile of thin twisted fritter and chive powder - wow! The frisee salad was pretty standard but good and the white bean soup had a nice flavor to it but had lamb in it that sunk to the bottom. I would have preferred it without the lamb. We were sadly too full for dessert but would for sure like to come back for dinner and a treat another time."
205,"Food tasted good, but the portion sizes were very small for their steep prices (thank goodness for that bread and butter that comes with dinner). 

Our octopus was cooked well and we enjoyed our drinks, but it's one of those restaurants where they focus on the plate decor instead of the quality/ quantity of the food. Pretty, but not enough."
206,"My extended family surprised me with a 50th birthday party here the other night.  For whatever reason, this restaurant has never been on my radar but I was very impressed nevertheless. Obviously, I was not part of the planning, but my sister said the restaurant and the event planner were very helpful and good to work with. As the recipient of the festivities, here are my impressions.

Our waitress was excellent.  I made a deliberate effort to  remember her name so I could publicly acknowledge her, but alas, a martini and a good bit of Cabernet Sauvignon ruined that.  Nevertheless she was a perfect blend of attentive and timely.  She always seemed to be there when you needed her but was not intrusive or overbearing.

The food overall was excellent however the complimentary bread was quite boring.  Nevertheless, things improved quickly from there.  I had the veal carpaccio which was plated beautifully and was a wonderful contrast of textures.  Veal might be a touch too bland for the dish, but it still was a pleasant experience.  I chose the truffled pot roast for my entree.  Some members of my family expressed their surprise that I did not pick something ""fancier"" but I had a good feeling about this.  I was definitely right..... beautifully tender meat and a truffled jus that was fantastic!  

Everyone I talked to in our party enjoyed their meals.  Even my finicky daughter loved her chicken dish and even tried the mushrooms that they were saut√©ed with.

The best of the meal was that my father picked up the tab for the whole meal, which judging by his facial expression was painful."
207,"Very nice dinner at Union! A friend recommended Union, so we were looking forward to it!
Hip place, nice menu!  Kim had the Bolognese, I had the cod, both very good! Excellent service!"
208,"Lunch here is sunny with great service and tasty noms. 

On a lark, I went here on a business lunch and it's the perfect venue for such an outing. I could see it being a cosy place for two friends sharing a lunch break also. During the day, it does not strike me as romantic but at night, it could be. 

We ordered the truffle oil potato chips with ranch dip for an appetizer and they. are. rich. Do not order these for ""something light.""  They are incredible and tasty; excellent balance of salt and creamy if you use that homemade ranch dipping sauce. A table of four will polish them off, but for two people, it's a challenge. 

For lunch, I got the burger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, cheese, and ""Union sauce.""  It was a great burger, moist and fresh and cooked well. The English muffin as the bun was the let down. It took away from what could have been an outstanding burger! It was dry and flavorless. Give us a pretzel bun or Kaiser roll or just a sesame hamburger bun and it'll make all the difference. The Union sauce was unknown but it complimented the meats/cheese/veggies well. 

It comes with a salad (which after the chips I should have gotten) or fries. I opted for the fries and THEY ARE FRENCH FRIED FINGERLING POTATOES!! Cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly, I was so happy to have gotten them--despite my fried food overload. 

I ordered coffee too. It's good. Have no idea if it's Sanka or Tandem or CBD or what, but a good cup of joe is a good cup of joe, ifyouknowhatImean. 

Our server was delightful. I'd give her a shout out but I can't remember her name. Very attentive-never let our water deplete! A+++ for that. 

That English muffin bun fiasco is the only thing from giving Union a fourth star. I'll be back though as there were plenty of things I wanted to try on the menu."
209,"Came to Union for brunch while in Portland, Maine and loved it!! The restaurant was beautifully decorated and very modern. 

We ordered the eggs Benedict and the cornbeef hash and the cleansing juice, and all the items we got were amazing!!! The juice was fantastic and so unique, I would highly recommend it. It was very flavorful and gingery. 

Overall a great restaurant in downtown Portland, in a great location, with a very delicious brunch menu!"
210,"Huge foodie and was super excited to try this place. But I left disappointed. 

Started off with the ""local favorites"" seared tuna. $18 for 4 pieces of seared tuna with not enough sauce and too much garlic oil on the slaw. Too many competing and contrasting flavors, dish didn't know what it wanted to be. Skip. 

Then had the braised lobster with corn fritters and Summer corn chowder. I basically chose this restaurant for this dish, because these are three of my favorite things to eat! Shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Lobster was cooked perfectly, but the corn fritters were extremely salty and dry. Also no corn kernels to be found! I've found that the best corn fritters often have actual pieces of corn in them. Dish left more to be desired. 

Boyfriend had the crab pasta, which was the best dish we tried. Wish I had ordered that instead. But it came with mint on top, which was very unsettling. 

Ended with the deconstructed whipped cheesecake. Definitely the best part of the meal, would highly recommend! 

Decor is beautiful, service nothing to write home about. There have to be better restaurants in Portland."
211,The food is fresh and delicious. The portions are generous. The service is impeccable. Must visit if you are in Portland
212,"Fantastic birthday meal here. Service was stellar. We started with two dry ciders, very good. Shared an appetizer, the poached duck egg. Executed to perfection. Smoky and buttery and decadent. For dinner, the sirloin was soft and succulent, great use of Hen of the Woods mushrooms. Flavor was on point. Other dish, the Hake was fantastic too. Great baby clams, perfectly cooked bok-choy, house made Chinese sausage, kim-chi. Just a great flavor combo. Lots of Umami in the broth the fish sat upon. Only disappointment was the gelato sold as salted caramel but tasted more like butterscotch. A small difference and didn't change the fact that this restaurant's food quality and cost were great. Definitely recommend and would return for sure."
213,"Nestled on the first floor of the Press Marriott Hotel, this very pricey restaurant has unusual and tasty dishes.
The Lobster Bisque loaded with mostly potatoes, vegetables and crackers is worth a try. I would have preferred more Lobster in it. The Liver Pate Appetizer was interesting but not spectacular.
We ordered two Chef Signature dishes. One the Cod Dish and the other Pot Roast. According to my husband the chef,  the Pit Roast couldn't have been prepared better!
The Cod dish was interesting and the clams and nik Chou were delicious. 
The desserts are quite unique as well. I would recommend the Apple Br√ªl√©e which was light and delicious! Top that off with a capuchin o! Yum!"
214,Went to celebrate my aunt's birthday it was everything she expected. The service was amazing from the waitress to the valet parking. Food was deliouse. As a starter we got the Burratta absolutely amazing! I got the slow cooked lamb shoulder and my aunt the salmon. Not a huge sweet person but thr dessert was sooo good
215,"Definitely one of Portland's Finest and now jumping up my top 5 in the city for good, reliable COMFORT FOOD... from pot toast to their amazing fresh pasta with bolognese sauce... trust me... it's like none other. 
Our waiter, Randy explained how the pasta is made with little 'nooks' in it ... I think we would think it's 'irregular' but the chef has this thing about keeping the sauce sticking to the pasta while you gain full flavor... MASTERED! 
There is a very unique texture to this dish and trust me, you'll go back for more or you'll try hard to make not so perfect pasta for this very reason. 

Appetizers are creative (shrimp and hominy) will be a great start or try the brussels... in s category completely of their own. Huge Brussels sprouts fan here so I love to see what a chef can do with them... these guys nailed it.

Union has climbed my ranks of awesomeness and with the food scene getting better by the day in Portland, this is one you won't want to miss. 

Cheers! Thanks guys! Great Grub!"
216,"I absolutely love this place. I go just about every other week for brunch and everything is amazing. My favorite is the huevos rancheros, because of all the different flavors included in one dish. I also love the muffins and bacon. This is a very nice restaurant with lots of details. 10/10 would recommend going to this place."
217,"Trying to diet in this city is very difficult! The good in Portland is so good but not always health conscious. I've been coming to Union for breakfast on weekends because I can get a very good dish of eggs, with wheat toast and turkey sausage that is very dry and not dripping with grease.

Today, our server Bridget even offered to replace the potatoes with berries for me. Her demeanor the entire meal was absolutely delightful. It's always good here but today was really exceptional."
218,"Came here for a Sunday brunch and we were immediately seated. We ordered the corned beef hash, crab pasta and the seafood chowder. The pasta was quite good with plentiful crab meat pieces. The corned beef hash was okay and nothing really stood out. The biggest disappointment was the seafood chowder. For $14, I expected a bit more. But what we got was a bowl of mainly fish pieces, ginger and some potato. There was literally no chowder or broth. The bowl was small too but even then it didn't taste appetizing to finish. Overall, the environment and decor seems nice but for the price maybe go elsewhere for brunch."
219,"Absolutely fantastic! Such a great addition to the Old Port. We popped in late Saturday and were able to be seated within just ten minutes even though we didn't have a reservation. I had probably one of the best old fashioneds ever, perfectly balanced and sweet. The crab pasta I had for dinner was absolutely amazing. So pretty and tasted beyond what I thought a pasta could taste like. My companion really enjoyed his swordfish special and said it was the best he had ever had. 

Two things that keep this from being a five star review: The first is that the dessert I had was honestly ""meh"". I had the Union M&M's standing for macarons, madeleines, and meringues. While generous in amount (two of each dessert), each item tasted like it was store-bought and not all that unique. The madeleines were very dry and had no taste to them, while the macarons were hard and crunchy instead of light and airy. Definitely wouldn't order this again. 

The second is that a few days after the dinner went through on my credit card, I noticed that the total of my bill was slightly higher than what I wrote down on my slip. It was just a few dollars more, so nothing that's going to wipe me out, but it does seem a bit dishonest that the server would think its okay to add more money to her tip, when I didn't write that amount down. Maybe pay in cash next time to avoid being swindled. 


I definitely will be back to enjoy the food! But ask to make sure the desserts are fresh and make sure your tip is what you left!"
220,"On my recent visit to Portland, I chose this restaurant based on reviews on Open Table when looking for a place to dine. It also was located in our hotel, the Press Hotel.  The restaurant itself has a contemporary feel. There's a dining area and a bar area. I was underwhelmed by the service received at this restaurant.  The young gentleman serving us seem like we were a bother.  As a waitress in my younger years, I notice good service and I expect a server to approach the table and introduce himself. That did not happen.  I was very surprised as we received nothing but special and courteous treatment from the staff members of the hotel. My husband and I started with a couple cocktails from the bar and ordered two of the appetizers. The seared goat cheese and the roasted carrots, both were delicious.  I was, however, disappointed that the carrots only had six colorful petite carrots on the plate.  I ordered the scallops for my dinner and my husband had the special fish of the night. He enjoyed his entr√©e. I loved the fennel that was served with my three scallops. They were perfectly grilled and tender. Again, the food was good but the service was lacking. I had no refill on my water until after I was finished with my meal.  I expect more from a restaurant that charges these prices. I expect to be waited on by a friendly and attentive staff member who introduces themselves, which did not happen. For my last night in Portland, I wanted this to be a special meal and that is why I chose Union.  The dinner we had at David's restaurant in Portland was so much better as we were treated wonderfully and waited on attentively. I think Union could learn a thing or two from David's management on how to train service staff.  It really does make a difference for the all-around experience while dining."
221,"I HIGHLY reccomend the chef's table at Union for a special occasion...such a delightful and delicious experience! We just did the 5 course chef's tasting menu for my birthday. The chef (actually sous chef, Bri) lead us through a personalized menu (no meat for me/no dairy for my man). The food was outstanding...creative, thoughtful and local. The whole kitchen team was spot on. Thanks a million for making my birthday so special!"
222,"Made a reservation for 11am brunch. Arrived a few minutes early. Waited 10 minutes, had three different hostesses talk to us before we were finally seated (and there were multiple tables open). They all seemed incredibly confused. Ordered granola and milk, as listed on the menu. The granola arrived with no milk and no spoon. Had to ask for milk and then was charged extra for it. Server removed the charge but indicated we were wrong even though granola and milk was an ITEM ON THE MENU. I give up! Food good but won't be back."
223,"I truly want to love this place.

I just can't seem to make it work, though.

If I was from out of state and was coming to Portland, there's a good chance this is one of the hotels I would end up at. And, who knows, maybe I would check out Union for breakfast (which I *still* hear is amazing years later, and am *still* going to try one of these days) or a cocktail and love it. But... as a local who knows some of the great locations throughout the city for food, drink, and service, this place continues to underwhelm me. Despite the many times I've now been here, I always leave wishing I had chosen a different bar. 

+/- Cocktails 
During the winter they've got this fig and walnut concoction that might be one of the best in the city; unfortunately, they're pretty strict about only making what's on their current menu. Recently I had a $14 cocktail that was 2/3 full and tasted of watered-down lime juice (it was even greenish in color). Frustrating since I bought something that was supposed to be bourbon, apple brandy, and cinnamon simple syrup. My friend's cocktail tasted like a warm melted chapstick. They both were bad enough that after one sip I asked her if she wanted to go to a different bar. I would have liked to talk to the bartender about our drinks, but... 

- Service
At my latest experience, the bartender wasn't personable or attentive at all. At least not to us. We ordered two rounds of drinks, and both times they seemed to come out staggered (we're talking twenty or so minutes between her drink and mine arriving). Beyond that, he wouldn't look at us when taking or delivering our orders - he was fixated on a large group of business men just behind us. Weird thing to note, I know, but it's weirder to be ""talking"" to someone who's looking past your shoulder at other people. And when explaining our drinks and food, he literally walked away mid-sentence (multiple times) to take care of someone else. So... not feeling especially wanted here.

- Food
I still can't wrap my brain around that cheese plate being almost $20. Yes, it's definitely more ample and balanced then it was when they first opened, but I've had cheese plates at nearly every place in town, and have had just as good or better for far cheaper and more plentiful. It's definitely not worth the price tag.

I'm so sorry, Union. I just don't get it. I don't know if it's me. If it's you. If it's me plus you. I will absolutely give it another go, though, because I'm determined to make us work... but first, I just need to get the taste of this lime drink out my mouth."
224,"Visiting Portland for a few days, we wanted to end the trip with a nice sit down dinner. Based on the reviews on here, we easily picked Union to eat at.
Coming from New Jersey, we are used to heavily packed restaurants around dinner time. But there was no wait at 6pm. There were a good amount of people at the bar and a few tables filled. 
The food is amazing. The house made bread was great. I'm a huge fan of the free bread anywhere. We had the crab pasta as an appetizer, and that did not disappoint at all. My friend and I both ordered the salmon dish and were nothing but pleased. It was delicious. We didn't talk the entire time because of how good it was. Well portioned. Cooked well. The flavors were balanced well. As my friend put it ""exquisite."" I don't want to call it perfect, because what do I know about food, but it was very good.
We felt that we were underdressed and there was no fuss about it. The service was phenomenal. Monica, our waitress, was beyond pleasant and absolutely wonderful to have. 
Portland is a wonderful area and we will be back for sure in the future with friends and we will make sure to stop by union to eat again!!"
225,Went for brunch on a Saturday and was quite impressed. French toast was one of the best I've had and the Brussels sprouts appetizer was tasty and original. Overall definitely one of the better brunch/breakfasts I've had recently. Would return to try lunch/dinner in the future.
226,"I'd actually give this a 3-point-something. It was better than OK, but nothing great either.  I'm not sure what exactly seemed to bother me about this place, but it felt like they didn't live up to their expectations. 

For one, it's restaurant week, and they are listed on the Maine Restaurant Week website. When they called to confirm the reservation, and restaurant week was inquired about, the man on the phone said it was the ""chef's surprise."" Oh? Maybe I'll surprise the chef with anaphylactic shock in return. Ok, well, no big deal; one can always ask more questions upon arrival. 

Upon arrival, the table wasn't ready. Fortunately, I am always happy to drink my night away, so I asked for my numbing-concoction-of-choice: Maker's on the rocks. Had I not spewed out that decision at the speed of lightning as I always do, the bartender didn't come back around for a while. Granted, he was busy, just not very personable. Maybe I wasn't there with the right person to enjoy myself. There were couples to my left and right who seemed to be sexually active with one another, so I guess I should just be happy for them. 

When the table was ready, we closed out and moved.  Our waitress was really friendly. She didn't mention restaurant week, but I asked for menu items, and she did deliver. I thought they paled in comparison to all other local restaurant-week menus because there was only one (as opposed to three) options. I think they are a little misleading to say they partake in restaurant week, but then once you arrive it's ""we always have a tasting menu available.""

The cheese plate was eh. I tried the three cheeses and only didn't want to barf on one of them.   One was cheddar-like and the others were very potent varieties, which aren't my taste. The parsnip soup I didn't partake in. The brussel sprouts were great, and my favorite part of the night. Meal: I had the pork shank. It was fine. It was luke warm and under salted, and I could never quite get my waitress' attention, so I gave up and ordered another drink. Other dish: Scallops. They were good, and quite oppositely salted compared to my dish.  Had to say no to dessert, so I can't judge that category. 

Meh."
227,"We tried to get into Eventide Oyster Co., but were seated outside with the narrow tables - didn't think we could eat comfortably with 3 people!

So, we ubered over Union as our Plan B.  It is so beautiful inside -  clean and refined.  My friend and I ordered the seared tuna app  and the salmon curry!  So so so delicious!  My other friend ordered the lobster roll and the avocado toast.  Both were to die for!

The best part of the meal was our waiter and bartender Isaac!  Our conversations with him was like our dessert.  He recommended a ton of places we plan on patronizing the next time we are in town.  He was the Alexa of Yelp.  

We will definitely be back at the Union!"
228,"Visiting from San Francisco. It's hard to top good food with where we hail from. Hanger steak was excellent, Hake amended for me as a gluten-free option was out of this world (spicy and exceptional sauce that I used my spoon with)...chocolate Budino and deconstructed cheese cake was excellent. Love the atmosphere of bustling lobby couches and a great bar with dinner tables interspersed."
229,"Had breakfast.  There were 6 of us, sat at the high top by the window. Service was very good.  They were able to accommodate gluten free diets. We had the avocado toast, omelettes, lighter fare egg whites.  Food came quickly and was delicious."
230,Red flannel hash was delicious! Corned beef and beets was a nice combo and I might have to make this at home soon. Good coffee. Nice space in downtown Portland. Service was friendly. Kinda pricey but the food was very good.
231,"Delightful! 
GLUTEN FREE accommodations were excellent and we will return. 
We were searching for a place that was new to both of us for Maine Restaurant Week. We opted for Union at The Press Hotel and are so glad we did! 
We both chose to do the ""surprise"" 3 course MRW option. The cocktail I ordered was very well made and exactly as I'd asked for; it WAS pricey at $14, but delicious.
The staff was incredibly accommodating and polite, knowledgable and answering my questions sufficently."
232,"Solid breakfast. I love their hash with fingerling potatoes and beets. Topped with two perfectly poached eggs. Coffee by design coffee. 
We started with cantaloupe served over cottage cheese. Sprinkled with grape nuts and pistachios. Yum. 
My only hang up is that the bloody Mary's are served in a tall skinny glass. Hardly anything there and very pricy."
233,"Located in a swanky hotel, Union is a rather formal dining room in a otherwise fairly casual Portland food scene. 

And so it comes as no surprise that service was impeccable. Our waitperson was very efficient, accommodating and knowledgeable.

5 star for service.

What was less than stellar was the food. Given the high star rating and beautiful interior, i was expecting similarly amazing food.

The best things?
- zucchini crab cakes -phenomenal, fresh and not at all oily
- salad - ask delicious and fresh
- burrata - super creamy with a little jolt of weirdness with the presence of raisin like fruit
- salmon - very fresh and well seared 

Okay, not great
- corn with potatoes - this didn't work for me. The corn was light and fresh but the potatoes tasted starchy and mushy and so than texture didn't complement the crisp corn
- pot roast - disappointing; lacked flavor and salt. The root vegetables were bland
- cookies -these ""house made"" cookies tasted like cheap store bought pecan sundies and chips ahoy and Costco madeleines.
- house bread - this is obviously very rustic but was a little too hearty. Felt like I was eating super high fiber spelt bread
- tofu pesto risotto - okay, probably my fault for ordering such a dish but I wanted to try something different. This was a fail - why tofu at all? Wrong texture. Pesto was made from arugula which made it unbearably bitter without the fragrance of basil.

So the 4 rating reflects superior service(5) and solid tho not spectacular (3) food"
234,"We had drinks and apps at Ink Well, the bar at Union/ The Press Hotel. It was a little disappointing that after 7 of us were sitting in the lounge foe 20 minutes, I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender is someone could serve us drinks and if we could order food.... the response was ""of course we can serve you, we were waiting for someone to let us know you were ready""...... 
well... the apps were wonderful, drinks good.... I just feel at what is one on the most high end hotels in Portland ......you should not have to go to the bar and asked to be served...."
235,Beautiful inside. Fantastic offerings. Food was amazing . Gluten free options available
236,"Woooow such a treat to enjoy a meal here at Union! While I usually stay away from hotel restaurants (they tend to be over hyped with less exciting menus) I loved Union. Every bite was delicious and perfectly balanced and I wish I lived closer to Portland so I could come back here. 

The braised lobster featured a velvety cream broth that somehow made the lobster taste even more lobstery! This was one of my most favorite meals in Portland, hands down."
237,"We went to Union for brunch on a Sunday. There was no wait. It's inside a hotel which we didn't realize until we got there. Good food, nice space and good service. We got avocado toast with bacon and a benedict. Both were pretty good. Coffee wasn't the best around. The thing that threw me off was the price. I think it was overpriced. Food was good but not worth the price."
238,"Stopped in to try the new appetizer and drink special menu...and wow! A crab roll (as in not lobster, and totally fabulous), sliders, charred octopus, sangria, beer. Delicious, affordable and such a great spot to perch and watch, by great staff. 
I can't wait to go back."
239,"Located in the Press Hotel, this was one of the best breakfasts I've had.  Everything is fresh and perfectly cooked with just the right seasoning.  The maple sausage is amazing, and you have to try the homemade jams."
240,"Terrific meal, great staff, nice menu including cocktails and mocktails, and beautiful spot. We brought some cupcakes to do a mini gender reveal, just the two of us, and they were super gracious with plates and even some complimentary cookies to enjoy along side. A perfect place to celebrate our upcoming boy!"
241,Super good breakfast place. English muffin and blueberry muffins were amazing. Waitress could've been friendlier but maybe she was having a bad day.
242,"Popped in here for a snack and drink. The atmosphere was great- bar is kind of small but it's cozy and there are seats at the bar, couches and assorted table seating.

There wasn't much in the way of cocktails on the menu but they seem to have a decent variety of liquor. We just stuck to beer tonight and the selection was good.

For the snack we ordered the chicken liver pate. I'm not a huge liver lover- I've had amazing liver toasts in Italy and had horrible experiences elsewhere so it was a toss up but it was the best thing out of the options given we had plans to get cheese and charcuterie elsewhere later tonight. The chicken liver pate came out on a thick piece of grilled bread that was cut into thirds and had a side of mushrooms and a runny egg. The pate was chilled but with the warm bread, egg and mushrooms it was perfect. Even my boyfriend who is completely anti liver couldn't help trying it and was pleasantly surprised.

Great experience. The entrees on the menu look pricey for Portland but judging by what we saw come out- we'd definitely come back to try this for dinner next time."
243,Good food - uneven service. Had there burger and it very good. Served on a muffin. Had the homemade chips as well - they were great. Water was slow to he refilled. One server kind of hovered to take the plates as soon as you were done. Not necessary.
244,"My family stopped in for brunch yesterday. There was enough variety on the menu for everyone to find something they loved, including the kids. Lovely atmosphere, great service and delicious food! I loved it."
245,"Oh where do I start... I have wanted to come here ever since they opened. I met a friend here for drinks and an appetizer after work on a Wednesday. I ordered a drink that I honestly can't remember what it was called, but it was made with rhubarb and something else and it was hot. The description sounded delicious the product was anything but... it tasted like melted crayons. My friend ordered a lime flavored drink, the Old Orchard I believe. It literally tasted like watery lime juice. Our drinks didn't even come at the same time, it was very odd service. Our bartender really seemed extremely disinterested in us. No eye contact, no smile, no friendly bartender banter... nothing. 
My second drink, a Dark and Stormy, was good, but it's hard to mess that up. My friends 2nd drink was an extra dirty martini  she said it was just eh. 
The $18 cheese plate was delicious, but not even close to worth the price. 
I think that next time I'll try the Inkwell instead."
246,First time in Portland and this place was recommended by a bartender at Bull Feeney's. I am so glad we listened. The eggs benny with lobster was to die for. Delicious brunch cocktails also.
247,"The three stars goes to the awesome bartender since the food was mediocre at best. I had the thanksgiving 3-course meal. $55 to get tendons that were as hard as fish bones in my turkey. What if those tendons got stuck in my throat? My server/bartender was very attentive and quickly asked the kitchen to explain. The host was pretty awful, too. She would constantly stare into something behind me instead of making eye contacts while talking to me. Girl did you see a ghost behind me? This is place is certainly overrated. Not a fan."
248,"Stopped in late last night for a drink and dessert. I was very impressed with the decor and ambience. I'm a fan of the solid marble bar top. Wish there was a foot rest under the bar, but no biggie.
Wine list was very well composed. Service was great. Dessert was very well executed. The description on the menu seemed vague compared to the complex, but playful dish we were served. I will definitely be back for an actual meal."
249,"Can't say enough good things about their delicious food! Their use of fresh, high quality ingredients was very evident, every bite was incredible! Would highly recommend if you're looking for high-end quality but completely unpretentious and prices are very reasonable for the quality."
250,This restaurant is just ok. I had the simple breakfast and they put most of the fruit in the mustard. The cheese wasn't very fresh. The ham was pretty good and so was the croissant. Those were the only things that were good.
251,I'm not usually a fan of restaurants in hotels.  This place was different.  So good.  Would recommend the swordfish.
252,"We loved this restaurant which is located in the Press Hotel in downtown Portland Maine.  It is a lively place, but still quiet enough to enjoy a conversation.  We were there on a Sunday night, so Friday and Saturday nights may have a higher noise volume.

Three of our group started with the Maine Crab pasta as an appetizer.  It is a fairly rich dish and if you order it, you may not want to get a large entree.

For my entree, I ordered the Mountain Trout, and I was not disappointed.  The trout was cooked perfectly and was served with new potatoes, porcini mushroom & asparagus cream sauce.

Another in our party ordered the Faroe Island Salmon and I was told that it was delightful.

Our group's desserts included the Chocolate Budino and Blueberry Sorbet.
Both dishes were big hits."
253,"Great option if you are staying at the Press hotel. Here's the rundown:

Scallops - A
Brussels - A +
Arugula salad A- 
Erik was great at the bar
Misses - the soup, dessert 

Had breakfast here the next morning and was impressed."
254,"This place has been on my list for a while so I finally went with some friends for an after work cocktail. I was deciding between The Riot and The Down East. I explained my dilemma to the bartender and he asked me whether I wanted to go ""tart"" or ""effervescent."" I went for the latter and ended up the tasty and refreshingly light Down East cocktail. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts with chimichurri and cheese curds. I love Brussels sprouts and these did not disappoint!! 

I would like to visit Union again for some more drinks and food. I love the clean lines of the space and the overall vibe of the place. Definitely will go back!!"
255,"Visited Portland for the weekend and Union was the highlight! The cocktails were out of control amazing, I had the garden party which was extremely refreshing as well as the small sword which was spicy but not overwhelming. The brussel sprouts were unlike anything I have ever had before, charred to PERFECTION! I could have stopped there and would have been fully satisfied but then came the main course. I cannot put into words the way the Maine crab pasta made me feel, but I think I died and went to heaven for about fifteen minutes. I go out to eat a lot, but have never written a review on yelp before; I'm making an exception for Union because this experience was exceptional! Shout out to our lovely server Maria. She was very nice and gave great recommendations. This place is a little on the expensive side but totally worth it"
256,"Had a very nice dinner here Saturday, and the service was really excellent, but the flavors in my main course were a little disappointing, especially given rave reviews. I made the reservation a week prior, and I did it over the phone, because the times I wanted weren't available online, and I was so impressed when they asked about any allergies (I have a dairy allergy). It would have been cool if the server had this info when we sat down, but he knew how to help me when I brought it up after we sat down. The hostess too went out of her way to help find some bread I could have to dip in olive oil while the others at our table snacked on their regular bread and butter. I was really intrigued by the homemade venison sausages on the menu, so two of us split that to start, and the other two enjoyed the squash salad. My wine was very expensive at $16 a glass, but it was also one of the best ones I've ever had. For the main course I went with the scallops and clams with pasta and leeks, which I found somewhat disappointing. I would have liked more seasoning for the broth, like thyme, to lighten and freshen up the flavor. 

This place came highly recommended from two contacts from back home in Portland, so I might like to give this place a second try next time I visit."
257,"great food, we went for breakfast because we were staying in the hotel upstairs and it was included with our room. i'm more of a greasy diner kind of gal so this was a little fancy for my taste, but delicious nonetheless!"
258,"Only ordered drinks and an appetizer.. The drinks were slightly above average, but the charcuterie plate was not worth the price."
259,"What a gem in Portland! Got lucky driving around Old Port and saw this place and there was a parking spot outside. glad we decided to go in!

I had the Smoked Salmon tartine (SO GOOD) and my boyfriend got avocado toast, which he added lobster to. We couldn't decide which was better. & the roasted potato side, YUM!

My favorite part was the bloody mary, which was perfectly seasoned and came with everything seasoning spice on the rim. It wasn't  on the brunch menu - so glad i asked if they did brunch cocktails because it was fantastic. 

Highly recommend."
260,"Delicious food, great service, warm and relaxing ambiance.  We arrived a half hour early for our dinner reservation but were seated immediately, and served an impressive array of savory dishes.  My dining companion is a vegetarian and I am a pesca-vegetarian, and we were both keeping Passover (gluten free) on top of this - so it's not an easy feat to serve a satisfying dinner with these restrictions!  But Union pulled it off with ease.  I haven't eaten this well for months."
261,"Very surprised and delighted by my meal at Union last night. The 5 star rating is because this is one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. I'm not keen on most restaurants is inside hotels so I was a little ok I started looking for a different place to eat, so I was very skeptical.

I stayed because of the Yelp reviews. I sat in the bar area, a bit cold with the door continually opening and closing. They have a chefs table I could have moved to but I felt bad knowing the tip for the meal would go to someone other than the nice staff who had been serving me.

I ordered the Salmon with beets and horseradish, fingerling roasted Maine potatoes and the bok choy. Honestly didn't know how the salmon, beets and horseradish would work together but it was amazing!! The serving size was huge, happily took home left overs and will enjoy them again. The perks of being out of town working for the weekend.

Happy I ventured out in the rain and decided to stay. If your unsure, you should definitely take the time and try it. I was pleasantly surprised, even sent a thank you to the chef."
262,"I had brunch at Union on a Sunday afternoon and was very surprised by how empty it was. Considering the accolades it has received I figured it would have more than 3 tables occupied.

I was seated by the friendly host and provided with three menus...two of which were for alcohol. I was surprised to see that the only menu available at 1:45pm on a Sunday was the Brunch menu, I always thought of Brunch as being earlier in the day, but I was thankful I had eaten a hearty breakfast of an ""Andrew's Behemoth"" at Fernald's Country Store in Damariscotta two hours before, on my trip from the Lincoln County down in to Portland. 

At Union i ordered the Baby Arugula salad which had a delicate flavor and texture, save for the green tomatoes which were a bit too green and hard for my liking. The charred corn, and other parts of the salad were fantastic though and I would order it again.

I followed this up with the Spanish Tortilla which is essentially an omelette. I subbed chicken for the chorizo as I'm not a fan of pro and found the omelette to be acceptable. I'm not a big omelette fan but it was the only thing that I could get on the menu which is incredibly small - Duckfat has more options. The wheat toast that came with the egg dish however was quite good and there sure was no shortage of mix ins within the omelette which made for a hearty dish. 

I was really looking forward to one of their sandwiches and was very disappointed to not see any of the menu during my trip. Throughout the 45 minutes I was  there I was looked after quite well by a very competent wait staff, among the best I've experienced in Maine. I'm looking forward to giving Union another try in the future but I doubt I'll revisit for Brunch due to the very limited selection."
263,"We had another wonderful meal at Union.   While their preparations aren't without issue or calamity all the time, their promptness to take care of issues and the speed with which they react makes this a 4/5 star experience.    This was our fourth time here.    Last time, I had an entre issue and it was fixed and removed from the bill.   This time, the pork chop was, unfortunately, not cooked at all at the bone.   It had been removed too quickly from the grill, and I found in the last bite it still wasn't cooked sufficiently.    They removed the charge for the entre and I got an extra few swallows of wine in my glass to make amends.    We will come back, unquestionably."
264,This has to be one of the best restaurants in town. The chef... Scott...is great. He's open and friendly and willing to do anything to please your palate! Staff is so friendly and professional. Special cudos to Bridget and Martin for their exquisite advice and conversation. Love this place...I highly recommend it!!
265,"Pretty solid cocktail bar, with yummy oysters! Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to try other meals, but definitely worth going back and trying more. And in Portland, that statement means a lot, what with so many delicious places to become regulars!"
266,"We ate brunch there yesterday, and cannot think of any other word to say other than ""stupedous"".  The ambience, the food, the drinks, the server that we had.....all above the top.  And for the quality of everything, reasonably priced compared to the city in which we live.

The food:::::::so fresh, so creative presented and put together, the ingredients, so imagination of putting certain ingredients together.....fabulous.

The drink:::::::whoever comes up with the drink, a thank you for putting the time and imagination in them.  Never ever had a bloody mary so good!!!!!

The server:::::polite, informative, attentive, cannot say enough about her.  

So,whether you live in Portland or are visiting, do not hesitate to go there."
267,"Contemporary, upscale. Uncomplicated but limited menu, according to my taste. Service was pleasant. Prices were pricey. $4 cup of coffee is high. I would not order what I had again. (egg white frittata with spinach, mushroom, tofu.) Slice of wheat toast had substance. Fingerling home fried potatoes were very tasty. Hubby had huevo rancheros, and liked it enough to have it again, but admitted he'd had better. Presentation was simple, creative and pleasing. Still not a fan of what I ordered, or the price of a cup of joe, which is the reason for only 3 stars."
268,"we came here for breakfast on a Wednesday; the food was very good, except for the kids french toast which had very little egg!
there are many servers and managers on the floor, but they are so disorganized they were very slow. nice, but not efficient. i
got my coffee quickly but waited for 10 minutes for milk and sugar. 
we had the hash - delicious! - and the croissant with ham and cheese. very very good, and the presentation was beautiful. also, EXCELLENT coffee!"
269,"The complexity of spices they incorporate into one meal is an act of love for each customer. We loved our server he was extremely proud of the hotel and restaurant it was refreshing to say the least. Over all excellent service, eye catching decor, and magnificent Brussel sprouts."
270,"We had a very good dinner with an out of town guest this past weekend, on our third visit to the restaurant. Grilled brussel sprouts with aioli and fresh peas with bacon were the vegetable standouts. The smoked tomato soup was outstanding, as was the pasta with crabmeat. In a town with many great restaurants, Union held its own."
271,"I was dying to try Union and check out The Press Hotel since the first buzz. Farm to table in a cool hotel seemed like a great experience/date night. 

The atmosphere was cool but it wasn't what I expected. I thought the attention to theme would spill over from the hotel part to the restaurant. Not a huge deal. Just an observation. 

The food was good, but I wasn't blown away. 

For apps we got a seasonal salad and a poached egg (served in jars over mushrooms & whipped ricotta-yum!)

There were a decent amount of vegetarian small plate options but entrees offered the one tried and true risotto. It was a blue cheese risotto with walnut pesto. Flavorful enough but not the best I've ever had.

Service was great and attentive! I got up to use the rest room (have to walk through the lobby of the hotel) and placed my napkin on the table. Someone came around and replaced it with a freshly folded one."
272,"We went to Union last night after looking at multiple different options. It was our first night in Portland and we thought the reviews were promising - and let me tell you, I don't regret going at all. 

I got the three course tasting menu, and my girlfriend got three courses to match so that the timing we consistent. The tasting menu last night was mushroom based which was amazing. The chef came and told us about it and I was immediately sold. The staff was welcoming and the ambiance was warm and friendly (the press Hotel is also beautiful). 

I started wth a mushroom fris√©e salad with local apples and sherry. It was beautiful light and delicious with hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the crispy Brussels sprouts with walnuts and she didn't speak to me because she was too busy enjoying the food! That's when you know it's delicious. Our entrees were taking awhile, but we were too busy speaking to really notice - however the chef sent over a mini course for us (complimentary) of a cauliflower pur√©e with muscles. This unexpected course was actually the best delight of the entire night. It was as my girlfriend said, ""one of the lightest and most flavorful dishes"" she's ever had! 

As an entree we I had wagyu beef with all kinds of locally foraged mushrooms and fingerling potatoes and my girlfriend had salmon with beets. Both were wonderful. 

The whole experience, including desserts was well worth the money and time. Most importantly, I'd encourage trusting the chef with the tasting menu and follow the recommendations of the staff! They won't lead you astray. Hats off to this restaurant for a wonderful first dinner in Portland."
273,"Recently breakfasted here and what a pleasant romp. The decor, design & architecture are a feast for the eyes. Our Bloody Mary was perfectly balanced. The service was prompt and friendly. My hash was unique & delicious. A tad pricey at the end but worth every penny! Will definitely be back!"
274,"We come for cocktails in a lovely environment, and have enjoyed it each time. Sometimes we come on a date night, sometime with friends. The drinks are always lovely, and the space is particularly nice. The art in display can't be beat - Erin Hutton's typewriter installation, Matt Hutton's incredible woodworked table, and other contemporary artists are on display. 

*update for brunch*

They don't serve their full breakfast menu on Sunday mornings, and their brunch menu is limited and upscale. 

Excellent coffee and espresso. The decor is very modern, somewhat industrial and very appealing. The kitchen is open and you can watch them cook and expedite. 

I had the Brioche Galette with goat cheese, sundried tomato, an over easy egg, shaved speck, and asparagus. Very rich and flavorful. 

The spouse had the arugula salad (no nuts) and added salmon. She enjoyed it, which is good as there were not a lot of gluten free options on the brunch menu."
275,One of my favorite restaurants in Portland. Always a vegan or vegetarian option. Amazing service always love our servers!! Roomy and not crowded.
276,"My boyfriend and I were very excited to try the hot new restaurant ""Union"" and stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday. We walked into the restaurant which is part of a hotel and waited at the host stand for someone to seat us or just greet us. 

The restaurant was empty except for a 3 top in the dining room. We didn't see a hostess, a waitress or bartender. After several minutes, a bartender (or barback?) appeared and started pouring ice into the bar directly in front of us. He didn't not look up, doesn't say hello, and doesn't acknowledge our existence at all. I see the chef and make eye contact, but he quickly returns to what he's doing.

We patiently wait even longer watching the bartender unload ice and not look at us. After waiting another several minutes, we start to feel completed ignored and contemplate leaving, which we never do. Having come from the restaurant industry, we can make a lot of excuses, but this was unacceptable. 

We walk out with a feeling no customer should ever have, unwelcome. I get that this place is super fancy now, but this is no way to treat any customer, especially ones that would have dined well and probably would have come back if it was as good as they say. 

I guess we'll never know. Good luck getting noticed at this place.

277,"I apologize in advance for the novel, but I want you, reader, to know just how incredible this meal, and very special night, was. 

Saturday evening my fianc√© (though she didn't know it yet) sat down for our dinner at Union. First off, given that I'd be proposing at the end of that meal I'd been in close communication with the staff in making arrangements so that this meal would be perfect, and it needs to be said that they were incredibly accommodating and kind through the whole process. 
To that effect, when we walked in, we were met by a very friendly host who led us to our table, where a bottle of delicious sparkling ros√© was waiting, chilling, for us. Our server, was bubbly and informative, quickly and easily answered all of our questions and smoothly transitioned us into our meal. 
The first course was a season cheese plate that featured a cloth bound cheddar, a mild yet dynamic bleu, and this incredible triple creme whose name I sadly can't remember (even sadder now that I realize I can't track it down to buy without a name), a fig jam, whipped local honey, and toasted walnuts. That bleu was delicious, but the triple creme was easily one of the most delicious cheeses I've consumed, with the ash line running through its center adding a delightful smokiness. 
After the cheeses we ordered the caramelized lamb belly served over white beans, toasted pistachios, and roasted garlic pur√©e, and all I can say is that if a mouth could orgasm, it would with this dish. The lamb's belly was wound like a pinwheel and had a delightful, sweet, crisp to its outside before you make it to the buttery, herbed, and lightly gamey inner layers. The beans were sweet and earthy and were beautifully complimented by the warmth of the pistachios, and the garlic pur√©e was just that perfect extra touch that tied it all together. 
The mains were equally decadent, flavorful, and intricate. I ordered the chef's interpretation of a Surf 'n turf: seared scallops with braised ox tail, roasted shallots, and some sort of a pea pur√©e. Magic. Pure magic. The brine of the scallops melded perfectly with the grounded sweetness of the ox tail, as the smokey, near caramel, notes of the roasted shallots balanced any remaining bite of the other flavors. All in all, an absolutely incredible dish!
Last but not least, dessert. Having just proposed after the last dish, the restaurant brought out a small, yet decadent, plate of treats for us. At the bottom was a truly out-of-this world chocolate cake. Stacked above that was a bar of semi-frozen chocolate moussed that was airy and dissolved on your tongue; next to those two was a shard of cocoa-nib meringue, jutting from a dollop of fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream. Each element on its own was delicious, but the real fun came in combining them in various configurations. Additionally, the desserts were paired with a lovely sweet Argentinian dessert wine, much like a port, but cleaner. 

All in all, between the extraordinary staff, and equally incredible food, Union is a culinary experience that no one should miss, and is particularly well suited to those who want a romantic, and truly special, night to remember."
278,"Stopped into Union for lunch with coworkers and was very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was dead, which made me nervous since that usually means it isn't that good but that was not the case whatsoever. The five of us, who were here for work for a week and ate at several different spots, all agreed that this was one of our favorite lunch spots. I got the chicken panini with kale pesto and it was absolutely delicious. The foccacia bread it came on was fresh and soft. As a side I got the fingerling fries, which were also delicious.

Service is a little slow but that's what you expect at a hotel restaurant typically anyway. Between the slower service, and the locally produced maine sodas, which I found very odd tasting, it is a solid four stars for me."
279,"I love this restaurant! The first time we came was opening week when they had a limited menu. It was great then, but it is even better now! I have a house on Peaks Island and get into Portland a lot during the summer. How this magnificent restaurant continues to stay under the radar amazes me. Great atmosphere, inspired cuisine and excellent service. No crowds, few tourists, no hype and a terrific value.
UNION never disappoints! The solid kitchen team cranks out delicious farm to table fare that is fresh and interesting. The food at UNION rivals Eventide, Central Provisions and Fore Street. Every staff member is well trained and professional, great wine list, tasty drink menu and a generous pour from the bar. My daughter and I decided to share 2 entrees and waiter took note, the kitchen split plated for us, and our already good experience got even better.
Do not come to Portland and miss this elegant dining experience. When you need a culinary oasis UNION is your spot."
280,"The food was utterly fantastic and the wait staff was very kind. We ordered a bunch of stuff to try a few different things, with the intention of taking the left over food home. Apparently this isn't an option here as they gathered our plates, stacked them on each other and then threw our food away without asking. I wanted my food. Very Weird."
281,"We enjoyed a great breakfast at Union this morning. Ordering oatmeal and fruit seemed rather mundane, though we wondered what ""homemade raisins"" might offer. The raisins, along with the berries, were amazingly flavorful. The blueberry muffin had a nice crisp top and loads of blueberries.  And the service from Leonard? Truly outstanding. He was attentive, but also fun and energetic and truly helpful in giving us sightseeing hints.  Union and The Press Hotel are well worth the visit!"
282,"May have been our favorite meal in Portland. We tried all sorts of apps and split out Cod dinner which was excellent. The Crab pasta app was incredible, probably the highlight of the evening. You also must get the brussel sprouts as a large side, more than enough to share among 2-4 ppl."
283,"Came here for breakfast , we were looking for something light after a night of drinking and we got the exact breakfast we were looking for. Avocado toast was ripe and well seasoned. The simple beginning had fresh fruit although the croissant, ham and cheese chunks wasn't a complete meal in my opinion. On a normal day I feel this type of breakfast would leave me hungry for more but on that day it fit the mood."
284,"Dreadful food.  Attractive decor. Fishy pasta. Bready ""lobster"" roll with little lobster. Food tasted old, uninspired, yet pretentious. Eggs Benedict:  eggs undercooked, Hollandaise congealed (it did not flow) and sparse. Strange servers."
285,"Second visit one year on, and again our meal was delicious. Good lamb starter and duck for main course were excellent. On a 'white out snow storm' evening the place was surprisingly full, and the staff were delightful. Good bottle of Barbera... 

Still excellent it has no bloody TV's!"
286,"The food was good and diverse. The small plates are very tempting and delicious so we went for those instead of the large plates. The cheese and charcuterie boards are large and tasty. The pork belly is tender and flavorful. The service is not the greatest. Our server would disappear where we couldn't see her to get her attention. Parking is expensive, which is a given for the location, so the best bet is the lot across the street. Debating on returning."
287,Waited 20 minutes for drinks with an empty bar.  Don't visit the union if u want good service.  Charcuterie at $22 was more nuts and olives than meat and cheese.  Won't be returning to the Union anytime soon.
288,"Amazing. We had the hardest time finding a place to eat brunch on New Year's Day without having to wait hours, but the Union got us right in. Even if we had to wait, the bar was big, and there were plenty of beautiful couches and chairs right next to the bar with a gorgeous view. 
They catered to my gluten free needs spectacularly. I had the first gluten free Eggs Benedict of my life, and it was superb. Delicious bloodys and mimosas. The staff was super  helpful and polite. 
We left full and satisfied, absolutely no complaints."
289,"This restaurant is my new favorite! The food couldn't be more amazing. And the wait 
staff was better than I've ever experienced. Their suggestion for wine was spot on. The special shrimp dish of the night had umami flavors that were indescribable! And the desserts were just plain joyful! Have the plate of confections - or the peach ice cream sandwich!   And if you want a perfect night, book a room at The Press Hotel, where the restaurant is located, so you can have a leisurely evening and not have far to go when it it over!"
290,"This was probably the best dining experience of my life. My boyfriend and I were in Portland for our anniversary and let the restaurant know on their online reservation form. They went way above ""above and beyond"" helping make our night special. They sat us at the chef's table, where we were treated to glasses of champagne and two delicious appetizers. We got the burrata with roasted squash and pumpkin butter, which I honestly did not want to ever be finished because it was so delicious. The chef and manager checked in on us often, chatted with us and made us feel like they genuinely wanted us and the other patrons to have a memorable and enjoyable time at their restaurant. I got the hanger steak which was out of this world, and my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about his rabbit. Thank you so much to the staff at Union for making our evening so wonderful and for the absolutely OUTSTANDING food!"
291,"One of the best breakfasts I've had, period. The raisins that come with the oatmeal are made in house. Eggs Benedict were done flawlessly. Decor is crisp yet not cold. What a pleasant experience. In The Press Hotel, which is worth a visit if only to see the wall of typewriters and other newspaper relics."
292,"Excellent execution of breakfast. Avocado toast was fantastic. Smoked Salmon and accoutrements were very good. Flannel hash was OK. Eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, though the lobster add-on not worth the extra $12. Would come back for lunch or dinner."
293,"This has been our favorite meal in Portland so far, both for the wonderful service and the delectable dinner we had here. 

The flash-seared tuna was the best dish of the night, and the scallops were a close-second. The burrata dish was also delicious, paired with the great olive oil and fresh spring peas. 

Pair that with the well-crafted cocktails, good wine, and cheese plate to finish and this place gets our seal of approval. 

PS- Sarah was the best waitress ever!"
294,"This restaurant is in a hotel. Why do I start my review with that qualifier?  I'm not sure, just as I'm not sure why all restaurants in a hotel have a certain feel. They just do. There is a certain formula that combines trendiness with blandness and spits out the quintessential hotel restaurant that serves food good enough to get by in middle America but not for the exceptional food scene that is Portland, ME. 

It's not bad, it's just not great. And that's the issue, in a city of food greatness, this just doesn't measure up. 

P.S. The food was cold."
295,"We stopped at Union before a show at the Merrill Auditorium for drinks and hors d'oeuvres. Amazing food the truffle laced potato chips were sublimely simple. The ""Cheese and Charcuterie"" (the Chef's seasonal selection of local cheeses and artisan meats along with local honey, fig jam, walnuts, and bread) flavorful. Finally, the bartender was very thoughtful in his drink preparation. A great visit."
296,"Lovely lunch today. First time -staff very accommodating and friendly.  Truffle chips were excellent-salads all fresh with nice variety of ingredients.  Bright and inviting atmosphere.  Had the added pleasure of watching a wedding party go across the street to City Hall. Our waiter told us there is still a ""tunnel"" bit not useable-what fun that would be to explore underground Portland??"
297,"Awesome new addition to the Portland dining scene!  The decor is modern, open and fun, and the crowd appeared to be a mix of young hipsters, hotel guests, middle-aged foodies, and local professionals.  The menu was both incredibly creative and wholly welcoming.  Plenty of interesting choices, but nothing fully ""expected.""  We started with two perfectly made cocktails, fresh and obviously with local ingredients.  Moved on to their wines by the glass list, which avoids the cliche brands and has some well-priced, interesting options.  

For appetizers, we had the local burrata -- a creamy, delicious mozzarella served with thin crisps and freshly shelled peas; and the clean-tasting ""compressed peaches"" salad which included cured ham and kale.  Main courses were exceptional.  My wife loved the steak -- cooked perfectly medium rare, then sliced and served with an earthy combination of trumpet mushrooms and fingerling potatoes.  The gold star, however, went to the confit of lamb leg, served with heirloom carrots.  The flavor was spectacular:  almost caramelized, with a touch of sweetness mixed with lightly salted meatiness.  Holy yum-ness!  The service was super professional and responsive, and the whole team worked together to support each other.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of this creative, comfortable menu!"
298,Beautiful meal! Had the cleanse drink no ice to start. Followed by the hash and the corn fritters.
299,This place has nice atmosphere... the chef is amazing. The staff is warm and friendly. The duck I had was cooked to perfection. The sauce for the duck was not too sweet with just the right hints of orange. Worth every penny and not cheap but you don't leave engorged with food so you can still enjoy dessert which they have. I recommend the chocolate pudding!
300,"Came here on a chilly late spring Thursday night with some co-workers and clients. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Local 188 has plenty of private off-street parking, a nice bonus for this neighborhood.

The parking also helps given that the interior is surprisingly large - with a good sized, corner bar on the left facing the street and a large yet cozy dining area. The open kitchen and dark wood makes the space feel more intimate and the size helps with noise and space.

The host and server were both friendly, and the food was all delivered quickly and plated quite nicely. We went with a selection of tapas due to our large mixed group size, though I'm definitely going back to sample some of the dinner-sized dishes as many of them looked great.

I'm not a mussels fan but our table raved about the size of the dish and quality, and the ones I did try -- the pita and goat cheese croquetes - were both above average, with fresh light flavors that worked well together.

Drinks were perfectly made across the board (I got a rye mule that I recommend), though we could've received a bit more regular check-ins there. 

Finally, while I wasn't overly excited at the desert menu selections, our entire group ordered the Crema Catalonia so I joined in. The menu describes it as ""vanilla custard, earl grey, orange confit, fennel jam, lemon poppy shortbread"", and while it was a fresh, lightly sweet and nicely portioned finish to the meal, I do recommend they make their menu description a bit less clever and a bit more direct. You're receiving a small cup of custard with a fennel jam layer on top and an earl gray-infused layer on bottom alongside two thin lemon poppyseed wafers. 

All-in-all this is a place with a sizeable, mixable menu, a warm atmosphere, and friendly service. I'll be back again to try some more cocktail options and see what their meal portion menu has to offer."
301,"Yet again, Portland's long lines indicate popular brunches with accuracy. 

The inside of Local 188 is larger than I expected because Portland restaurants are notoriously tiny. It's got charm but I honestly can't identify the style of the place. Maybe classy grandfather chic?

Get an iced chai latte. It's lightly spicy and a great way to start out brunch here. 

The sausage and biscuits main dish is so hearty, perfect for a rainy autumn morning. Sausage is less Jimmy Dean spices and more modern breakfast sausage in flavor, but there's gotta be a half pound of meat in that dish. The two biscuits are dense, moist, and incredibly well suited for the gravy they swim in. Two thumbs up. 

The special of the day was an ham, mozzarella and green onion omelette/scramble. Also megatasty."
302,"Well, count me as disappointed. Local 188 was my favorite brunch place for years. A cool bohemian vibe with great egg scrambles, drinks and free parking, this was my go-to brunch spot. $5 mimosas were a Portland bargain and the long waits were worth it.

Fast forward to 2019 and things have changed. Hot Suppa is clearly the king of brunch on Congress St., and Local barely even has waits anymore. Now I see why. Those $5 mimosas slowly crept to $6, and then $7 over the years. Now it's $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a Bloody Mary, which is perhaps the worst value in the city (though the Bloody's are excellent). And the mimosas have pulp, if that's not your thing.

But worse than the downgrade in drinks is the food. Most dishes come with home fries, and my scramble came with an abundance. Four. So did my companions'. Four home fries!!! Did the chef or server eat the rest? I figured it had to be an off day until some friends went a day later. They got three home fries. I'm pretty sure this isn't the Great Famine. And the scramble itself was far smaller than in the past and ordinary. Only the thick english muffin with the perfect raspberry jam was satisfying. 

I just can't recommend Local anymore. The drinks and meals are overpriced for what you get. Portland still isn't a great brunch city, but you can do better."
303,"We started by waiting 45 minures for a table.   That was our choice so that's ok. Then we waited 10 minutes to order. Ok.. then waited over an hour for our food. Not ok. I asked the waitress about our food and she snapped, ""it's obviously busy today. "" Going downhill fast. 5 of us got our food and the 6 th waited another 10 minutes for her order. Unacceptable. 
The food was average at best, undercooked to be accurate. The service was completely indifferent. 
I would never go back . Too many other good places nearby. Vote with your feet."
304,"Popped into this restaurant for dinner in Portland. I came specifically for the seafood paella, so I can't speak to the tapas here. 

The seafood paella: IMPORTANT: THIS DISH IS A 30 MIN WAIT. We were seated right away, and even though there were only a few customers, we were told right away that the paella is a 30-40 min wait. I was ok with that since there was nothing else I wanted on the menu. I'd say it was worth the wait since we weren't in a hurry. I'm not sure if you can call ahead and get the order going before arriving at the restaurant. 

The dish came out piping hot with lots of mussels, clams, but few scallops, shrimps, and pieces of dish of the day. The scallops, jumbo shrimps, and white fish were absolutely amazing. Mussels and clams were small and shriveled. The rice was cooked well. For $39, the portions were more than enough for 2 people. 

The space: Beautiful, spacious, but very dimly lit. Definitely a romantic atmosphere conducive for fancy date nights. 

The service: Very friendly, no complaints. 

The wait: Tuesday night in September, only a few tables were occupied. Again, at least 30 min wait for the paella even with the few customers. 

Overall, would recommend if you're into paella. Not sure what the tapas experience is like."
305,"I have been here three times in the last year, the first time, the male bartender made an amazing drink for me based on my love of rum and fruit. I was sold. The whole night was amazing. I left feeling like I had a great experience. 

The second time was a month ago and the same thing! Amazing drinks. Friendly atmosphere. Comfy. Wonderful experience. 

The third time tonight was also consistently amazing. I highly recommend this place. Tonight was the first time I have ever eaten here. We had the Montadito, Potatas Bravas and Roasted Chicken. 

I didn't expect the Montadito to be as delicious as it was.  The boyfriends pick. He picks well. Blindly though, he knows very little about food. Haha. 

The Potatas Bravas was good. We asked the bartender what she liked and that is what she said. I would have loved if the potatos had a more salty crust and if the garlic aoili had a maple flavor in it.

Could have just been me but the whole meal lacked a sweetness that I expect in December. 

The roasted chicken was good as well but I personally would have added a sweet flavor which I think they tried to do with the apricot tomato salsa which wasn't my fav. I noticed after that I had none of the carrots on my plate which might be why I felt like this was missing something. 

But honestly. Everything looks delicious. I saw and smelt the Risotto and that looks SO epic. I also saw the gnocchi and that looked really yum too! 

I will update my review when I do brunch which I heard was banging!"
306,"This review is for brunch only.

For the positives:
- We got a table outside which was so lovely on a nice sunny morning
- Good location and easy to find parking
- Brunch burger was delicious

For the not-so-positives:
- Service took forever
- The breakfast sandwich was on the same bun as the burger so while eating it, I really felt like I was missing out since my dining companion had the burger lol...served on their biscuit, this would have been A+
- There was a gentleman at the table (for 4) next to us...he may have been the owner, but was being a bit bossy to the server and made me feel awkward

I think I'd come back for dinner and even for brunch (but ordering something different!!)"
307,"I am tempted to list the 188 reasons I love this place but I honestly don't have the time plus who wants to read a review that long?

How about top  six reasons? 

1. The food is delicious.  By that I mean yum yum yummy.  Everything we ordered was done right.

2. Service was warm and inviting.

3. Menu is inventive and full of interesting choices.  You can order a main dish or eat more in a tapas style.  I adore sharing dishes so always opt for tapas and the dishes had decent portions and were reasonably priced.  The menu items were creative but also well executed (see item 1 above).

4.  Atmosphere can accommodate an intimate evening with a ""special"" friend or a more casual night out with friends.

5.  Cocktails!  Lovely selection of interesting and yummy cocktails.  I couldn't drink them all (yet) but they all looked positively scrummy (I may be watching too much Great British Baking shows....).

6.  I hear they serve a fantastic brunch.  I haven't actually tried it yet, but I love me a good brunch."
308,"A solid 4.5 stars! I loved all the different small plates, and my mint cocoa! 

Although I do wish they offered some other non alcoholic drinks! Like maybe some kombucha! I think it'd be a great pairing."
309,"Pretty good food, beautiful drinks for brunch. Their breakfast paella is fun and flavorful- could use more spice but a great meal and takes about 20 mins. Their service is overall very unorganized and slow. Took forever to be seated despite many many open tables and we were asked to leave the bar area even though nobody else wanted to sit there. Their corn beef hash is not as tender as I'd want and their eggs and legs are ok only because of the grits and biscuit side. The chicken itself isn't crispy enough. Overall good experience, beautiful dining area, delicious fruity drinks try the honeysuckle but only go if you're not in a rush."
310,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

Atmosphere was cosy and classy.

Staff were friendly and seemed to actually enjoy their job. All the smiles!

The wine and food. Wow. Yummy bread with oil for a simple yet elegant starter to munch on while we chatted and sipped our wine. The house paella was worth the ~30 minute wait (we were warned). It was so freaking delicious! 

I am extremely impressed with this restaurant. Highly recommend!"
311,"In the past, I had only been to Local 188 for nightly cocktails, however, recently my husband and I tried Local 188 for their weekend brunch. 

Want to know the best thing about brunch at Local 188? No. Waits. (typically...). Because Local 188 has an abundance of seating, they are able to seat people regularly without a wait, which is something that I can appreciate. We went to Local 188 around 9:30am, where every other place else had extensive wait times, but we were seated right away. 

As we were seated, we were greeted by our waitress, who was incredibly friendly and nice. My husband and I got a bloody Mary while our friend got the mimosa, all of which were appropriately priced. $8 for a bloody? Sign. Me. Up! Their menu provided a lot of great, unique options, as well as some original staples. My husband got the huevos rancheros, I got the winter scramble, and our friend ordered the breakfast sandwich, but he asked for it on a biscuit instead. 

My husband and friend loved their meals, while I seemed to just like mine. In the winter scramble, there were chunks of butternut squash with egg and cheese. It was good, but I just wish it had a little more oomph to it. However, the bloody Mary was really well-made and had a nice kick to it. 

We will definitely be back to Local 188 for their brunch options, and it's a great place to skip the long waits of other brunch places in the area!"
312,"One of the best places I've been to:
- Funny staff.
- Lots of tables.
- Great street view.
- Dim lights make quite an atmosphere.
- The best food and fanciest menus I've seen.
- Their chicken is to die for!
- Very good food prices."
313,"I cannot say enough amazing things about this place. The food was some of the best brunch we have ever had! The place was pretty busy, yet service was really attentive. I got the breakfast sandwich and home fries, cooked perfectly on the thickest English muffin. He got the corned beef hash that was packed with flavor. Everyone should order the ricotta fritters they were insanely delicious. We left feeling so full and happy, a must return!"
314,"I don't wait in brunch lines. I just don't. I get hangry and then impatient, which leads to rapid food consumption. However, I paced myself. I loaded up on blueberries and coffee to sit in line at local 188 for brunch. It even rained on us. 

But totally worth the wait. We got the bacon breakfast sandwich and the mushroom goat cheese spinach scramble. We both went silent when the food arrived as we Hoover vacuummed the deliciousness. Good value and price for brunch. It's worth the wait."
315,"Loved this place. Went here by accident due to the very scare parking situation. They have their own parking area in the back. 

This restaurant is huge! It's also very homey, with sofas for seats and old varied mugs, giving this place a very authentic living room feel.

Loved their food, price was decent. Waitor situation was interesting. We didn't have one waiter assigned and took awhile to get water to the table, but overall solid low key food experience."
316,"Dear Local 188,

Thank you for being a dream restaurant for Saturday breakfast for families! I almost don't want to write this review for fear of word getting out... but here goes.

To all the parents out there: Picture this, it's Saturday morning and you don't want to cook breakfast, but your two kiddos are hungry and cannot possibly wait in line for breakfast. You hop in the mini-van and drive downtown while you debate your options, and remember there really is no debate. You pull into THE PARKING LOT and have no trouble claiming one of the open spots. Your crew of 4 skip up the path to the front door of Local 188 where the host greets you and seats you immediately. They have two highchairs ready and offer paper for the kids to color. There is almost instantly hot coffee in your mug and soy milk available, as preferred. You have plenty of leg room, and while there are a few others dining, it is quiet. You place your order and are quickly served eggs with local veggies and the best homemade English Muffin with a side of jam and hollandaise (savory & sweet, please). Your kids are still entertained, your coffee is refilled (twice), the jam is slightly sweet and the hollandaise perfectly creamy, and you are humbled by how easy Saturday breakfast can be. One note: you'll notice I did not use the word brunch, as we eat solidly in the 'breakfast' zone.

I can promise other moms out there: the combination of free off-street parking, plenty of seating, and a simple yet delicious menu provides the perfect breakfast for families. I also appreciate that there are vegetarian options, the big bathroom with a changing table, and the causal, laid-back atmosphere. Yes, it's hipster, but Local 188, you will forever have a place in my heart for family breakfast.

I've been for dinner/tapas too (before kids) and while not the most memorable (maybe I'm just tired), it was a crowd pleaser! Deviled eggs, yes please."
317,I was a bit underwhlemed by Local 188. I went with the paella and it was too much food with too little seasoning. The menu is rather expensive and rather small. I might go back as evidently the brunch service is popular. But I was not blown away.
318,Delicious ... the gnocchi with the beet pur√©e - unexpected and nearly spectacular. Lovely server. Nice vibe. If I lived in Portland - I'd be a regular.
319,"Brunch, people.  Seriously.  We love the brunch here - every time we're in town, we make a point to brunch out here.  Today was no exception.  The food is fantastic.  We had the mushroom scramble special, which included an amazing english.  What's the big deal, its just an english, you say?  Nope.  Epic.  Also had legs & eggs which is a confit, then fried chicken thigh (yes, really), little pot of cheesy grits, coupla eggs and a delicious, flaky biscuit the size of my head.  I needed a moment alone with that biscuit, lemme tell ya.  And then, in order to ensure weight gain, we shared the blueberry pancake.  Are you picturing a delicious stack?  It's not that at all, but roughly 1Kx better.  It's a pancake-y, cornbread-ish cake, baked in an exuberantly buttered little skillet, then anointed with blueberry compote. (i was watching)

If you can, try to get a seat at the counter by the open kitchen and watch these zen masters do their magic.  The staff are delightful, the food wonderful.  Go hungry and enjoy the funky vibe and fantastic food.  But don't get between me and my biscuit, k?"
320,Amazing brunch. Great eclectic vibe. I don't normally believe in hocus locus Mumbai jumbo but Paella breakfast? Yes
321,"Atmosphere: super cool. I love how there's couches in the middle of the restaurant. It's a real wholesome vibe. They have plants everywhere and the lighting is pretty dim. 

Food: we got the goat cheese appt., and that was spectacular. The cheese was on point, warm and creamy. It had tomatoes mixed in which gave it such a refreshing finish. I got the house paella, which to be honest, was a little bland. I had to add some pepper and hot sauce to add some flavor. Maybe I just really enjoy flavor, but no biggie it was still pretty good. 

Beer list: Plenty to choose from. I got the coffee milk stout and that was so good. 

Service: wonderful. 

Tip: there's a parking lot in the back! Yay!"
322,"We initially were trying to get into a brunch place nearby, but had to make it quick to get to the airport after. So instead of waiting, we went over to Local 188.

It's a huge space that looks like a mix of a cafe, restaurant, and a small bar. The breakfast and coffee was delicious and we loved being able to see the open concept kitchen as they prepared meals. 

I am not exaggerating when I say this was the best sausage patty I've ever had! Everything was so good that I kept my leftovers and ate them on my layover several hours later. 

My reasons for knocking down the star is because they opened fairly late for breakfast (9am?) so there was a line out front. Additionally, the concept is a bit all over the place with so much conflicting decor, vibes, menus, etc."
323,"What a great place! Eclectic and fun vibe/bar seats, tables or couches-take your pick. Food was  fresh and delicious-olives, flatbread and hummus. Drinks were made well and service was outstanding! Will definitely return next time we're in Portland."
324,"With only one night in Portland, we settled on this restaurant for dinner on a recent Sunday.  Free parking is available immediately behind the restaurant.  The spacious interior features a large bar, upholstered furniture, open kitchen and local art hanging from the walls.  We began by sharing an asparagus and grilled corn salad that included local feta, toasted hazelnuts, radishes and herb vinaigrette. This was soon followed by seared shrimp with arugula, heirloom tomatoes, bacon and avocado puree. Both dishes were delicious, but portion sizes were small in comparison to their respective price tags.  Such was not the case with the house paella that included clams, mussels, chicken and chourico. It proved to be both bountiful and delicious with a desirable amount of socarrat.  We could not and did not finish though a Herculean effort was made."
325,"I only came here for cocktails one evening and had a fabulous experience. I've actually never even heard of this place until a friend brought us here one night.

This is a really cool place with a very open concept. As soon as you walk in, the entire back of the restaurant is the kitchen which is visible to all guests. It even offers a bar style seating for those to enjoy their meals and watch the cooks. There are many tables situated throughout the restaurant with some couches in the middle for some lounging, waiting and cocktails.

The bar is situated to your left when you walk in. The bar also offers some additional seating for those who prefer to sit at the bar or to just get a drink.

We only took a look at the drink menu which was very extensive. Their drink menu was actually separated by type of alcohol which I thought was really cool. I ended up ordering a chocolate strawberry martini which was absolutely delicious. The other drinks within our party were also very good. There is definitely something on the menu for everyone!

As we sat with our drinks, I couldn't help but stare at all of the food that was being brought out. Everything looked delicious! 

I can't wait to return for another chocolate strawberry martini and to try out some of the food options!"
326,"Local 188 is one of the rights of passage to visit to be able to say ""Yes, I'm a Portland local."" 

When you walk in the door, you can expect to see an eclectic style. From couches and chairs to bar stools to family tables. The bar will always be busy. You can sit at a counter that looks into the kitchen; it's completely open. 

My experiences here have varied over time. The one constant-- the food is something you can always count on. 

Brunch can get really busy, so be prepared to wait. The bar is always open! 

There are two ways to eat when coming to local 188--tapas style or order your own dish. 

The deviled eggs are a staple, so you must try them. The gnocchi is always a solid dish, as is the risotto. I wasn't that impressed with the roasted chicken in my most recent visit. 

They do take reservations, so if you're coming at a busy time of day, you should definitely try to make one."
327,"Wow. These are not your average pancakes. I would say that this was the best pancake I've ever eaten, but to call this a pancake would be wrong. They're a similar taste and consistency to corn bread, but fluffier. Shrouding the warm heavenly interior is a crispy sugar coated exterior, almost like the top of cr√®me br√ªl√©e. The sugary surface made the pancake taste as though I was eating a sugar cookie in ""pancake"" form. Order one, and I promise that you'll devour the entire thing.

$9.00 for a pancake may seem outrageous, but it's thick, huge, and so delicious that I'd gladly pay double the price. 

Lastly, this is a prime brunching spot. It'll take a while to get a seat, but the quirky, hipster atmosphere will keep your mind occupied while you wait for your stellar food."
328,Amazing brunch place. Had the breakfast burrito and it was to die for. They wifey ordered the autumn scramble and it was tough for me to decide which one I liked better. Great latte as well and fairly creative coffee-alcoholic drinks (did not taste though)
329,"Went here for brunch and I wasn't impressed. Menu is very limited, but the autumn scramble sounded delicious.
It was actually barely edible, smothered in salt and cheese...was there actually squash in this as described? You couldn't even taste the egg, more less the squash. I had to send it back, which was returned marginally better. Coffee wasn't even palatable. After dumping cream until it was cold, it was still muddy brown and tasted it could fuel my gas tank. If you are going to serve breakfast, at least get the coffee right. That isn't difficult. I am only giving this place 3 stars because my husband enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, and the server was really nice. She was the best part of my experience."
330,Noise level:basketball court. Service: excellent.  Food: Burned. I ordered the Scallops entre. The scallops were slightly burned but the Brussels sprouts that came with them were charred. Buried within each sprout was a cubic centimeter sized pleasant tasting unburned morsel. I complained to the waitress and she apologized and brought me a replacement bowl of Brussels sprouts but all of them were also burned!  My husband ordered paella. The seafood and chicken were good but the rice was burned. It was all very disappointing. We are not going there again.
331,"Meh. I enjoyed their drinks. I like the atmosphere. It is a good place for friends to drink and hang.
But found the food unremarkable. The paella lacked flavor, but with a good amount of chorizo. And everything else we did have wasn't so delicious that i remembered it. I remember yummy food, always. This place was lacking for me."
332,We were in town for the weekend. Asked the hotel for breakfast places and they suggested Becky's and this place. Boy are we glad Becky's had a half hour wait. This place was next. 20 minute wait. What a cool place. A little funky but the breakfast was one one of the best I had since going to Montreal 15 years ago. The English muffin was so hearty and tasty. The eggs super fresh. Thick cut bacon. Coffee very good. Waitress was great. No hiccups here. Wish we had tried the homemade sausage and the huevos rancheros. Sounded great. Parking was tough but it was a Sunday so we figured it out. Didn't take pictures because we ate our food so fast. Awesome. Keep up the good work.
333,"We had a res for 9 and were seated by 9:40. That was a bummer but the credit card system was down, it was snowing, and it was 3 hours until the new year, so the delay was understandable. The food was great. We got the chicken livers and the seafood paella. The livers were so delicious. The creamy sauce paired with the crunchy nuts was so good, you forget your eating an iron bomb (score 1 for the anemic). The seafood paella overall was great but for how long it took the rice was a bit dry once it got to us. Had the rice been mixed and a bit more saucey, this dish would have been 10/10. The seafood had great variety (Portland knows how to catch em), and seemed super fresh. Great drinks, definitely goin back."
334,"What a great brunch. The menu was incredible and hard to pick just one item. So we shared. The grits, though not true southern were fantastic. 

The egg menu offers all types. The Winter Scramble hit the spot. Brie and squash wow! 
We say the pancake item which was more like a poundcake. The women eating was not complaining and left nothing. 

We will have to be back again try other options. 

My mom had the biscuits and gravy. Wow!  Yes I had  a taste. 

Now the drinks. So many options of Bloody Mary's. And coffee. The Alarm clock was the piece of resistance.  Wow. Had that after the meal. Not sure I will sleep for two days. 

If you have never been I strongly suggest you give it a try. Portland is so lucky to have so many food options.   The good news is that we also have a lot of gym options too."
335,Decent food. A little off the wall (hipster) and great if you're into that kind of thing. My girlfriend and I went in for the first time while visiting Portland looking for a good Bloody Mary. I don't mind a little heat along with the Bloody Mary but these things were HOT. Basically too hot for either one of us to finish. Probably won't go back because of the prices and how freakin hot the drinks are.
336,Awesome unique restaurant! We went there for seafood paella but had discovered their tapas was great as well especially the mushroom and chicken liver! I love the relax ambiance and antique furnitures.
337,"Meh. This place is convenient, and they know it. It's wicked expensive for bland food.

I think they have the upper hand because they have more tables and can seat more hungry/hangry people than the other nearby joints, but they take too much of an advantage of it. The servings are tiny, the food is usually flavorless, and the service is usually people that are so busy they can't properly do their jobs. (Friendly servers, but not enough of them.)

This is a harsh review, but it's because this place is lacking hard on professionalism and quality. If their food matched their prices (my boyfriend and I had breakfast for $50!), then it'd be acceptable. But it's not worth coming here."
338,Very good food and have they're own infusions for cocktails.  I was in Portland for 5 days and ended up here twice definitely recommend
339,"I kind of generally avoid Local 188 because it always seems to have a wait outside.  
Recently, when planning to meet with some friends for breakfast, I suggested it, thinking if we got there early enough, it wouldn't be too packed.  We arrived the following (Saturday) morning at 9:30, and my hunch worked!  While we were certainly not the first people there, there was no wait for a table and we were seated right away at a comfortable table for 4!
Local 188 has a homey feel.  Tables are organized well for comfort and privacy and there is a cozy couch cluster for people wanting that kind of thing.

I ordered some kind of a honeybee brunch cocktail, which was pretty spectacular and my daughter picked the biscuits and honey butter as an app.  The biscuits were ok, not the best part of the meal and the butter did not taste of honey at all.  On the other hand, unflavored butter is still pretty good!  

Honestly, the biscuits were good, and might be considered great in another location.  Unfortunately, Local is across the street (sort of) from Tandem who make biscuits that are  insanely delicious outliers.  This town has an extremely competitive biscuit game!
I kind of wanted to order the pastry of the day, but dammit!, didn't want to risk disappointment again!

Anyway, I ordered the mushroom and herb scramble and my daughter ordered the corned beef hash.  My eggs were great, seasoned really well and served with potatoes (crisp!) and rye toast.  My daughter loved the hash and commented on the positivity of the crispy home fries as well!  Our brunch companions really liked their main dishes as well.

We had an attentive, helpful server and did not feel rushed in any way!

Another plus is that there is parking for the restaurant behind the building and if you get there by 9:30, spaces will probably still be available!

When we left, there was a MUCH longer line to get in (so much of life is about timing!).  
When walking back to my car, I realized how much I enjoyed the brunch scene at Local and definitely planned to return.  
In fact, I kind of wish they would extend their brunch/breakfast days in the summer and maybe add another morning or two (Thursday and Friday???)."
340,Stopped in for breakfast after driving up from Boston.  Everyone was friendly and attentive to make sure we had a pleasant experience.  I got the Huevos Rancheros and it was delish!  Perfect with a nice sweet beverage on the side...
341,"We randomly drove past Local 188 and decided to stop for brunch. I'm so glad we did! The menu at this restaurant is small, but complete. I went with the Garlic Lover Bloody Mary (so garlicy and kind of spicy!) and the Huevos Rancheros. It was full of flavor and the right amount of food. The only thing that bummed me out when it came to the food was the grits. Skip them. They were boring and kind of hard. As a southern-born woman, this was just not acceptable.

My only complaint about this eclectic restaurant was the seating. We were seated at a window unit and felt like we were going to have heat stroke because the sun was beating on us. There were no blinds and we were not alone in feelings of death. Our window bar buddies were having the same problem. Get some blinds Local 188!"
342,Amazing garlic lovers Bloody Mary mmmmmm. Went in on a Sunday early afternoon; it was pretty busy but we got seats at the end of the bar. I had juevos rancheros SOOOO good.
343,"My Second time eating here and this time was even better than the first!  Six of us had the rioja with many tapas dishes:  goat cheese at gratin, patatas bravas, arugula salad, charcuterie platter, mushrooms, clams, gnocchi, chicken livers and seafood paella.  My favorite were the mushrooms but everything was so good!  Only slight disappointments were the paella and the size of the sweet corn flan.  Flans are always too small IMHO.

The other sweet surprise was getting the bill and finding our rioja was half price!  

4.5 stars"
344,"I'm going to start grading in buckets.  Drool buckets, that is.  This place is a five drool bucket experience. The breakfast paella, with safron rice, chorizo, chicken, mussels, baked eggs, was huge, and only $16!  I know it's no revelation that NYC is bullshit expensive (and almost always not worth the price), but this plate's value made me proud to be an American and almost made me cry tears of joy as my faith in humanity was being restored.  We also had the Eggs & Legs which, um...is a poultry and egg ballet dancing on your plate.  Chicken confit (a delicately and battered large drumstick), one big ass tasty homemade biscuit, and sausage gravy to boot.  I mean....COME ON! We sat at the bar, and our bartender was a gentleman, very attentive, made us feel welcomed, and never rushed.  Well done to all, at Local 188.  Oh yeah, to our delight, you also can just wait for a seat to open up at the bar and not wait for a table, which seemed to be the exception, not the rule, in Portland. In our case, in worked in our favor. Check this joint out!"
345,"Local 188 on Congress Street offers fabulous brunches, great food, an extensive drink menu and a compliment of enthusiastic folks who work at this restaurant with pride.  I have dined at Local 188 many, many time and I've never had an unsatisfying experience.  The venue has been around along time in a city of ""foodies"" who won't support those overpriced nouvelle cuisine restaurants that come and go.  Hence, their longevity bodes well for a reason to give Local 188 a try.  I am confident you won't be disappointed."
346,"Took 1 1/2 hours from the time I walked in until the time we got served. The hostess skipped over my name and 3 other groups were seated before us. When I went and asked, realizing that we were skipped, we were seated overlooking the windows. The sun was in our eyes which was unpleasant and we were forced to sit side by side instead of facing each other which made it difficult to talk.

The waitress brought me the wrong drink (it was her first day so it was a simple mistake through of chaos). At least the bloody Maria took the edge off the wait. It took about an hour to get our food from the time we ordered it. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito which was terribly bland. The simple addition of salt would have even helped tremendously. It was unpleasant to eat, the only thing that I could taste was the greasy sausage. It should absolutely be completely removed from the menu. My friend ordered the scramble special with fries that were essentially the consistency of burnt toast with little to no potato present. He asked for a fresh side and was brought more petrified potato's. The side of squash from his girlfriends plate was also raw and inedible. 

I paid $30 for my meal after tip and honestly felt like I severely wasted my money and would have had a more pleasant day had I not eaten anything at all. 

The English muffins were good though from what my friend tells me. 

My hopes are that the manager reads this and realizes that this lost him the service of 3 regular customers. Obviously the staff cannot keep us with the growing popularity of brunch. I do not see how this restaurant will remain open in such a competitive market."
347,"This is prob my favorite brunch/breakfast place in Portland. In spite of the crowd, we were seated fairly quickly. And the pre-brunch Latte and coffees made the short wait seem even shorter. Biscuits and honey butter, Huevos Rancheros, Breakfast burritos, Sausage Egg Sandwiches... AND grits. And the coffee was on the house!"
348,"If I could, I would give Local 188 3.5 stars. It was a super cute place - we sat against the wall on long benches with tons of pillows. It had something of an ambiance. The lights were low. There was - oddly enough - the soundtrack to Guardians of the Galaxy playing when we arrived. It was not unpleasant.

Our server (and those who helped him) were kind and polite. Nothing about the service was over the top fabulous - we had to ask for water a couple of times, but overall we were treated well.

The food was good! I say that with a big smile and a little too loud, like I'm convincing myself of that fact. We really loved the shrimp and garlic appetizer - it had the best flavor. There was a chevre app with crusty bread that we liked. The arugula salad was nice, but we wished there was a bit more to it. And the paealla, which I was so excited about and wanted to love, was so rice-heavy, it was hard to get through. It was also a bit on the bland side. 

Drinks were good and reasonably priced. 

To be honest, I kind of wish we'd come for brunch instead of dinner, since we'd heard great things about their brunch menu. Maybe next time we're on Portland, we'll take another swing by Local 188!"
349,"Great breakfast and brunch place.  Lots of comfy seating and a cool atmosphere.  

Get the cucumber Bloody Mary and the breakfast paella if they have it.  Regular paella but but with bacon and baked eggs.  

Awesome service and good coffee.   And parking!"
350,"Great job team! Awesome dinner. Was recommended by a local chef and he did not stir me wrong, had small plates, octopus, charcuterie, a Spanish tortilla and gnocchi. Everything was outstanding. Great flavor profiles and everyrhing was cooked perfectly. Will definitely recommend others to try. Great atmosphere and the staff were awesome. Thanks for a great dinner"
351,"I went here with a friend to celebrate the end of graduate school. Local is a fun spot to go and it's handy that there is a parking lot available. It was a Thursday so it wasn't that busy and we were able to get a table right away. 

I ordered an extra dirty martini and my friend ordered the Caribbean Mule, a play on the Moscow Mule. We ended up ordering some tapas and ate whenever they came out from the kitchen. I love the patatas bravas with garlic aioli. The potatoes were cut into much larger pieces than I've had before but I liked this because they were easier to hold on to them while dipping! I also got the deviled eggs (who doesn't love a good deviled egg?!). And my last tapa was the chicken pinchos which was grilled chicken skewers. My friend got the flatbread an hummus (a generous portion and the bread looked chewy and soft) and the mussels (choice of red or white so she went with the latter). 

Local 188 is a cool place with a variety of seating choices, benches with pillows, a large bar, a view of the kitchen, and a feeling of not being rushed to turn a table for the next diners. I like the vibe here and will definitely be back!"
352,Good American fare. Had the seafood paella which which had over cooked rice - nice presentation.
353,"Lovely service.  I was glad we made reservations for Saturday night as they were booked.  The scallop special was really tasty.  The white anchovies were good, but I wish they were served on the side of the herb bread instead of on top of it.  The kale and white bean salad was well prepared.  We loved the salty bread that came with the meal.  We did not need the olive oil on the bottom of the dish, though, some might like it. 
The grilled chicken was excellent, and the pork chop special was delicious but a bit higher priced than expected.  I should have asked the price.  Wine prices start at $22 and go up.  We enjoyed the Temprana.  We had not been to Local 188 in years.  We won't make that mistake again!"
354,"Came here for brunch and so happy I did!

The service was fantastic, the place was adorable and spacious, and the food was amazing. I got the huevos rancheros and it was honestly the best huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life. The chai latte I ordered was equally delicious and super fresh.

My friends each tried a speciality bloody mary and those looked good too. Get the biscuit with honey butter! Yum!"
355,"Brunch is the bomb here. 

The waitress had, like, sort of a 6th sense that I was borderline alcoholic on this particular morning, and she whisked away to the bar and brought me a ginormous glass of vodka. But come on, I was at brunch with my pregnant friend. I had to drink for myself, and for prego, and for prego's unborn baby. I basically had to drink for three. 

Ambiance, on fleek. Sorry if you don't like that word. Fleek, fleek, fleek, fleek, fleek, fleek.

This place has everything I like for brunch. I feel like brunch is the hipster form of breakfast. You take a regular man in flannel, he's just regular. You take a regular man in flannel and add a man bun, he's hipster. At Local 188 it's like you have your regular breakfast options, but you have plenty cool spins on the classics. 

Hipster-y, boozy, comfy, loud, open, delicious....and an overall buzzing environment with good energy."
356,This place was amazing! We stumbled unpin it because the recommended place had a long wait. Brunch was the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had and their brunch cocktails were fabulous! Definitely will be coming back to try dinner!
357,"I'm not sure why I keep coming back here except that I keep thinking certain dishes are going to be good because they sound innovative but then I'm disappointed. Some dishes are very tasty but overall I think it's hit or miss, and for the price, that's probably not great for regular visits."
358,"I don't know that I have ever had a bad meal here, but brunch is really their shining star.  Awesome mimosas and Bloody Mary's, probably the best hash in town, and enough variety for every palate.  A little pricey by Portland standards, but oh so very worth it."
359,Outstanding. Roast chicken was so tasty. It was a flavorful burst with every bite. The chocolate pots de creme with banana mouse was delicious. A gem in Portland. Great chef. Wonderful & knowledge waiter. A delightful restaurant.
360,"Fantastic food, ambience, people; vibe!!! We were headed to Hot Suppa and passed this amazing establishment. Free parking available in back. Followed by A quick chat with the hostess revealed immediate seating was available at the bar. Latte nice and strong even iced, frosty chai followed by mushroom scramble with big fluffy English muffins and awesome home made jam upon request. Crispy home fries or cheesy soft grits!!! Service is friendly, fun and extremely attentive!!! Food is first rate. WOW!! Super Yummy, awesome, amazing!!!!!"
361,Best. Breakfast. Ever. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with sausage patty and it was the most delicious sandwich I've ever eaten. The home fries were awesome. The atmosphere is super cute and cozy. I can't wait to try it again!
362,"We have come back to Local 188 a few times in recent months to celebrate friends birthdays, and have had such a great time! The staff, as always, are friendly and helpful. We congregate on the sofa's in the middle and feel like local celebrities. Recently, I learned that I can order a very good and very affordable Manhattan with a surprisingly good, well whiskey, which makes me especially happy.

I also returned to Local last week for dinner with a colleague. It was early on a Thursday evening, we sat at a table by the window and had a terrific experience. My colleague had the Roasted Cauliflower Risotto and really enjoyed it. I had the Bay Brined Chicken with Faro and it was one of the best chicken dishes I've had in a long time!"
363,Drove all the way here after calling to see if they were open and was told by staff they were. Supposedly they're  open until 1 am but apparently close shop at 10:45. Thanks a lot local 188 for your staff telling me that you were open but closed 8 minutes later upon arrival. Thanks!!!
364,Came here last night for our first night in town. Service was quick and super friendly. Andy was our server and helpful. I had the spicy margarita and Andy helped my boyfriend decide on his drink. We shared a couple of tapas which were all delicious. My favorite was the warm goat cheese. Great meal!
365,"I didn't enjoy the food here at all. We were looking for brunch and our first choice wasn't open yet so we kept walking and decided to give the Local 188 a try. Once we were seated, I kind of wanted to leave. In between a woman and toddler and a group of three men using really foul language. Not a fan. We decided to order and I went with the eggs and hash while my dining partner went with the herbal eggs (made with goat cheese). For drinks, he got some crazy grapefruit mash up (which is what gives it two stars as I stole it from him and loved it) and I got an overly bitter mimosa that didn't taste right. Not tasting quite right would be a theme of the breakfast. His eggs were okay but I didn't like anything that I received. It wasn't even real hash. It was a huge slab of brisket that had a weird taste to it. The home fries and egg over easy had a similar taste so I think a spice combo they were using just did not agree with me. I ended up eating my English muffin (grilled and buttered nicely) and also my friend's English muffin as he struggled to eat my breakfast too (didn't want to waste it, ha). I had to giggle during the meal though as I looked over and the toddler was actively spitting out food his mom was giving him so he must have had a similar reaction to the spice combo that I had. We'd definitely not return. They were packed though so looks like a popular spot."
366,"we're i only reviewing the food and the ambience of this place, it'd be a total 5. but the service was insanely bad. we watched the table next to us outside get their entire meal comped after a thorough apology from a manager, and figured something had just gone wrong. when we hadn't seen our waitress for more than half an hour after she dropped off our coffee and fruit, i went inside to investigate. she seemed surprised that i was still there, and said i must be ready for my check. i suggested we have our breakfast first. 50 minutes after we ordered it, the food came out. we asked if we could please have more coffee, got that, then had to ask again for silverware. the food was good, but they let the anticipation build a little too long, and never even acknowledged there was a problem."
367,"The food here is so good from the full on Tapas to the entr√©es. The complimentary bread they provide is so good. The service on the other hand is average and to me needs improvement due to its inconsistency.

I was here twice, the first time I did not get a friendly vibe from my server. She barely asked if I was familiar with the menu or if I needed assistance ordering and walked away; good thing what I ordered was excellent.

The second time I wanted just a drink. I arrived on a Thursday and The bartender was also the DJ. She spent almost ten minutes fussing with the music and didn't take my drink order till finally I got her attention. I had to lower my stars due to service.

She has not even asked if I wanted another drink. I thought this place was good...but I may only come back when the kitchen is open."
368,"Local 188 has a nice selection of options for dinner. My fianc√© and I split the seafood paella which was delicious and full of mussels, fish, clams and lobster. It was the most expensive thing on the menu at $39 but well worth the high price tag especially since we split the dish and both walked away full. Out for friends ordered the hanger steak ($17) which was much more of an appetizer though that was unclear on the menu and our server didn't mention the small portion size when they ordered it as their main entree. Luckily they also serve complimentary bread drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt - yum!

They have a nice long list of beer options with quite a few local brews. There is also a good sized wine list and interesting cocktails."
369,"We ended up going to Local 188 for brunch last Sunday after learning that the wait at Hot Suppa was going to be an hour long (and we were starving). A local we met at Eventide had highly recommended Local 188 for brunch, so we knew we couldn't go wrong. My boyfriend had the corned beef hash, which he said was pretty darn good. The hash had sizable pieces of tasty corned beef. I went with the breakfast paella, which was soooo delicious! The waitress did give me a heads up that the breakfast paella takes a little bit of extra time, but it's so worth it in my opinion. We waited about 20-25 minutes for our food. The paella was HUGE and probably should be shared by two. It was full of andouille sausage and bacon hiding in delicious rice. There was also some really tasty marinated chicken as well as calamari and mussels. I'd highly recommend it! I didn't get a chance to try one, but the local who recommended Local 188 to us said that they have killer bloody Mary's."
370,"Really good seafood paella and nice wine list. Spacious yet cozy space with open kitchen. 
Would've been 5 stars if the waiter wasn't such an unfriendly awkward sourpuss.  :("
371,"We ended up here as the other places we wanted to have dinner at had a hour wait. We had yet to check out this place so we we were excited to give it a try, but oh man, the experience was not great and the food was just okay. 

We were here for almost two hours and spent 25 minutes of it waiting for our last dish to come out after we had finished all our other dishes. We were only a party of three so it's not like we ordered a lot of food. 

I'm giving this place two stars as the mussels were delicious and our server did do her best to make-up for whatever issues they were having in the kitchen. However, our other dishes were pretty bland and cold. 

And, if you go, you should know that you have to ask for bread. They won't ask you if you want any and it's not on the menu."
372,"Last night we came here for dinner.  Alan made 7:00 reservations and we headed over in the rain.  It's down the block from Hot Suppa, where we had dinner a couple of nights ago.  Happily I noticed on Local 188's website that they have free parking in the back, so Alan was able to pull into the driveway and find a parking spot.  We walked down the driveway to the entrance, which is in front.  I didn't see a back entrance.  There were several potholes in the driveway, each of them neatly encircled w/ white paint, so we were alerted not to step in them.  The driveway is well lighted after dark, so the walk is a safe one.  There is outdoor seating, but not last night.

We walked into the restaurant, which is large and warehouse-like, w/ high ceilings and exposed ductwork.  There is nice art on the walls and an interesting piece of abstract sculpture on the ledge near the window table where we were seated.  Around the sculpture were potted plants.  We were given menus.  There was a drink menu on the table and a little triangle menu w/ Happy Hour drinks on one side and Monday night special half-off bottles of wine on the other.  I opted for a glass of Malbec.  Our server, Liz B, gave me a taste of it because I mentioned I'd had kind of a disappointing one the previous night.  It was good.  Alan had water because he had a beer at home he was going to drink.  We already knew we wanted to share a seafood paella and to order some tapas to hold us until the paella was ready.  We ordered deviled eggs after Alan determined there was no bacon in them to increase the sodium.  We also ordered the green salad w/ buttermilk dressing.  We were torn between the meatballs and the chicken pinchos (spelled phonetically on the menu).  Liz recommended the meatballs and I was pleased because I was envisioning La Marcha's albondigas, which I love.  They didn't have octopus on the menu or we probably would have ordered that.

Liz brought a plate of bread drizzled w/ olive oil, volunteering that normally she sprinkles the bread w/ salt and pepper, but didn't for us.  Very thoughtful.  After a short wait Liz brought the eggs, meatballs and salad.  We were all surprised.  She commented that the kitchen must have been bored to have prepared them all so quickly.  We had expected they would come out slowly, one by one.  We tried the eggs.  Alan found his too salty, so I had the remaining two, which were unremarkable.  The three meatballs were surrounded by a tomato based sauce.  They were firm in texture and just OK in taste.  Nothing like La Marcha's.  The salad was a generous portion and very tasty, w/ interesting lettuces, goat cheese and seasonal vegetables, including something faintly purple and thinly sliced that we forgot to ask about.  We liked the salad the best of the three dishes.  Since the tapas came out so quickly there was a longer wait for the paella.  When it arrived it was gorgeous, crowned w/ mussels and clams, w/ scallops, shrimps and calamari plus a luscious piece of unidentified white fish.  The rice had a nice crust in places.  It was well worth the wait.  It was more than enough for two.  We couldn't even finish it.  The restaurant filled up as we ate, w/ large parties and small.  It was a very good meal."
373,"3.5/5 

Came for dinner because they have some outdoor seating! (~5 tables for small parties)

Hostess and waiter we're both very friendly. We ordered the ricotta gnocchi (really good!) and meatballs ($8 for 3 meatballs) - came out mildly warm, wish it was hotter; probably won't order this again. 

Alcoholic drinks seem to be a big hit here. Ordered the basil lemonade with gin- sooo good!"
374,"After going a bunch more times, I've decided it deserved that extra star... 

A great place with ample seating on the Peninsula.  We go here often for drinks and since it's near our house, we eat here often as well.  They have a huge open space for intown and the menu is wide and varied from small plates to large.  Plenty of open seating and you can look at the kitchen as well if you want, something we enjoy.  

Some standouts are deviled eggs, the mussels (tried it with red this time, very good!), the goat cheese au gratin, and the mushroom risotto.  

Staff and bartender are attentive but not obtrusive.  And the food is really top notch.  Plus they take reservations and walk ins."
375,"We came here because of the wait at another place and boy am I glad it was. Serving brunch on a holiday when they don't normally and it was great. Had the ricotta fritters to start. Slightly over, but the inside soft and delish and the lemon curd was amazing. Had the Hash and it was spectacular. Real corned beef, not that canned garbage. Hollandaise was great. Buddies loved their paella and burrito. Highly recommend."
376,"3 stars because of the decor!! Such a cool/chill place. I wish there was a place like that in Jersey!! The whole place is filled with antique furniture, couches, a cool bar, and a live (you can see the cooks) kitchen area. 

Now, on to the food. I have to start off by telling you guys how hungry I was. I seriously was starving searching for a restaurant with the best reviews and found this one. First off, the good thing was that they start you off with a complimentary plate of bread with olive oil and salt which tasted delicious. As for the entree, I ordered the Flank steak and it was good... but incredibly small (maybe I just eat too much haha). My boyfriend had the rib entree and it was so small too, it was mostly bone and just a few pieces of meat. This would probably only apply to those who are searching for a decent sized meal. Seriously, I was so disappointed. I was still so hungry afterwards I had to search for a pizzeria. 

With that being said, Local 188 is still perfect for a nice place to hang out and enjoy a drink just don't come here hungry."
377,"Their service is always amazing, and their brunch is true perfection....but their pancake is LEGENDARY! You must try it....you have not lived until you have had a pancake from Local 188. 

This particular trip was for my mother's birthday and when they found out she had her drink served in a birthday mug and her pancake arrived with a candle!"
378,"Unfortunately, I have heard so many great reviews for this place, and have had an amazing brunch experience before, but the dinner was unpleasant. The menu had no explanation of what anything was, and when we asked we felt like a hassle, and ended up leaving very hungry still."
379,"I'm not the type to enjoy breakfast or mimosas.  I think it's because I never had a good mimosas...in decades of drinking.  So having discovered Local 188...I came to Portland with a friend and she ordered a mimosa and I ordered a Bloody Mary ( 2nd best bloody I've had).  I don't know what type of voodoo they put in the mimosas.  Something carmelly but not too sweet...just the right amount of goodness.  The breakfast was so good.  To a person who hates breakfast, for the very first time I learned to enjoy eggs.  I started eating eggs again after my experience here."
380,Lots of beers and nice ambience. Good tapas... try the deviled eggs and meatballs. Good service too.
381,"Local 188 is perfect!!! I love that they have parking, a lounge with couches, massive windows the span the entire restaurant, an impressive amount of plants, super clean bathrooms- you just can't find that type of vibe in the city anymore. The drinks with infused spirits are fantastic! Their servers are particularly knowledgeable about the food, and as a regular almost all of them know me by name. Jocelyn is a doll and her energy always has me leaving full and in a great mood. 


Thank you 188!"
382,"So,  my one breakfast in Portland was planned around Hot Supra, just down the road. They had been damaged in a storm and were opening late, so a local said this place was amazing too. We arrive before too many people have the same idea and are seated. It took 25 minutes to get a beverage. I was not in my happy place. As more and more people arrived and flowed into the streets, I thought, this is going to be bad...  The waitresses were moving quickly and politely, and I never saw them flustered. Then the food arrived. OMG. It was beyond, exactly what I ordered. The eggs were perfectly over easy. I got that extra sauce I requested AND the corned beef hash was life altering. Soft beef, gently pulled and then fried like the patty it should be. I felt like the chef had cooked just for me. Then I looked at my husband's Legs & eggs (same thing). My moms plate too. All perfect. In. Every. Way. It is an open kitchen, so I got up to just look at it in motion. No yelling, just everyone doing their job. These people were expecting Sunday brunch and Mother's Day showed up. Job well done. I'm now planning a trip home, via way of Local 188. Need breakfast. Yummy!"
383,"Patatas were mushy and tasteless, the tostada was a bit better, and the flan is not worth $8.  Not even caramelized on top."
384,"We stopped here for brunch around 9.30 and there was no wait - although the line was out the door half an hour later.

We had the herb and mushroom omelette, the corned beef hash, and the salmon and bagel platter. The food came quickly, although it took a while to get our check. The omelette was divine - the goat cheese was tasty but not overwhelming, and both the home fries and accompanying English muffin were great! My father thought his corned beef hash was fine but not out of this world; my mother loved her salmon bagels, although she mentioned that the salad wasn't very fresh.

Great place for brunch, make sure to get there early (you can also order coffee while you wait). Would highly recommend the omelettes!"
385,I had the Seafood Paella. Food was average to above average but it might have been because it took almost an hour to be delivered to our table. I was with a large party and we tried several of the appetizers which were quite tasty. The house cocktails were fantastic and wait staff was very friendly and attentive.
386,"Local 188 is a Spanish restaurant in Portland, Maine that serves up tapas style dishes. There are a number of great items that you'll be able to find here including a delicious Spanish paella with tons of seafood.

My Overall Rating - 3 1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - Local 188 is a very nice restaurant. It has a very welcoming feel, and you want it you will find a nice seating area in the middle. There are plenty of tables and booths to accommodate any size party. However, one of the best features is something that you do not find often in Maine: parking! There is a private lot that you can park in. It is also free to park. 1 Star.

Service - our server was quite nice; however, what I really like about them was that they were very knowledgeable about the menu. If you visit a restaurant that serves up dishes tapas style, it is all about being smart about what you order because the dishes are meant to be shared. So I really like it when the server is extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, and taking recommends that the allotments based on what you like or don't. 1 Star.

Food - but when it comes to tapas style dishes, there are always going to be some dishes that are said and some that are not. The goal is to try to catch on as many as possible. I did find quite a number dishes that I enjoyed including an excellent Spanish paella do that is loaded with clams, scallops, and even some lobster. They also had an excellent risotto that was creamy and full of garlic flavor. My favorite dish was the gnocchi. This beautiful pasta was a joy to eat as I love the pillow like texture. There were a few other items that we didn't particularly like including the Mediterranean meatballs. I would stick to the seafood items only. Also their carne asada was a bit bland and forgettable. In fact, we did order more tapas dishes but for the life of me I cannot remember what they all were, so they really did not make that big of an impression on me. 1 Star.

Will I Return? - Probably not. This has more to do with the number of excellent restaurants left to try in Portland vs. Local 188's quality.  It was a good but not fantastic/return worthy enough.  Then again, I won't say no if someone suggested it for dinner.   1/2 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
387,"Great brunch and a fun atmosphere. We got the huevos rancheros and the breakfast burger, both of which were very good. They have a bunch of different kinds of bloody mary's, too, which is always a plus! We both got the regular bloody, and it was delicious."
388,"I always want to try some place new for brunch but I always wind up here, my favorite place! Their mimosa's come to you in a pretty big, stemless wine glass which is a nice departure from the typical champagne flute. You MUST try their biscuit with honey butter! A warm flaky biscuit with a big heaping pile of honey butter that would make anyone want to lick the plate. I usually don't stray from their breakfast sandwich because it's so good. It comes with a side of home fries and is cooked to perfection. If you are going on a Sunday, be prepared to wait. They have really great lounge areas where you are welcome to eat or just hang out while waiting for your table. Super laid back but amazing food."
389,"Ordered the breakfast paella - my egg over easy was fully overcooked. I had waited for over an hour for the meal, so it was a bummer when the meal wasn't prepared correctly. I had heard good reviews but was not impressed with the food. It feels as if there is too many tables for the staff to keep up with. While seated at the bar I saw what appeared to be a kitchen staff member pre-toasting english muffin buns? I hope I am mistaken and they were just using them that quickly..."
390,"Health code violations everywhere!  We got seated at the area that looks in to the kitchen.  The kitchen is all open air so you get a great view of all the food prep and serve.  Not sure if this place has to follow any guidelines on health codes but there wasn't a single cook/food runner wearing food service gloves, instead handling all of the meats and breads with their bare hands.  The raw bacon beside one of the cooks was in an open uncovered container and probably had been that way all day.  Also, the one young food runner with red hair was constantly on his phone, dropping his phone in his pants pocket and then removing it to check his messages.  Then he would regularly run his hands through his hair.  After that, he would cook the english muffins in the toaster, of course with his bare hands.  I can't imagine this place could pass any sort of health inspection but maybe they don't require that in Maine.  This place is nasty."
391,"Sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and gave great recommendations. We had a few plates to share...the mushrooms, goat cheese, seared shrimp, and gnocchi. Everything was delicious. Fun atmosphere, free parking is a plus!"
392,"I don't even know where to begin with this review..... The amazing service? The best most amazballs English muffins? The most extensive beer and wine list I have ever seen? Or the coziest most comfiest relaxed chill come in and just hang out vibe place? 

Service- amazing. Our waitress Alexandra went above and beyond. Since we're not from this area we asked her for ideas. She came back to us with a list of her top places to go. Friendly. Helpful. Top notch service! 

Food- OMFG! 
I experienced my best breakfast EVER in this place! I know. That's a bold statement.  But it's true! I'm not a ""breakfast"" person. I'm a ""bruncher"" give me a great Bloody Mary or mimosa and a decent egg samwich and I am fine. Well ladies and gentlemen. I am ruined for life now after eating here. 
1st time there I ordered a Mimosa. Fresh and delish and not too heavy on the OJ. Just the way I like it. My meal was the field greens and mushroom scramble which consisted of goat cheese creamy goodness, the freshest mushrooms I have ever had, and spinach. On the side were home fries and the WORLDS BEST English muffin. Kid you not. The best. I need to have more. My meal was amazing. So farm fresh and so so good. 
My husband had the legs and eggs. Eggs over easy so he could use the fresh made biscuit to soak up the egg yolk and grits then a big ol chicken leg battered to perfection. 
2nd visit we went back for breakfast again! More English muffins. More fresh fall scrambled eggs this time. Brie cheese. Sweet potato. Butternut squash. And my husband and had the hash and eggs. Everything was amazing. Can't say anything other than that. 
A-Maze-Ing! 

This place is relaxed. Couches to sit and hang out on. Two bar top areas. Open kitchen. Lots of tables. Such a cool vibe. Like hanging out at home with friends. (Just better food) ;-) 

Check this place out and be prepared to need a nap after you eat."
393,"Had a pretty OK brunch here but the coffee wasn't wonderful and the food was alright. We liked that they were open when we woke up at 9, but the eggs were a little slimy, the grits were great, and the Chicken was amazing so legs and eggs makes it a good experience."
394,"My last breakfast in Maine was here. I truly feel it was the perfect place to bid Maine a farewell. As in most places in Portland, especially on a weekend, there is a wait. The place is very comfortable and open. Definitely hipster (ish,esque). They have an open kitchen which is something I always love. It gives you a genuine appreciation of some of the moving parts required to get the food on your plate. Ok! Down to brass taxes, the food! I had the steak and eggs. Simple enough, but executed expertly. True medium rare steak, eggs over easy, crispy home fries, and house made English muffin. My friend had the brunch paella. It is a BIG portion of sleep inducing deliciousness. I gave it a taste and it is extremely flavorful with a good spice kick from the chorizo. This was the best breakfast I had while in Maine. There are many good eats in this city. As you eat your way through Portland make sure to stop in to local 188..... And as always, ENJOY!!!"
395,"One of our Portland favorites, this is the one place we always try to get to when we're here. Great staff, an incredible menu, and inventive drinks, we always sit at the bar. The paella is the best I've ever had."
396,"Great breakfast spot! The food is flavorful and delicious. Fun interior and vibe - exposed ceiling, local art, couches, bar, lots of light. Would love to come back for cocktails or dinner."
397,"Ok, so the food was awesome.  We were there for breakfast and appeared we got there just before the massive breakfast crowd showed up.  We got breakfast burritos, smoked salmon bagel sandwich, salad and yogurt/gorilla.  The food was all good.  The service, however, could use a bit more attention.  I think the server just got busy and forgot the salad which had to be ordered later on the fly and no one got their coffees refilled."
398,"We only had one night in Portland, and although I initially wanted to have some kind of fancy dinner, neither I nor my gf were particularly eager to go to a stuffy restaurant in Portland. And, after a pretty heavy lunch, we decided to venture out for some late bites. Local 188 was a somewhat random choice, but fit the bill.

As soon as you walk in, a cozy feeling settles in. It's a big, open, beautiful space with lots of modern, local touches. There are regular tables, couches, bar seats, and fanciful oversize lounge chairs fit for giants. It's an artist's paradise.

The kitchen was closing around 10, so we quickly ordered some drinks and bites. I got the charcuterie (house cured ham, Montreal smoked brisket, guanciale, oxbow spam) and a flight of some fantastic beers (including ""Lunch"" by Maine Beer Co.), as well as a Bourbon hot toddy. Our waitress was friendly and rolled with the punches, even as she was preparing to wrap up kitchen service.

Highly recommended any time of day!"
399,"I ordered the seafood paella. It was delicious and very well proportioned which is the only positive thing about the menu because my other party members ordered other plates and was very dissatisfied with how small they were. In total, we ordered the acallops (which comes with two), 2 salads, and the ricotta gnocchi. Like really? I'm dropping $250 for food and drinks and you can't even fill my salad plate with lettuce? No. 

The drinks were very tasty and we'll made. Definitely try the Caribbean mule or mojito. We also ordered a bottle of reisling. Very fruity and not too sweet. You can never do wrong with thr one they have."
400,"Had a really nice experience at this place. This is a small sized diner with around six tables and counter seating. They try their best to get people in and out due to the long lines and wait times. However during the waits you can always walk around the street and into the stores. 
The food was excellent. My brother who is a Diner Connoisseur even enjoyed the food. He really liked their Corned beef hash. 

Overall had a pleasant experience and think the Diner is one of the more enjoyable places I went to."
401,Place is packed early morning on weekends.  Cash only.  Food is typical American.  Great size servings.  Food is excellent and the staff is very friendly.  Price is moderate
402,"Delicious food (grilled muffins!) in this cozy little place.  Great service, will be back when in town again."
403,"This is our favorite breakfast place in the entire world.  It is a big reason for us coming up to visit Portland.  Marcy's is the best!  

Mandy and the people that work there are exceptional and make their patrons feel like family.  There are always great specials, muffins, quiches, and the regular menu is incredible.  I live for the Hobo Hash Browns.  If you like hot sauce, the 'Bucket of Pain' will bring the heat.

We eat here every morning that we are in Portland.  We went Sat.- Mon. and each day was a treat.  We can't wait to return."
404,"Ah, Marcy's Diner. You are a classic. A simple, consistent, unassuming staple in the Portland breakfast scene. You're a grilled cheese on thick white bread; a go-to; a never-gets-old.

I love the gritty diner atmosphere. I love the massive serving sizes, with leftovers-a-plenty. 

There are three things you need to know before going to Marcy's: 
1. Bring cash.
2. Go with 1 other person (Marcy's is too small for groups, seating for 2 is easiest, and if you go by yourself there is no one to share a muffin with)
3. Always get a grilled muffin.

The last couple times I've eaten here I sat at the bar, right up next to the grill. Front row seating for watching the hashbrowns get crispy. I think it's my new favorite spot. The booths are tiny, I'd rather watch the cooks get their groove on. 

Most recently I ordered a special - breakfast tacos - and asked for no meat. Being in my prime spot behind the grill, the owner/chef asked me if I would like to substitute grilled mushrooms. Of course, I said yes, and they were a fabulous addition to the cheesy-egg tacos!

I don't go to Marcy's often, cause there's often a wait and it's not ideal for kids or groups, but on a weekday morning, I'll happily grab a spot at the bar and nom on a muffin!"
405,"- funny staff
- cute coffee mugs
- best muffins in town!
- great location
- cute atmosphere
- no parking, really
- lots of seats
- cash only, unfortunately :-("
406,"Amazing diner with lots of character. This is a small place - 6 or so tables and a counter. They make quick work of table turnover and are organized about getting everyone in. It's cash only and they are very good about making sure no one is surprised. They had music playing which was a nice addition to the morning breakfast stop. 

We absolutely loved visiting Marcy's. We sat at the counter near the grill and got to see how fantastic the team was in action. We opted for the grilled muffin of the day (mint chocolate chip), pancake of the day (toffee almond), a side of corned beef hash, an egg, and one of the breakfast combos with the hobo (cheese and veggie laden) hash. The food was piping hot and delicious. The pancake was enormous!

The food was priced right and we were stuffed when we left."
407,"LOVED everything about this place.  The downtown vibe, the comfortable booths, the cozy smallness inside, the friendly server, and the piping hot coffee on a cold day.  The hash browns were our favorite - crispy outside, creamy soft inside, and well seasoned.  Bring cash. But don't miss it."
408,"Quaint, happy place with the most lovely staff. Best grilled raspberry muffin on God's good Earth"
409,"New owner as of February 2019!! Such a welcome change! The new owner will actually open and not close at the drop of a hat...
Great food, great staff! 
Keep up the good work Mandy and team - wishing you all the best in your new venture!"
410,"I was VERY excited that we got a chance to check out Marcy's this Portland trip.  The last trip we took just happened to fall on their closed day and we were so disappointed.  I made sure that wasn't the case this time!

This is such a cozy little breakfast spot (that is cash only)!  They have a lot of locals that you can tell come in often, if not daily.  The food was so good!  We tried the cap'n crunch French toast and it was delicious.  The coffee was hot and great and the grilled muffin lived up to the hype!  You must try this.  It's huge...

The staff is friendly and will help you out and give suggestions.  Get there early!  I hear the line gets long.  This place doesn't seat a large amount of people.  I would definitely come back."
411,"What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
I'm gonna add to it anyway.

YES:
- the servers. Sassy, hilarious, quick, no-BS. Happy to explain menu items and accommodate any guest's needs.
- the food. YAS. This is literally the best hangover food on earth. It is deliciously greasy, and they provide a bunch of hot sauces for the table. The serving sizes are INSANE. Come with your appetite. Their French toast is among the best. And their pancakes. The pancakes are the size of a serving platter.
- the prices. SO. DAMN. REASONABLE. Like, you can order half the menu and it'll still be reasonable.
- the location/feel. It's small, you're lucky to get a table. You're lucky if you get a bar seat! Just feel lucky you even get to be in here. It's authentic and great.
- their homemade muffins. HOLY MOLY. They make special muffins, so be sure to grab one before they're totally sold out. And make sure to ask for them grilled- they cut the muffin in half and grill it in butter until it's crispy. IT IS AMAZING.
- coffee/tea: if you order one with your meal, they'll give you one to go after you finish eating! Last time I came here I ordered an iced tea, and on my way out the door they gave me a brand new, fresh iced tea. This is so stellar. Above and beyond. Nowhere else does this!

EH...:
- cash only. Luckily Mathew's, the dive bar next door, allows patrons to use their ATM. Wish they had one here though.
- the wait: can be super duper long. In the spring/summer, it's lovely, as they have a little bench outside. In the winter, it's pretty dreadful to wait. Really depends on how much you want some delicious Marcy's.

Get lunch or breakfast or brunch here. It is filling, delicious, and entertaining. Don't be offended when they bring your check over before you ask for it- this is a quick service place. It's casual, a great meet-up spot for locals, and makes you feel like you're getting an authentic diner experience.
Come here and order everything your heart desires. It's all worth it."
412,"This place is super friendly, delicious. Arrived early for breakfast with hubs, around 830/9am. We were seated right away at the bar. But it's a small place so I'd recommend coming early or else you might have to wait.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, and service is attentive and fast.  It's your typical greasy spoon diner but everything is really well done, satisfying and portions are huge. 

We started off with one of their muffins (grilled which meant toasted and warmed). Highly recommend. They are very tasty. Kind of like corn bread. The special they had was the Tres Lesches which was delish because it came with a three milks sauce to dunk.  The muffin was very top heavy; the top being crumbed. I didn't try this part too much but the body was very yum. 

I then had the meal that included: silver dollar pancakes (warning. These are fluffy huge size pancakes; I could only eat a slither), eggs of your choice (got a wet scramble), bacon (They only give you two strips of your meat choice - which was fine by me but just fyi), and hashbrowns, which are shredded - my fave. You can upgrade to ""hobo"" style which is with onion, jalapeno and cheese (I opted out of the cheese). 

My husband got an option that came with eggs (perfect done sunnys, he said), sausage (not the gross shrunken kind), and rye toast.

Highly recommend for an early breakfast to start off the day and taking a seafood break. Many people were eating the fluffy pancakes."
413,"So happy we found this diner for breakfast!  It's a small place with maybe 6 booths and a counter. They are only opened half the week and only take cash. The staff are super friendly especially the gal that took care of us. Don't come here if you don't get their homemade muffins....grilled. Yup, grilled. We split the raspberry muffin and it was the bomb!!  I had the Greek omelette for breakfast stuffed with spinach, olives and feta. My husband had corned beef hash. Both were very good.  This place is an old school diner with good food and good people. Great place for breakfast...and that muffin!!"
414,"Stopped by here with my boyfriend while we were in Portland to grab some breakfast. We came in around 8:30 on Sunday. There was thankfully a seat open so we didn't have to wait at all. Once we sat down our waitress came over to introduce herself. 

We took a look over the menu and decided to get blueberry pancakes and Cap'n Crunch coated French toast. The waitress warned us that the pancakes were big and she wasn't lying lol. The food came out relatively fast and they played good music throughout our time there. 

The blueberry pancakes were delicious and had plenty of blueberries in them. The Cap'n Crunch French toast was amazing. If you have a sweet tooth I suggest you try it. 

We were here for about 30 minutes. The total was about $20 for two pancakes, two French toast, coffee and a side of bacon. Not bad! I would definitely come back here when I'm in town. 

*Tip* this place only accepts cash!"
415,"Oh my goodness. Excellent place for breakfast. We got to Marcy's early, since we had heard it gets crowded. We were seated right away, told the specials, and then left to make our decisions. I got one pancake with bacon (IN THE PANCAKE!) and a side of hash browns. THE PANCAKE WAS THE SIZE OF THE *PAPER* PLATE. I was honestly shocked, amazed, and delighted at the portion. I couldn't finish the whole thing, but who doesn't love a toasted leftover pancake? The hash browns were perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My dining companion ordered french toast, a side of bacon (6 PIECES), and hash browns. He was equally pleased with his meal. 

A couple things to keep in mind: service was kind of slow, but I think this is due to the small space, so I'm guessing tiny kitchen? Marcy's is also cash only! 
Whenever I return to Portland, I will definitely make a stop at Marcy's."
416,Great service and excellent food. Takes a little time to prepare so for come in a rush.
417,"Don't miss out on this place! Hole in the wall diner that had the best shredded potato hash browns I've ever had. There was a short wait but the staff was fantastic, they'll get you coffee while you wait and once you sit down they don't skip a beat! Food was PHENOMENAL. I'll be back every time we make it to Portland!"
418,"Stopped by on a Sunday at noontime and only had to wait about 5 minutes to get two stools at the bar. Saw that it was cash only and once we placed our orders, had to walk to the ATM across from Nosh to get some cash. Not that big of a deal, but wish they accepted credit because that was a hassle. (It was worth it!)

We were told before we sat down that they were short staffed and only serving the front page of the menu, but the guy said ""Don't worry, it's all the good stuff"", and he was right. Ordered two banana walnut pancakes, hash browns, eggs, and sausage. Pancakes- delicious. So generous with the walnuts and banana. Hash browns and sausage were excellent. I don't like eggs so I passed them off to my partner. I can't even remember what he ordered because I was too busy stuffing my face. 

Service was great, the coffee was never ending and I probably had 3 cups. Took a little while to get our food but we didn't mind, there was only one person cooking and we weren't in a rush. 

Can't wait to come back!!"
419,"Tried out most of the diners in the PWM area. They're all decent, but this one edges them all out. 

Darla cooks up some great breakfast. The specials are always different from weekend to weekend and not on the normal menu. The muffins are to die for... And also always rotating in flavors. 

May encounter a wait... But with a cup of joe, breakfast special, & a muffin... It's worth it!"
420,"Anyone with dietary issues beware -- they are NOT accommodating at all. Went here with a friend who has a dairy allergy. She really wanted diner food, so she was willing to risk a little residual butter on the grill. But the waiter would not make her omelette without butter. After waiting hungrily for a table, we left without eating. 

Pros:
 - waiters were pretty nice
 - the space has a greasy spoon feel without looking run-down

Cons:
 - zero substitutions even for allergies
 - no A/C means this place is a sauna even on a cool day in the summer
 - potentially long wait"
421,"Awesome people, great food, very family and budget friendly place!  A PortlandTopTen. Try the muffins grilled in butter. Or anything here is plentiful and the best!  Marcy'sDinerTantrumScale 5/5-no screaming kids. Street parking available."
422,"Great local place, muffins are the best
Coffee is great too 
Ordered eggs sausage & hash browns w side of dollar pancakes.
Pancakes were the size of the plate, so good
Would miss out if you didn't try it out"
423,"Yelp strikes again!  Nice little diner that has no frills and is exactly as it is. Even though we were told 25mins to wait, it certainly didn't take that long. Ordered the spinach and feta quiche, D-licious!!!  We also had the Hobo Hasbrowns and that too was extremely good!!

I would highly recommend anyone to come here, but be ready to wait for a little bit as it is small and very popular and there is no disappointing...

The weather played a little havoc as Portland in heat is not good as most places don't have ac....and it was toasty for sure. We will come back fo sho!!"
424,"Was in town for the first time and wanted to try this place out based on the other reviews, and it did not disappoint! 

Tried the special of the day, breakfast tacos which I think were the best breakfast tacos we have ever had, nice crispy corn tortillas, and then we also split their grilled blueberry muffin and a banana pancake! All were delicious! 

Fresh squeezed lemonade and iced coffee were on point and yummy, as well as great service! 

Stop here if you are in town!"
425,"Food was ok. They apparently don't know the difference between hash browns and home fries.  I had the special apple cider pan cakes with my hash browns (supposed to be home fries).  Apple cider pancakes were good.  Staff was friendly enough...   That's the end of the positive. 

SUPER loud.  Would be a great volume for a bar, but not a breakfast place. The booth was SUPER cramped... I am not a large person, and I could barely move my arm to eat my food.  They ARE NOT KID FRIENDLY! We had our 1 yo with us.  They have booster seats that are impossible to get the child into and barely fit in the tiny booth seats.  The service was RUSHED!!! By the time we got our child in the awful booster seat and opened the menu, the waitress had been around twice and my wife had to rush her selection.

The 2 stars is a gift..."
426,"I got yelled at while at Marcy's. 

There is definitely a locals feel to this place, which is a good and a bad thing. The good: they know many customers by name and what they will order.  The bad: if you're not a local you catch yourself looking around trying not to miss anything that's happening. 

We only come here on snow days to ensure that there won't be a wait. It has paid off for us during the last 4 visits. But rumor has it that the wait could get pretty lengthy especially on the weekends. 

The service deserves 5 stars. The staff will greet you once they see your hand on the handle to open the door. You will be served, refilled, and checked on by any and all of the people behind the counter. 

They always have specials written on the board, we always give those a try.  Depending on how busy they are or the time of day, they will run out of certain items. The muffins they serve are homemade. You have the choice to get it grilled with butter or plain. Today we had cinnamon chip, we wouldn't get it again. We got it grilled (strongly suggest) but it was still a bit dry. We should have stuck to our normal blueberry muffin. The omelette special for today was pesto chicken. It was tasty, but doesn't compare to the garlic chicken omelette special that they have from time to time. Our favorite part of the meal is definitely the hash browns, order them well done, trust me. 

**Marcy's is cash only**"
427,"Love it here!  I moved to Portland in 2007 and Marcy's was one of the first restaurants I visited and I keep going back.  It has a cool vibe, great wait staff, and healthy portions.  I usually go with the Hobo Hash Browns since it has all of my favorite breakfast foods piled on top of each other, but the daily fresh muffins are also delicious.  Thank you, Darla!"
428,"Highly recommend 
Man I really enjoy eating here when I'm up in Portland. It's a bummer this place is so small, so sometimes you have to hunker down and wait. 
I really enjoy the grilled muffins. I never seem to get there before raspberry sells out though - so I've only ever tried the blueberry. It's real good. 
I've had both their savory and sweet breakfasts. They cook eggs perfectly IMO. No where ever seems to get the cook right on my eggs - but I made my order - specified that it's a little different from the norm - and BAM perfect eggs. 
I tried the loaded hashbrowns, and while they were good, I think in the future I'll just get the regular hash browns. 
The pancakes are GIANT. The ""silver dollar"" pancakes take up an entire side plate. Be prepared. 
Only main bummer is the last time I was there I was overcharged (charged for two muffins when I only ordered and got one) but didn't notice until later. Will that stop me from returning? No way. I'm assuming it was an accident and probably not normal, I just recommend you give the check a close once over."
429,"I wish Marcy's was located in our home town!  We absolutely loved it here!!  

Small, modern type diner located in beautiful Portland Maine.  

A very fun upbeat place to be with a variety of music blasting in the background. The day we were here it was called ""Metal Monday"".  Each day there is a different theme.   

The staff is friendly and very energetic.  My husband and I recall the waitress we had as being ""vibrant, super smiley, full of life and wearing many beautiful colorful tattoos"".  

The breakfast was top notch!  Probably the best breakfast we have ever had.  The muffins were out of this world and the specials that they offer were over the top!  

Cannot wait to get to Marcy's again!!!!"
430,"Stayed overnight in Portland and found this gem purely by luck.

Not only was the food amazing but the service was exceptional, I'd go back for the food alone but with the service this place will be my go to for breakfast when ever I'm in town!"
431,"If you're looking for a nice little sit-down menu diner I highly recommend Marcy's, waiter asked if we would like a toasted blueberry muffin we said yes it was the greatest toasted blueberry muffin I ever ate.  Plenty of omelettes to choose from as well as side dishes for breakfast. My family had a great time I wish we would have went to Marcy's other days we were there too."
432,"Def try a muffin. Had a raspberry, since blueberry sold out by 9am.  Menu is straight forward. Hash was INCREDIBLE. The fruit was fresh. I had the hippy French toast and that was great. Coffee was a solid cup of joe."
433,"Fantastic!  Copious amounts of delicious breakfast delights.  Beyond the fabulous food, the service was awesome. I don't comment on yelp very often, but this tiny diner is spectacular!  We were lucky enough to not have to wait, but it would have been worth a wait. 

My wife had the Cap'n Crunch French toast and it was ""the best thing she had ever had.""  Her coffee cup was never empty and she received a to-go cup without asking! 

I had the E - french toast, eggs, bacon and hash browns. I asked for crispy hash browns (as I always do and never actually get) and this time I got what I ordered. 

Bottom line, we will be back here again!"
434,"Small downtown diner with all your favorite diner classics, good service, and since its Maine, a killer blueberry muffin.  While not in a diner car, the ambiance is still pretty old school and there are lots of great tchotchkes to admire while you wait.  The food is solid, don't expect much culinary innovation, but they do good breakfast at pretty reasonable prices.  The coffee, like most diners, isn't great.  I know that's usually expected, but Portland is a great coffee city and I was hoping that carried over to diners."
435,"Read in a previous comment the fruit bowl was fantastic. It's $7 for mushy grapes, old pineapple and pears. Not going back."
436,"If you are looking for a no frills breakfast spot this is it. Located in the art district. We went on a Sunday morning at 11am and the wait was 1hr. The food was okay nothing special. I had french toast, eggs and home fries. The portions are huge. Compared to the other restaurants we visited during this trip this one was just Eh. cash only which sucks because i had to get cash from the BofA on a sketchy looking block."
437,"Hard to get in as small and popular, worth the wait , great food , music and vibe 
In winter time , around 6 am like something from a Harry Potter movie - dark outside , easy lighting inside , fabulous."
438,"Sunday brunch, waited about 30 minutes. Portion size was okay. I ordered the corn beef hash, two over easy egg and hash. It's a small place, nothing extraordinary. Decent price - 9ish dollars."
439,"Hold me closer, tiny diner. 

Tiny diner full of personality, with great service.  

But that food tho, all cooked in front of the bar so you can watch every hair.

Everything is buttery. Even Paula Deen would be like, ""too much butter"" as she finished her second piece of yummy Chocolate Donut French Toast, thick, crispy but greasy hash browns, and crazy good grilled banana walnut muffins. 

Get thick or die tryin'."
440,"If you've not had a grilled muffin from Marcy's, you've not lived. Wasn't even aware such a thing would be life-changing (or even possible - who came up with this idea?!), but now I'm spoiled for regular muffins forever.

There's a bit of a wait (I was here on a Sunday) but the servers make it worth it! They're super nice and helpful, and definitely spread a great vibe throughout the diner.

I also ordered the French toast, over-easy eggs, ham steak, and hashbrowns (which were easily my favourite bit of my breakfast; my gods, the potatoes were good!), and only spent $18 between the two of us (husband got eggs, toast, hashbrowns).

Loved every minute of my time here!

P.S. - ""Be careful of gravity!"""
441,"Cash Only. Had breakfast here Monday, Nov 6, 2017. 

If they weren't so snippy toward out-of-town-ers they'd get more stars.  If they recognize you it's like Norm just walked into Cheers.  If they don't then it's like you're from Mars The guffawing with the local yokles was a bit over the top at times.  Ok, you don't like tourists. Message received.

""You can't bring any outside food or drink on here!""
""It's just skim milk for my coffee.""
""It's our policy.""
""Well, do you have skim milk?""
""No.""
""Then who is really being harmed?""

Food was good though."
442,"Simply awesome food (we've had different things and all have been so good) in a friendly fun environment, wait staff is simply amazing and your meal becomes a fun experience with the music around.  and do yourself a favor and ask for a grilled muffin, it's simply worth your calories"
443,"Went to Marcy's due to good reviews on Yelp. The positives are that all of the staff work hard to make sure you are taken care of. The coffee is hot and tasty, plus they have some great music going on in the background. As others stated, it is small only a few booths and then the stools at the counter. I went on a Thursday morning just before 9:00 and was seated at the counter. I was promptly poured a cup of coffee and told the specials. I ordered corned beef hash with over medium eggs and Hobo style hash browns. The portions were huge and eggs done perfectly. The not so good. Hash browns are dehydrated and not fresh, plus the corned beef hash appears to come from a can. As others mentioned it can be hot in the place due to lack of ventilation. Cash only but I was prepared by reading the other reviews."
444,"Incredibly rude! We waited 40 minutes and when seated, the music was blaring so loud that we could not hear the waitress or each other so we thanked the waitress and told her that we would just order food to take out and she could seat someone else in our seats When we stood up I tried to finish my water, (we had driven 3 hrs to get there) and the waitress grabbed the waters out of our hands and another one took the menus - right out of our hands that we were we were trying to read so we would know what to order to carry out.! Then the guy who would have taken our take-out order said it would take 40 minutes for that! So, we left never to return! Good luck if you go!"
445,"Have always wanted to try this place and after many stays in Portland, timing was right. Has excellent reputation for service and breakfast food. Usually the line is too long to wait because of size, but very happy I was able to get in on this visit. Super friendly staff and excellent service and food. It is small and was very warm in mid July with only fans for cooling. I did find music was way too loud for size. Hearing Shattered by Rolling Stones blaring for breakfast was a bit much. Overall, great place to try and definitely as unique atmosp"
446,"Driving back home on Sunday, stopped in Portland looking for breakfast. Arrived to find a line but what did we expect from a place with only 5 booths & ten counter seats. It was well worth the 30 minute wait.  We scored counter seats enjoying the conversation with the awesome staff and watching in awe the speed and agility of the cooks!
My omelette was huge and cooked to perfection....and I'm extremely picky about omelettes!  My wife had the Hobo hash browns with eggs which we all shared too! Our son had the steak & eggs also delicious! 
Coffee is a local brew too!  Just a heads up cash only, but don't let that or the line deter you. Definitely worth making the trip back to Portland!"
447,"Overall, the food was alright. Good for the price. Would have rated it 4 stars, but serviced left a lot to be desired, especially when we came for morning brunch.  Waited for 45+ min when we were initially told 25. Called our names but then gave our seats to another pair of hangry customers. Then waited another 10 minutes before getting a booth. If you come, prepare to wait or get there on a weekday."
448,"Great early Saturday morning breakfast! Extremely accommodating to our little one also, brought Cheerios and milk for him to snack on, then gave us coffee to go. Food was excellent, had the quiche and the eggs Benedict. Great portion sizes, and of course the grilled muffin was superb!"
449,Great staff and food. One of the best places I've been to in Portland. Ate the shaved chicken and oh my god - it was great. 10/10 would recommend.
450,This place was perfect for coffee and a grilled muffin on a rainy morning! Wonderful atmosphere and some really great music to relax by at the counter.
451,"Call first, because their hours change seasonally (and both Yelp and their website are incorrect). Wasted two mornings over last two months learning this the hard way."
452,"I've been wanting to visit this diner ever since the notorious controversy happened a couple years back (Darla is my hero) and experience the place for myself. Since I was in South Portland at a convention and visiting family, my mom and I decided that it was high time we tried Marcy's Diner. We showed up this past Sunday morning around 8:30 am and were greeted when we walked in by a cool yet polite guy and groovy music like Stevie Wonder and other upbeat tunes of yore. The cool dude promptly seated us at the counter and the dedicated, energetic waitstaff got our beverage order in moments. For food, my mom got the Crustless Quiche (Ham, Broccoli, and Cheese, I believe) and a colorful side salad, since she's trying to be as ketogenic as possible. I ordered D from the ""Favorites"" menu which included eggs, NY Strip Steak, toast (I opted for an English muffin), and hash browns. Oh my goodness...it was all so good. The steak (ordered Medium Rare) was just the right amount of pink and so juicy! The hash browns were a little like mashed potatoes but they were seasoned just right and the sunny-side up eggs were just runny enough that I could soak them up with my English muffin and hash browns. It was so substantial and stuck to my ribs so well that I barely wanted lunch or dinner later on! 
The only thing I will say as a word of caution is that it's probably best to go solo or just with one other person, since groups of 3 or more had a little bit more of a wait, but between the wait staff that could put the Energizer bunny to shame and the nice greeter/cashier guy, everything was running smoothly like a well-oiled machine.
What I liked the most definitely was how much the staff seemed to support one another and had an enviable amount of synergy. The dishwasher seemed like a new hire and was a little nervous, but the cool guy and the other waitstaff had his back and were giving him tips and encouragement every step of the way. I wish I had that much moral support at any job I've had! The waitress we had most of the time was so funny and had us laughing even at that early hour and took the time to get us a Marcy's Diner shirt (we usually don't get souvenirs but the bacon and eggs in skull and crossbones formation was just a hoot), never once making us feel like a bother. 
Darla was a delight even though I didn't get to say anything to her since she was busy cranking out breakfast. She was just cooking away merrily, grooving to music in her pom pom hat and Hawaiian shirt, and looked like she was having the time of her life.
I would go again in a heartbeat and I feel that a trip to the Portland area isn't complete without a trip to Marcy's Diner!"
453,"Traveling up from Pittsburgh and of all the places we have been so far, this is definitely my favorite for food. We didn't know that they closed at noon today but the staff was so nice and accommodating and was not mad at all that we were there a little after closing. The chef was also hilarious. Great food, great service, 12/10 recommend!!"
454,"I have found my new favorite place to eat in Portland and they don't even have seafood! This place was simple phenomenal. The staff was so nice and helped each other so well, and the food was the absolute best I have tasted so far on this trip. 100/10 would recommend and we will be back when we come back to Portland"
455,"Warning! Cash only!

Excellent service, and great price. 

Cool little place, I would definitely recommend if you're lookin for breakfast or brunch in Portland, me.

Upgrade your hashbrowns. Totally worth it."
456,"CASH ONLY! (or you will get scolded, so you know it's good!)

I was very impressed by this place.  I had high expectations, assuming this place would piggy back off the Screaming Kid Summer 2015 national publicity (yes, it was big talk even in Kentucky this summer) to skimp on food and service as a result.  But I was wrong; this place was fantastic in all ways possible.

First the atmosphere: it's your classic verbal-abuse diner.  It reminds me of going to Grandma's after a Democratic victory in the Elections: good cookin' but Grandma is pissed.  But seriously, the service is great.  They all have the typical frank but semi-friendly attitude with an accent (aka The Maine Special).  Parking isn't bad at 7:30AM; but good luck finding street parking later (I assume). I've seen this place packed out the Wahzoo (which probably explains why Marcy's successor is pissed 24/7 lol jk), so go early to beat the giant crowds that will eventually engulf this place later in the day!

The food was AMAZING!  I had the Corned Beef Hash Benny which was served on super-buttery Texas Toast and with a side of fluffy and buttery hash browns.  I was in Paula Dean Heaven (minus the scandals). And the prices were grand!  $23.74 for a large breakfast for 2 + 1 coffee.  And they sell their hot sauces!  $5 a bottle, and you get to see them go into the secret underground tunnel of hot sauces (this actually exists!).  I highly recommend the green Gringo Bandito sauce.

Bottom line:  Go here, get yelled at, eat lots of food, try some new hot sauce, and buy some sauces to go (because its still cheaper than going to 90% of other places in Portland).  Nicest staff in Portland, besides the verbal abuse :)"
457,"Always good. Had first date with my girlfriend here and now we're always coming back. Good coffee. Grilled muffins always crispy and buttery and muffin-y. My girlfriend loves the hobo hash browns, and my favorite is the hippy French toast. Friendly staff. The loud rock n roll might be off putting at first, but you get used to it, and it benefits the upbeat atmosphere overall. If you have to wait for a spot to clear, there are plenty of nearby shops to check out.
Update: last time the waitress misheard my girlfriend's order! So they charged us for the mistaken order (which was cheaper), brought us all we needed, with a free yummy muffin, and of course coffee to go! Good food AND service."
458,"The atmosphere of the diner is similar to a cozy hole in the wall style place. Music playing in the background is a mix of the best hits of the 80s and some 90s, bringing back memories of my younger days. 

The menu offers almost endless combinations of breakfast, brunch, and lunch options, almost to hard to choose from. I utilized the specials board to help me pick my meal for the day which was a rendition of a spicy chicken cheesesteak omelet #delicious. The portions are enough to keep this fat boy full all day. 

This is the second time I visited Portland and also the second time I have had breakfast at Marcy's Diner without disappointment. I would whole heartedly recommend this place to anyone in search of an amazing local experience. 

The only suggestion I may offer while eating there, is if you order the grilled muffins, ask them to cut it in quarters not halves and grill them. This being that in halves, the muffin is not warmed all the way through to the back side and who doesn't want more of that buttery crispy grilled crust of goodness."
459,"This place was aaaaamaze. I am always down to go to a cash only place, because I feel like the food has to be REALLY GOOD if you're going to have the chutzpah to turn away cards and know that people are still going to want to pay. And.... they were right. I'd pay in cash for the rest of my life if it meant that I could eat here every day. We had grilled muffins to start -- one raspberry and one blueberry. So so good. They don't need butter, but I liked them even more with it. I especially liked the raspberry muffin. For my meal I had the E1 (2 slices French toast, 2 eggs, bacon and home fries) with a coffee. I got the captain crunch French toast because I was intrigued. It was so worth it. I somehow ate the entire breakfast and was full all day after. Still. Drooling."
460,We went at 1030 on a Thursday and they were closed with no explanation. We made a special trip downtown for it. Very disappointing.
461,"Would have loved to have eaten here but they were so rude with putting me on hold for 10 min and then hanging up without taking the call. Day before they took a phone order and had food ready in 15 minutes. It was very good.

Wanted to do the sAme thing but was told "" we don't take phone orders"". I said you did yesterday, she then put me on hold never to pick up again. 

They were rude and short on both days."
462,"Way good. We were staying nearby and found this joint on Yelp. It was 8:30 on a Saturday and we lucked out and got a table quickly. A line formed outside as we ate. It's a tiny spot so plan for a snug experience. I hade the Nudge which was 2 eggs, Taylor ham and cheese on a bulky roll. It was perfect and you don't see Taylor ham much outside of Jersey so that was a treat.  The sandwich came with a heaping pile of shredded hash browns, perfect prepping my belly for our upcoming tour on The Maine Brew bus. My wife ordered a western omelet and gushed over how full of stuff it was and how pillowy the eggs were. The ham inside was also delish. 

The staff was super friendly. I know they've got a bad rap for hollering at a toddler but make no mistake, the staff oozed genuinely happy vibes."
463,"Small quirky diner with amazing food! Grilled muffins were amazing and so was the homemade lemonade. Pancakes are huge and fluffy! Place is small so usually a wait but well worth it. Would definitely recommend, look forward to coming back!"
464,"Went on a Sunday morning and was able to get a seat at the counter right away. This diner is on the smaller side, maybe 5 tables and about 10 seats at the counter. Menu is diverse and they had some interesting specials listed. I ordered a raspberry muffin grilled and a slice of spinach and feta quiche with hash-browns. This was way too much food. The muffin was huge and was more than enough to fill me up for breakfast - large portions here. Grilled muffin was great (warm from the grill, soft and moist on the inside with a sugary crunch crumble on top)! The quiche and hash-browns on the other hand were blah and lacking flavor, and I wasn't very impressed and didn't eat more than a couple bites of each of those.
Additionally, I was rather uncomfortable while trying to enjoy my breakfast as it was so hot in the restaurant - much better air ventilation is needed.

Muffin was really tasty and customer service was pretty great and for those two reasons, giving 3 stars, otherwise would have given 2."
465,"Brunch in Portland is great, but constant weekends standing in line for lobster & eggs benedict w/ bloody marys are going to cost you a pretty penny. Break that pattern and come to Marcy's instead! 

It's cute but tattooed, homey but not your grandma's, it's that perfect spot for you to get in, get delicious food, and get out--only to come back again tomorrow for more.

Among two people, I/we split a grilled blueberry muffin($3), peach cobbler pancakes (2 giant ones for $7), & the veggie hash special with eggs/toast ($9.50; $7 w/o eggs/toast). By early lunchtime on a weekday, the muffins were almost all out and I can see why! They're split down the middle and grilled with extra butter and they are DELICIOUS. It's actually quite filling and I wasn't able to finish my pancakes. 

The veggie hash was delicious, the pancakes were tasty but a little too much for me (the granola was a nice touch though!). All in all, I had a nice, hearty meal and a seat at the bar meant that I got to enjoy watching dozens of other hot meals get dished out during my short time there. 

While the food was great, the service stood out even more. From the friendly welcome at the door, to the personal greeting from the chef, every interaction felt genuine and kind. As the fellow at the door said, ""We'll see you tomorrow."""
466,"Come Hungry! 

My first time in Portland and I'm in love  with Marcy's Place... It's a small corner ""dive"" restaurant with some booths and counter bar stools. Put your name in at the register, grab a cup of coffee for the outdoor wait and start drooling over the menu selections! 

We were told the wait time would be 30-45 min but, it was more like 20. ( there were 2 of us ). We sat at the counter and watched the grilling magic in progress. Everything they prepared looked amazing in Hearty proportions! Entree sizes were definitely big enough to split. Daily specials are listed on a chalk board.

I had the French toast, eggs, hash browns and sausage breakfast. I left way too much food on my plate.... So stuffed!

Music was great! Very loud but along with the coffee it sure did wake me up! All of the staff were sweet as can be which is a shock if you could see how hard they work. I made sure to tip well cause they deserved it! 

Bring Cash. No Credit."
467,"Marcys diner is tucked in a corner one block over from where Otto's Pizza is on free street. Breakfast is always good. This is your standard diner that has maintained its old school decor. The staff was super nice. I was in Portland and craving diner food. I wanted just plain old simple diner food and Marcys diner was the answer. Breakfast food isn't the priciest so in terms of cost this place isn't too bad- the servings are huge! But they only take cash. They also have iced coffees to go. The restaurant is a bit stuffy. But now that the weather is getting cooler it probably won't be as bad. 

If you're in the mood for diner food with nice staff go to Marcys! But remember bring cash."
468,"My fianc√©e and I came to Marcy's Diner THREE times for breakfast. After our first time eating here, we agreed that this was going to be our breakfast spot while we were in town. Okay so let me get started: 

The place is cozy and awesome! The decor is cool and they play music from the 70's, 80's and 90's, so you'll most likely be jamming while waiting and/or eating (the radio station is 100.9). The wait time really wasn't crazy. Our first time, the super cool host gave us about a 20 minute wait and it felt like we got seated a lot faster. The second day, he gave us a 25 minute wait and it was just about right. Third day, Sunday, we got there around 8:15 AM and there was no wait. The waitresses are very attentive, polite, high energy and very cool to chat with. This place is hoppin'! One of my favorite things about Marcy's diner is that they have these bowls filled with Cabot butter and Hood half and half on each table. I love extra butter and love my coffee VERY light, so it was very convenient.

Darla (owner) is a firecracker and you can tell that she is passionate about her food and her business. She is in there cooking, greeting and keeps open communication with the staff. She even took a picture with us!

The food: there was nothing average about the food. AT ALL. It was off-the-hook! The first day we ordered a grilled raspberry muffin to share. It was toasty and soft in all the right places. It wasn't too sweet or bland. For our meals the first day, we had scrambled eggs with hash browns. The eggs were fluffy and perfect. The hash browns had a crispy top and very soft inside. Again, perfect. The Texas toast that comes on the side is delicious.

The second day, we ordered our own grilled muffins. This time I got blueberry and my fianc√©e got raspberry again. For our meals, he got the daily special which was the angel cake French toast topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and I got an Italian omelette with onions and Texas toast. We were more than satisfied with our meals. Everything tasted fresh and nothing was over or under cooked.

I tried the Spanish omelette on Sunday and in pictures it doesn't look too appealing, but it was delicious. We ordered 4 muffins for the road, 2 blueberry and 2 raspberry. Also, the iced coffee is damn good!

Overall the service was consistently awesome, as was the food. We are DEFINITELY coming back to Marcy's Diner."
469,"We were up SUPER early one morning and this was one of the few restaurants that were opened that early. This place really reminded me of a diner shop with the staff knowing who their regulars are. I read somewhere that they yell at people so we were on our best behaviors which we didn't get yelled at in the end. 

The portions here are enormous and definitely worth it. We ordered one of their breakfast platters (e.g. eggs, ham) and that filled us for a while. I also enjoyed the muffins a lot! I believe that is what they're known for and you won't be disappointed. 

Don't forget to bring cash since it's cash only. It's a small place so you might have to wait in line if you're going during prime time."
470,"If breakfast is the most important meal of the day, do yourself a favor and DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!! It is everything a diner should be! Great coffee and conversation. The staff is outstanding. The atmosphere is just fantastic. 

Now, the food....holy cow! Our hotel wanted to charge $10/person for breakfast, so we opted here instead. Everything we ordered was under $10. We started with the ""famous"" grilled muffin. Who knew this was a thing! I'm glad we didn't skip past this. What an awesome treat. I had the pot-roast hash and hash browns hobo style! Just do yourself a favor and go for it. It's a plate full of food, and each bite is better than the last. My wife had the BLT on a bagel and my daughter had the pancakes. There were NO leftovers. My wife remarked several times about how good the coffee was too!"
471,"Everything was good and large servings. We got the grilled muffins and a burrito that we split! Not a ton of room but we ended up being seated at the bar which was a pretty cool place. There was a wait and I presume this place always does have one.

Definitely a Meal you will want to nap after and don't come if your on a diet Bc you will eat everything !"
472,"Great experience. Friendly, helpful staff. Solid food. Honey bun French toast was excellent, prices were reasonable (lower than other options in the area). Local feel, even as a visitor just passing through. Felt a bit like a small town out west or down south. Went alone, sat at the bar, and loved it! A highlight of my brief stay in Portland."
473,"Continuing on my recent breakfast fixation i decided to try Marcy's today. I was kinda hoping for an eggs benedict. But i found a breakfast club made on three slices of bagel. Really cool!! Really delish hash browns. And the bacon i could go on for days about. The sandwhich was perfect and huge. With what seemed like 3 orders of hash browns all for 8$... After yesterday that was a big plus. 

The people working there are wonderfully personable, friendly, and colorful. They even literally crawl out of the floor from time to time (u have to be there kinda thing).. 

But CASH only.. ;-)"
474,"I've only been here once but I REALLY enjoyed it. Its a nice casual place to have breakfast when you just want to enjoy home-cooked food and the company you're with. 

I had a grilled lemon muffin and a fresh fruit bowl - the fresh fruit bowl had 7 different fruits in it, and I feel like thats worth mentioning because it SUCKS to get a fruit bowl that only has cantaloupe and honey dew in it. At Marcy's they do it right. My dining partner had a huge french toast breakfast with all the sides and LOVED it. Last thing about the food, they have their own creamer and both it and the coffee are really good - just like a really good simple cup of coffee. 

Things to know:
- It's cash only
- It's small - they only have a few booths and a counter, but they turn them over fairly quickly and I'd say its worth the wait. Just don't come here with a big group (4+)."
475,"Large portions, delicious food = great value.  
I couldn't decide if I wanted raspberry or chocolate chip pancakes, so to compromise I was going to have one of each. The waitress recommended getting raspberries and chocolate chips in both. So glad I did because they were amazing, AND HUGE!

The kitchen and sink are right in front of the bar counter and I loved it! Reminded me when I visit home and walk in the kitchen to the smell of bacon and eggs. They blast rock music and it made for a really fun atmosphere. The servers are nice and keep it real, and gave great advice on some other local places to visit."
476,"Came here for Bruch and it was such a nice surprise. The intimate feel of the place makes it seem like you're one of the locals just there for your breakfast. Got the hash browns, eggs and chocolate chip pancake. Good! The hash browns were more mashed than the shredded which was an enjoyable change to what I'm used to. Also if you want hot sauce they bring you a whole bucket with a variety of flavors, it's not a one spice type of Tabasco place (though the do have Tabasco). Given its size, I thought they would have one unisex bathroom but they actually had two rooms-one men's one woman's- and in that they had a little sink station and then a separate room for the toilet! Delightful."
477,"This diner lived up to its reputation! We had to wait a little bit, but it was worth the wait! We sat at the bar top and ordered French toast, scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage, and the peppered steak burger. It was all very delicious! The sausage was great quality and not processed. We got to watch the cooks/servers work, and they definitely know what they're doing! Btw it's cash only! They even offered us hot coffee while we waited for a seat! Great service and food!"
478,"I had the special blueberry grilled muffin and veggie omelet with hash brown and toast. My husband had the amazing hobo hash browns. It's an open kitchen, everything is made fresh in front of you.  

Best place for breakfast in Portland Maine!! We waited for an hour to get a seat! The waiting time in this diner is over an hour during anytime of the day, but it is worth it. The guy at the reception bribed me with a free grilled muffin to give up a table of 4. Friendly people. Nice place to start your day. This is a cash only place."
479,"Great food. Staff was sweet and fun. The grilled muffin was amazing. Quick service. Small, decor is nothing fancy, just stuff they thought was fun."
480,"I really don't enjoy the ""I Got Yelled at at Marcy's"" thing they've got going.  

I was seated at the bar which is fine.  The chicken salad club had too much mayo for my taste.  My husband's shaved beef was good but the hash browns were the best thing!  A great golden brown crust intertwined with soft potatoes made these beyond perfect!"
481,"This place is the real deal.  We were told an hour wait, the reality was more like 20 minutes, which was nice. 

I got the Neuge, because when you see Taylor Ham on a breakfast sandwich, you order it.  I also got a side of bacon, which was six pieces of maple smoked goodness.  

The coffee was piping hot and the flavored cream was a nice touch.  I also appreciated that our waitress never let our cups approach getting empty.  

Great spot and highly recommended."
482,"The place has little ventilation. Super hot inside even when only 70 degrees outside. Waited for 20 min to get a table and watched as another couple that came in after me was seated. There was another empty booth available. I asked the hostess to be seated there. She told me no, she was going by a list. I pointed to my name on her list with the couple's name under mine crossed out. She said she called my name and no one answered. I told her I was standing beside her the entire time and that she most certainly didn't. She again stated she did in her snide millennial tone. I walked out never to visit again. Bayside American Cafe has better food without the snark."
483,"Looking for a great breakfast while in Portland, look no farther, you've found it at Marcy's Diner.  But know this, get there early as the place is small and the line happens quickly.  The wait staff are all so friendly and they make you feel like you're a local or one of the family, it was awesome.  I had a full and hearty veggie omelette which was excellent.  I discovered the most delicious raisin bread I've ever had; just full of tons of plump raisins.  There were 4 of us and even though the restaurant was packed we had great service, delicious food and we absolutely did not feel rushed.  This is a must visit, you'll be happy to say you've had breakfast at Marcy's Diner!"
484,This was one of the best breakfast places I have ever eaten in.  We were on vacation from Miami Florida and my cousin recommended this place. It is small and cozy and we did not have to wait long (it was Thursday). We were greeted by the friendly staff. We first ordered the grilled blueberry muffin.  It was so good we ordered one to go! The eggs were cooked perfectly. The pancakes are the size of hubcaps so my son only ordered one. He ate the whole thing! The hashbrowns were cooked well also. I wish we had a Marcy's diner in Miami!
485,"We were in town for a concert a few weeks ago. Have never been to this area. Pleasantly surprised to have found this diner. Major plus- it happened to be on a Monday which is apparently metal Monday. Fantastic! The playlist was amazing, and the food was delicious. Wish I had a place like this in my hometown!"
486,"I did NOT get yelled at while at Marcy's - I guess I was well behaved enough. Actually, we had a couple of nice breakfasts here while in Maine. The service was quick and friendly and the food was abundant. 

The pancakes were pretty good. I see why that mom ordered three giant ones for her screaming baby. The coffee was ok. The meats were pretty saturated with salt. Fortunately, the buckets of hot sauce and easy access syrup can help fix that."
487,"Fantastic breakfast spot.
Nice atmosphere.
Fresh, hot, delicious breakfast.
Incredible homemade muffins.
Outstanding staff with very friendly and efficient service"
488,"Breakfast here was tasty but not anything mind-blowing. I had basic eggs, hashbrowns and toast. For toast they offer Texas toast cooked on the grill, which is excellent, but the eggs were mediocre and the hashbrowns were undercooked and had a VERY strong flavor of pork (none of my other grilled food had this flavor, so I think there was pork fat or something like that added to the hashbrowns as opposed to simply the effects of being cooked next to bacon on the grill). I don't normally eat pork and the flavor was strong enough that I had to give the hashbrowns to my husband.
I also had a grilled blueberry muffin. The muffin itself was good - very large and with a nice crumbly topping, but the fact that it was so large meant that not much of the muffin's surface area got grilled. I've had grilled muffins elsewhere that I liked more.
We only had to wait about 15 minutes but we went at 9 am on a Friday. I would say this place is a good option if you can catch it without a wait, but it's not something I'd wait in a long line for. It's a fairly standard diner, homey and with tasty, cheap greasy spoon food, but compared to many other Portland eateries it's not very unique."
489,"Hubby and I were in town today. No kiddos, were celebrating our anniversary and Thanksgiving this week. 
We were still on California time, so we barely made it in time to grab some of the best damn food we've ever had!
If you can imagine the best ever comfort food and multiply it by 10000, you got Marcy's Diner!
The actual restaurant is very cozy. It's an open grill with bar top service and a few booths. 
Daily specials are posted on chalk boards colorfully displayed underneath the cool merchandise display 
We ordered the grilled banana muffin and grilled blueberry muffin, quiche, potatoes and French Toast. 
Everything was beyond delicious! Servings are plentiful. I had to take a to go box for the yummy potatoes! 
The servers are friendly and on top of their game.  Did I say they also have awesome coffee!? 
This is a one of a kind gem located in the heart of downtown Portland. 
Don't miss this place next time you're in town. You won't regret it! 
I'll be back."
490,"Marcy's is the one and only restaurant I dined in during my 24 hour stay in Portland and we stumbled upon it early Sunday morning when we awoke in our hotel room, were starving and craved more than the complimentary continental breakfast being offered.  

We arrived around 9:30 a.m. to a full house!  Mind you, this diner is very small; there are around 10-12 counter seats and 5 or so very narrow booths.  Thankfully, we only had about a 5 minute wait but we were both glad we walked in when we did because within minutes there were 4 other couples waiting to be seated.

Service is fast and friendly.  Typical breakfast diner atmosphere but it was definitely warm and welcoming.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive.  I didn't poke much around at the menu because I usually eat the same things for breakfast; I ordered 2 eggs, hash-browns and an english muffin.  My date ordered eggs over-easy, hash-browns, hash and an english muffin which he enjoyed and ate every last bite where as I, on the other hand, am a food snob.  The scrambled eggs were watery and warm and the hash-browns were undercooked, the only thing I really liked was the english muffin.  Even the coffee was cheap tasting.  

I've always been of the opinion that it's kind of hard to screw up breakfast foods, but I guess I was wrong.  Was it the absolute worst food I've ever eaten?  No.  Would I suggest that one of my friends stop by Marcy's for a fulfilling and delicious breakfast?  No."
491,"Excellent hot breakfast! Quick staff. Been there several times and each time it was consistent and delicious! 

The owner is a BOSS!! She runs that place tight and doesn't skip a beat! Very smooth and amazing to see how quick they are!"
492,"Why wouldn't you eat at Marcy's Diner? It's a kick@$$ atmosphere, old school breakfast diner where the owner works her tail off for her customers. Friendly, fun, metal Mondays, for goodness sake.

The food is awesome breakfast fare and American lunch, there's literally something for everyone, the grilled muffins are especially tasty! Everyone is happy, loves their job and the clientele feel the same way. It's a bustling cozy place. You'll love it!"
493,"4 stars for service
2 stars for food overall, except the grilled raspberry muffin, which is def a 5 star! 

I had heard about Marcy's for a long time and wanted to try it out, especially after it made news over the infant tantrum vs owner spectacle that went down a few months ago. 

First of all, service we got was excellent. No shrieking baby helps, I'm sure. They were friendly, warm and fun. Although our 1 hour wait on a Saturday at 11 was no fun at all. 

Our server had recommended her personal favorite: the raspberry muffin grilled, and that was highlight of our breakfast. 

Marcy's has pretty typical greasy diner food, but I was sorely sorely disappointed with the cinnamon swirl pancake of the day that we ordered. There was hardly any cinnamon flavor and the whole pancake itself tasted like bacon grease. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my bacon bits. Just not when I'm expecting a sweet, cinammony pancake! (for that, I have to say that Bayside cafe has it down!) 

The breakfast burrito I also ordered was alright. It wasn't a standout, just tasted...fine. Lots of cheese and grease with the eggs. 

Price was really inexpensive. Good place to go for greasy grub if you don't mind the wait (or the grease). I probably will be around the block trying out other diners before heading back."
494,"Small diner that seats about 25 people. Very cozy atmosphere. Food is just ok, I wouldn't come back. 

I got the B2 - 2 eggs, ham steak, hash browns, toast $6.50. Portions are fairly large considering the price but the food is under seasoned. The hash Browns were very mushy so barely ate them.The ham steak was recommended by the staff and it was the best thing on my plate. Get the TIGER SAUCE to go with it!

Got a regular coffee, it is just ok

Got here at noon and they were out of one of the specials and only had two muffins left so GET THERE EARLY.

The only source of air are fans so it's pretty warm. If you are looking for have a meal while enjoying the breezy Maine weather, this is not it."
495,"This small eater is great with excellent food all around and low prices.  Just a block and a half from the Portland Museum of Art.

We had one dish with corned beef hash, potatoes, and rye bread toast.  The portions were generous, the food came out piping hot, and everything was really fresh and delicious, tasting like homemade.  The other plate was a steak and cheese sandwich with high quality beef, which you usually do not get.  The onions were perfectly done.  Also a big portion.

Service was superb.  The waitperson came by frequently to refill our glasses and sincerely wanted to know how we liked our meal.  

The next time I am in Portland or passing through, this will be the first food establishment I hit.
Marcy's truly deserved the 5 star rating from other reviewers."
496,"What an awesome traditional American diner! Fast service and great food. On a Wednesday morning in October, I was surprised at how packed this diner stays-- I guess that just goes to show how popular this place is. Anyways, if you're visiting Portland for a few days, this is a fun place to stop for breakfast."
497,"I've been to Marcy's many times. The service and the food have always been excellent and I love having it as an alternative to the other two large and busy diners in the area, not that Marcy's isn't busy on any given weekend morning, it can be.

The quiche is my absolute favorite, speaking as a guy who isn't normally into such things. I ordered it once on a whim and it reminded me of quiche I have a little cafe on a side street in Paris; rich but lite, huge portion with a side. Just a great breakfast, lunch or dinner (when they're open at dinner time).

The owner is always friendly when she's in, chatting up the guests and the pancakes are the best I've had in Portland. You can't go wrong here!"
498,Great food and great service. We've been here twice. The wait staff is so good. Make you feel wonderful even when you are starving and grumpy. Food is fresh and delicious.
499,"This place was just awesome. It has an older vibe but they had newer music playing. We arrived around 7:30am on a saturday morning and we sat down right away. The food was delicious, iced coffee was strong, and the bill wasn't outrageous. It was a perfect start to our day. I would definitely return here !"
500,"Every breakfast and brunch my family and I have eaten at The Sinful Kitchen has been amazing. I like their Benedicts, my wife likes their Omelettes and Huevos Rancheros, and the kids prefer the stuffed French Toast. 
The service is wonderful, fast and friendly despite them being extremely busy most mornings. 
Easily my favorite breakfast/brunch spot, I'd give Sinful Kitchen 6/5 stars if I could."
501,"Good food but location needs lots of work.

Get a Rez there us ALWAYS a wait. 

4 stars for food. 4 meals here and no disappointments. 

5 stars for amazing consistent service.

1 star for making us wait outside in the rain and sleet in 20 degree weather.

1 star for HORRIBLE parking situation and muddy pit we had to walk though to get in. 

This location used to be a Latin restaurant and had the same problems, horrible parking. The front of the restaurant is mud. You have to walk through mud to get to the front door. There is zero waiting, if you table isn't ready you will be asked to wait outside."
502,"Today was the last day of my vacation and I wanted celebrate it by going to brunch. My husband and I have wanted to try the Sinful Kitchen for a while but we could never get it together enough to enjoy a weekend brunch there. 
We arrived around 12:30 and there were ample parking spots, better yet when we stepped inside there a few empty tables. Lucky us! 
We were seated in the front window and ordered Bloody Marys. Very good Bloody Marys to boot. 
I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, They were excellent. Refried beans, cheese,eggs, salsa, sour cream, chive and avocado on a flour tortilla, seriously what's not to love. The home fries were perhaps the best I've ever had. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict which looked amazing but I was to busy enjoying my own dish I didn't get a bite of his dish. I overheard our server telling another couple that brunch on the weekends were insanely busy and the wait can be an hour or more.  I'm happy we went on a weekday AND the last day of our vacation. My only regret is that I bought a Portland Dine Around card this year and I forgot to use it. Oh well, next time because there will be a next time"
503,"I've been to my fair share of brunches, and this does not disappoint. The environment is so warm and cozy, it feels like you're being made a delicious meal at a friend's house. The other nice thing we found out is that you can make reservations here, which is rare for brunch places! Let me start with the lavender lemonade mimosa- holy crap, I discovered heaven in a glass. I was very tempted to ask if they would consider selling me a gallon of this to take home. One of my favorite parts was that the tables are covered with brown paper and every table had a jar of crayons so you can doodle while waiting. There are pieces of patron's drawings up on display too which was so fun to look at!
Moving on to the food- we had a hard time making a decision because we were overwhelmed by how good everything sounded. We finally went with a steak and cheese omelette (with mushrooms, onions and peppers added) and a bbq pork omelette. We also split the stuffed French toast, whose filling changes daily- today our options were mocha or peanut butter bacon. We went with mocha but the other one sounded like it would be such a decadent treat yo-self option. The omelettes were served with hash browns and toast, all of which were delicious. The French toast completely stole the show though- wow. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other delightful looking dishes too!"
504,The food here is yummy! LAmb bacon is really good! Didn't know that even existed. I had the egg white scrambled which was delicious with turkey sausage mushrooms cheese spinach so good. Home fries also some of the best I've had. Eggs were poached to perfection. Nice cozy environment friendly staff. Highly recommend!
505,"This is a fun and funky place to come for brunch.  It's ALWAYS packed when we go, so either go early or prepare to wait.

The lamb bacon is odd sounding but great tasting.  I have to echo others who say that it's a tad expensive to do every weekend, but as close as it is to home with great food, I'd say we'll be here at least once a month.

Bonus: you can write your novel on the table while you wait for your food."
506,"This is a pretty solid brunch place. This was more of a 3.5 star place for me, but I rounded up because the service is good. I got the lobster benedict, which was GREAT. Definitely get this if you want one of the benedicts. It is much better than the other options. The home fries it came with were a little burnt, and didn't have much flavor. 

For brunch, there are quite a few drink options. Parking is a bit limited here in their lot. I don't recall too much street parking if you can't score a spot in their lot though. I love the drawings they have inside from local artists. They also give you crayons and brown paper on your table if you want to draw while you wait for your food!

I would come back and try this place again the next time I go back to Portland."
507,"This was the best brunch I had on my trip to Portland, ME.  I can give you one bit of advice, make reservations although we got a table in about 20 minutes just walking in.  

The one item you have to get is a side of lamb bacon, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I could have eaten a pound of it!!!  We ordered the stuffed French toast, pizza waffle, and the Friends with Benedict with many options but we got the crab.  I don't think there are many bad choices on this menu.  I will return to Maine just for the Sinful Kitchen!!!"
508,"Top brunch spot! It's out of the crazy downtown area and in what used to be a house. It's not your typical restaurant set up but it's a must try. Especially-- If you are gluten free--all of their menu items can be made to accommodate you! The owner is GF and takes it seriously. Not only is it GF but it's also really really good. This place is always busy no matter what time I've gone. The Huevos Rancheros with Pulled Pork, is my absolute favorite. We like to begin with splitting a side of French toast or a GF waffle with strawberries and whipped cream, you know just to warm up. It's definitely comfort food and a nice sunny atmosphere. You can draw on the table (I've seen 5 yr and 60 yr both loving this). The staff is SO nice. They always remember us and our preferences. They really make you feel welcome and are happy to have you. Looooove Sinful Kitchen."
509,"Gotta love it when you find a good spot for brunch after a long flight! Me and my husband were starving after an early morning flight and headed straight to The Sinful Kitchen from the airport. The restaurant is an old house convert and has all the charms of an old building. We were seated right away and we put in our orders in a while.

I ordered a tofu scramble with roasted veggies and my husband went with their waffle pizza. The restaurant was courteous enough to replace the eggs with jackfruit bbq on the waffle pizza. Portion sizes are great. The tofu scramble was seasoned really well and the waffle pizza was very flavorful too. The downside might be you might want to eat it quickly since it started getting soggy after a while. 

While waiting for our orders we doodled away with the crayons that were placed at the table. While we enjoyed the quirk, the doodling went on for a long time due to the wait time in getting our orders out from the kitchen. The waitress was very kind in checking on us from time and time and apologizing for the delay. I am going with 4 starts since on the particular day we went, the weather was extremely gloomy which made the place pretty hot to sit in. Not sure if the air conditioning was not working. When we are in Portland the next time I'll still definitely want to go to this place to try out various other veggie options."
510,"I dream of brunch in all of it's forms: hollandaise sauce, eggs, sausage, bloody marys...I could go on.

I had heard of the Sinful Kitchen and their brunch options for quite some time and I have been waiting to try it! My husband and I decided to give it a go one weekend, and I'm glad we did.

First off, the Sinful Kitchen is one of those brunch places that is nestled on the outskirts of Portland. There is nothing flashy about the building or the sign, so it can easily be looked over, but it is definitely worth the try! The building of the Sinful Kitchen is very home-like, and parking is very limited, especially in the winter time. Make sure to plan in advance to come earlier, because if there is no parking in their parking lot, it's a challenge to find parking elsewhere! 

Walking into the Sinful Kitchen, I was instantly brought back to memories of when I was younger and I would go to brunch with my parents. The venue is very small and intimate, but it has such a diner-like charm that I can appreciate. When we entered the building, we were happily greeted by the hostess, and all the other staff was incredibly friendly. 

Looking at the Sinful Kitchen menu, there are options to suit everyone's brunch wants. Ranging from breakfast burgers, to benedicts, to omelettes, etc. I was drawn to the El Diablo omelette, which had ghost pepper cheese and jalape√±os, and it was served with ghost pepper sausage, home fries, and toast. The omelette itself was basic, but the ghost pepper sausage was amazing, and the home fries were my absolute favorite. They were perfectly seasoned and full of flavor.

Unfortunately, we did not try the bloodies because we were going to another event that day, however, they looked amazing and the price was VERY reasonable. $10 for a good-sized bloody mary with a side of ghost pepper sausage?! I will definitely be back, even if it's just to taste their bloodies."
511,wow ! The family and I went here over  the weekend and all I have to say is this place is amazing. The ambiance is very eclectic and fun. Very kid friendly and delicious food . Check it out !
512,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Portland. My bf and I tried their El Diablo omelet (It's spicy!!), Greek Egg Benedict, and French toast. The portions were big and the food were delicious. We love it and we highly recommend this place :)"
513,"My absolute favorite brunch spot in Portland for amazing service, food, and drinks. Sinful kitchen has specials that I wish they kept year round! For brunch, I recommend the huevos rancheros, Maine crab benedict, and ham & swiss omelette. GET THE MANMOSA. You will not regret it!"
514,"This Sinful Kitchen never fails. It's an option outside of town that always delivers a solid breakfast. 

They've recently updated their menu, and that is definitely not a let down. Quite the opposite to expand their options. 

The breakfast burger is a family favorite for us. The homies won't disappoint. You'll walk out of Sinful Kitchen stuffed to the max! 

The service is so awesome! Our waiter was willing to make any and all accommodations that we asked for. He was great!

We are not gluten free, but the owner is--which means they have many gluten free options.

The needs improvement: parking! It can get really bad in here. They are at the bottom of an apartment building and there are specific places that you can park and it can look really crowded from the parking lot but actually isn't that crowded on the inside. 

Running out of the specials! When you walk in and see the specials, you may get stoked. But, if it's late in the day, those might not be an option for you. 

They also often take call aheads, so you can have a table waiting for you when you get there."
515,"This was our favorite breakfast during our trip to Portland! The restaurant is a charming converted house and the hostess and waitresses were all super friendly. I got the pulled pork omelet and my boyfriend got the pulled pork eggs Benedict cause we love porking and forking 

There was sooo much pulled pork (house made) in the omelet which I appreciate! So good. The eggs benny was also very good and surprisingly different flavor profile because of the hit of salsa on top."
516,"A quaint place in an unsuspecting part of town. Definitely downtown Portland worthy, on the outskirts just over the Westbrook line. The menu wasn't huge but had so many delicious options it made it hard to decide. On the advice of our very friendly waitress, we got a 'side' of the Pb & fluff stuffed French toast to share, we had a few bites before our main dishes arrived and a couple bites after for 'desert'. I got the huevos rancheros (minus the refried beans) with bacon cooked in and home fries on the side. The bacon could've been a cooked a bit more for my liking but they were excellent, they had a chipotle sour cream drizzle on top that could've been a tad spicier, didn't really notice much of a taste from it. I also got a side of ghost pepper sausages which were very hot and very tasty! The home fries where good, a little crispy which I enjoy. My friend got one one the specials which was jalape√±o popper eggs Benedict which she said were excellent. 
As with most breakfast/brunch spots, it's not very big but we went at a good time so didn't need to wait but the tables were constantly full. We were told they do accept reservations and encourage that on the weekends as they can have a line outside for up to an hour or more. There is parking on site, but not a ton of spots so carpool there if you can. 
Oh they also had some delicious sounding brunch cocktails but we didn't get any this time. baileys pumpkin coffee and a salted caramel apple mimosa. 
I will definitely be back!"
517,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile! Being a vegetarian, the jackfruit has me curious. Everything was solid. Not as unique as I was hoping for but everything I'd want in a breakfast really. The only thing I didn't like was that our waitress was eating her lunch in the corner while returning with food her mouth to check on us. Unprofessional. Eat in the back. We also were missing silverware while she was enjoying her meal. Just a little thing."
518,"This is a great brunch spot located in a small house-type building, it really feels like you are going to someone's home for brunch. Our group of 4 ordered a range of breakfast and more lunch-y type items and everything was outstanding. I personally had the pulled pork sandwhich and really loved the blueberry slaw that came with it. 

I highly recommend the nitro cold brew if you love coffee. It is fantastic. The cocktails also looked good if you are up for a boozy brunch, though we didn't try them on this trip. 

The only reason for knocking off a star is that the wait (even on a weekday) was crazy long and the staff didn't do a great job of estimating the time it would take to get us in. We checked in after the original time estimate and then were told it would be at least another 20 minutes to wait."
519,"This was my second time visiting sinful kitchen. We went around 12:00 PM for Brunch and the wait time was about 25 minutes which I thought was reasonable for a Sunday, not having a reservation and taking into consideration the size of the restaurant. They allowed us to take a walk in the neighborhood and gave us a call when our table was ready. 

+Service: Waitress and hostess were both very friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were constantly being filled and waitress reassured us that our food was on the way and checked in multiple times throughout the meal. That being said - food did take a little longer than I expected to be done. I want to guess about 50 minutes-1 hour. 
+Food: Amazing. I got an egg white scramble and was expecting a bland flavor because that is what I am used to with egg whites. Nope! The scramble was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles special and loved it. The food was reallyyyyy good making me okay with the wait time. 
+Price: Eh, not too bad. For two entrees & two kombuchas our fill was 35 dollars. 
+Atmosphere: Fun (the tables have brown wrapping so you can draw pictures with crayons while waiting, there is a ukelele you are welcome to play, interesting art on the walls, and relaxing music like norah jones in the background) But it was HOT HOT HOT. I'm guessing no air conditioner in there - made for a slightly sweaty, uncomfortable brunch."
520,"Great brunch spot! A couple weeks ago my husband and I ventured over to the Sinful Kitchen to try out a new brunch spot and to use our Portland Dine Around card ($5 off). I have to say that I was quite impressed. 
Beware, the parking is limited and it is on a fairly busy street with not much parking options outside of their lot.  

The restaurant itself is very cute. Pretty sure it was previously a residential home that was renovated into a restaurant! 
We came on a Saturday around 10A and we must have walked in the door at the perfect moment as we surprising didn't have to wait for a table. 

The menu offered a variety of delicious sounding brunch options which certainly made me struggle in deciding what to get. Once I thought I had decided what to order, I then realized that there was a board in the corner with all of the specials on it which then brought me back to square one. 
I ended up going with the Chorizo omelet which was a special for the day.... and it was really tasty. The omelet was FILLED very generously with a good amount of chorizo sausage. So delicious. 

They also had this great turbo iced coffee which was very tasty and really perked me right up.

The service was exceptional and our server seemed very happy and eager to provide great assistance/service. 

Given that we had afternoon plans we did not drink any alcoholic beverages, however the Bloody Mary's looked fantastic!! We will certainly come back to give these a try!"
521,"Delicious food, very kind and attentive wait staff. Very popular but you can make reservations. Honestly can't go wrong."
522,Excellent little brunch place! The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly as well! Only minor (very minor) complaint is that the coffee wasn't  very good.
523,"This place is out of the way for us but cute and welcoming. Had brunch there last Friday and ordered coffee, the huevos rancheros with pork, and the pork omelet. The coffee was excellent! Hot, aromatic, and rich. Best huevos rancheros I've had a in a while and I loved the flavor layers with the corn tortillas, pork, and refried beans rather than the standard black beans. My husband's omelet was super tasty. Thick and soft toast looked homemade maybe? Great homefries. 
    The service was good. Server was friendly and quick with recommendations. Coffee was kept refilled and the server asked how we liked it while making sure to bring fresh half and half (not whole milk). 
    They could up their jam game (comes in standard plastic containers). Fresh fruit jam would have completed this awesome meal! 
   All in all can't wait to go back!"
524,"Absolutely some of the most enjoyable breakfast food I've had in ages. Gluten free, vegan and regular options, plus an array of excellent cocktails make this an absolute must for brunch enthusiasts. Friendly waitstaff, very chill environment, completely from scratch kitchen and great music. My bloody mary was to die for. I cannot sing the praises of the Sinful Kitchen enough. Just visit."
525,"Absolutely lovely! Friendly staff, cozy environment, great food and parking! Will definitely come back with the Family on the weekend, with resos! P.S. they have choloula!"
526,"Tried twice. Both times the food was bland, greasy & unappealing. Owner was present and friendly but also sort of arrogant? It was an expensive breakfast that left us unsatisfied. With so many delicious breakfast/brunch offerings in the city I would be hard pressed to ever return."
527,"Had the diablo omelet which comes with a side of ghost pepper sausage. Very spicy and awesome. The cheese and jalape√±os inside the omelet really brought the heat. The ghost pepper sausage was about as spicy as a spicy Italian sausage. Quaint atmosphere, very hole in the wall. Worth the visit. Lots on the menu to return for."
528,Great local fare in a homey house! The portion sizes are generous and they know how to cook! I had the corned beef hash and coffee! This place is waaaaaasy better than your average local diner. Try it out!
529,"Make a reservation the night before; you won't be disappointed. The wait is typically an hour or so. We made a reservation for 10am, and walked directly to our table. The servers are friendly and welcoming. The food is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything. The eggs Benedict with Maine crab comes with a side of potatoes; DELICIOUS. We ordered a side of BBQ jackfruit...basically pulled pork taste and texture but it is vegetarian; it was so good. Coffee is great. Pricing is great; see photo of sample check for two!"
530,This was by far the best breakfast my husband and I have ever had! We ordered the Breakfast Waffle Pizza and the Florentine Benedict. Amazing. The service was quick and our waitress was so sweet and very attentive. Thank you for a great start to our morning!
531,Awesome breakfast place. Host/owner was very nice. Took good care of me and my guest who needed gluten free food.  I had the yummy breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage. The sausage was moist and a perfect compliment to my eggs. I can't wait to return and have some blueberry sausage.
532,"After reading several reviews we decided to try out the Sinful kitchen as the general consensus is a great place and also we didn't want to venture into the busy city. 
Thankfully when we arrived there was a table open so we were able to get a seat immediately. From other patrons that had to wait however the average wait time varied from 10-20 minutes... it's worth it if you get stuck waiting. 
Our server was very friendly and attentive. She gave us enough time to look over the menu and when we were finally ready she returned with our beverages and food in a timely fashion. 
We order mocha coffee, (Hot chocolate and coffee) and they were very good. Nice and hot. Not too sweet. For breakfast I ordered the bbq pulled pork omelette. Although it has jalape√±os, it wasn't too spicy. The hash browns were amazing. I normally don't care for them but these were great. They were flavorful and had the right amount of crisp. My SO had a Belgian waffle, he said it was very good. He consumed it in about 5 minutes. 
All and all I would definitely stop here again if I was in the area."
533,"We flew into town for a week on the Maine coast, and this was our first meal of the week. It was so good, we stopped in to make it our last meal when flying out! The huge menu changes a bit, so pay attention to the specials on the wallboard. Both times, our servers were helpful and attentive. Food came out hot and delicious. I had never had a hash before, except at camp as a kid, and that was not a pleasant experience. The steak hash I got on the first trip was so full of flavors and was such a huge serving, I couldn't finish it! I took it ""for the road"" and nibbled on it throughout the day.
My travel partner is a bit picky when it comes to eggs, but she dove in both times we ate here. If you're flying in, just go ahead and plan to drive straight there. And, if you're lucky enough to live nearby, you probably already know about this spot. Enjoy it!"
534,"I wish there was another star so I could give it six! Fantastic experience! Scratch kitchen, variety of options, simple yet cozy decor and ambience. Food presentation was on point and food was delicious. Definitely returning."
535,"The only issue I have with Sinful is getting a table! But, if you call ahead or arrive before 9a, you're in. I visited today for probably the 6th time and finally tried the huevos rancheros and it was amazing. The tortilla was crispy, my eggs were cooked as asked and the salsa was so fresh. The home fries pack a little peppery punch that is full of flavor. Best part, cocktails available! This morning I had a cranberry-blood orange mimosa that was to die for. Every drink I've had is hand crafted deliciousness. A favorite breakfast spot!"
536,"Not so hidden breakfast gem. I started intermittent fasting recently, which means I skip breakfast and lunch every day... might have to make a cheat day just for Sinful Kitchen alone. 

Their French toast special is always on point. If you have a sweet tooth, and it sounds like you'll like it... get it, because you're going to love it. They have multiple original takes/variations of your traditional breakfast/brunch platters. For the spice lovers like myself, they have some ghost pepper sausage incorporated meals that are fantastic."
537,"Woooooooooow. I can't tell you the orgasmic explosion in my mouth when I had the Mother's Day special Lobster Benedict. Every bite was incredible. It's one of those dishes that leave this amazing after taste in your mouth. You're full, but you can't stop eating it! The home fries were perfect too!! Cooked to its crunchy yet soft potato potential and seasoned perfectly, not too salty not to bland. The place is cute and quiet. Has a really homey feel but you know something amazing is coming out of the kitchen. It's truly a hidden gem."
538,"Perhaps the best breakfast of all time. And, I don't take that lightly as we have been to some great places. From the service, to the coffee, to the ghost pepper bloody mary to the andouille benedict, 5 stars plus across the board. This is a MUST find if you are close enough to go!"
539,"This was a new experience. Sinful kitchen looks like I walked into someone's house and sat down for brunch. Looking from the outside, looks like someone's home. There is a decent amount of parking in its parking lot.

We had reservations made, which might have not been necessary since it was not that busy. For beverage we had the Roibos tea: very earthy.  First time trying such a tea.

The staff was great. Very attentive and our order came relatively quickly.  But that is where the excitement ends. Our waitress warned us that the Diablo delight was super spicy. It was underwhelmingly,  not spicy or flavorful. Our omelette had pickled jalape√±os in it but there was no salt or pepper. Our home fries was a little burned. The wheat bread toast was the best thing on the plate. Lightly buttered and not burnt.

The French toast stuffed with white chocolate and macadamia  nuts was also underwhelming.  There was no taste to it. Could barely taste the white chocolate. 

What makes this is the experience.  The staff were great and a nice break after a week of exams."
540,"All things on fleek. It's cozy, there are breakfast tacos, there is a parking lot,  there is a ukulele that says ""play me,"" and there is great service. What is not to like about all of those things individually, let alone all together?

On my first visit, I had essentially wanted breakfast tacos, but I was too hungover and not alert enough to see that there was a large chalkboard with specials written in large letters. I basically ended up ordering a deconstructed taco, which was actually fine (and yummy). The only complaint I had about this previous meal was that the onion in the salsa was very strong (too strong for my tastebuds). Yet, it was a minor detail. The waitress was super friendly, attentive, and even gave me a full rundown on this new nitro coffee phenomenon. Like love, this was like one of those ""find it when you're not looking for it"" kind of places; then once you have it, you don't know how you ever lived without it. 

This most recent visit (still not all that alert, but with memory of my previous dining), I got the breakfast tacos as listed on the chalkboard, and I was quite satisfied. Actually, the first bite was beyond my expectations.  The corn tortilla  was pleasantly toasted and flavorful, and the onions in these tacos were saut√©ed. Our waitress was a different girl, but she was also very friendly. Santa clearly won't be delivering any coal to any workers here. 

My least favorite part of the meal was when the food was gone. Oh, and that my boyfriend has now had two opportunities to serenade me with a ukulele and he has not. Alas, babe, if you're reading this, I have three words for you: you owe me."
541,Best pork Benny I've had. It's not too far from Portland and the wait is usually quicker than most upscale brunches in town. Great back of house staff is able to do gluten free options for almost every menu item- I never come here enough.
542,"What a cool spot, away from downtown in a converted 3 floor home. Menu is a bit small, but eclectic and good.
I had the tofu/veggie scramble and Mom had a veggie huevos with 2 poached eggs, both our our meals were great. I think it would be great if the kitchen could add a few more savory items to the menu, maybe some other spicy dishes as well?"
543,"I loved the interesting little house this place is in. Nice art on the walls, friendly staff. The food was delicious and there were unique specials to choose from. I couldn't go for the weird French toast options but I was still impressed by them. Would go again!"
544,"We had the blueberry stuffed French toast and a steak hash with eggs--first of all, that French toast was amazing. Second, the potatoes were perfectly seasoned and actually crispy!! I have a high bar for potatoes and these were able to exceed expectations. I highly recommend making reservations or coming on a weekday to make sure you're able to get in here! Make sure to draw a picture on your table top paper and maybe it'll even get posted on the wall!"
545,"The tofu scramble is amazing! Love to see vegan and gluten free options at breakfast places, and I've tried them all in the area and this is by far the best I've encountered. The cold brew is also sooo good. The best part about this place though is the service. The employees are super friendly and accommodating. Megan was our server today and she was fantastic. Try this place!!"
546,Food is great atmosphere is relaxing! Choices galore esp if you like spicy stuff! Staff is super nice! Seems to also have wide variety of cocktails too!
547,"I'm gluten-free so was very excited to be able to go out for breakfast and order waffles!

When I first arrived at 8:50 I was the only person there and the music (some kind of current-day pop), to me, was loud and very bass-y. I politely asked the hostess if she could please make it lower? She smiled and said: ""A little."" I thought that was off-putting, and I couldn't discern it being much lower. Not long after the place filled up.

I ordered a plain gluten-free waffle, personal sized real maple syrup and scrambled eggs. The eggs were flattened pieces, like a broken up omelette. My preference is for fluffy scrambled eggs. The waffle, which is really four smaller waffles, was/were delicious! My only less than complimentary feedback about it is that it was a bit pasty in places but I know cooking gluten-free can sometimes take out the fluff and add density. It still was wonderful and I know I'll likely come back for them.

After I finished eating the music still seemed too loud. For a place that specializes in breakfast/brunch I would think that either softer music or played at a lower volume with less bass would be ideal, but maybe I'm too much of a fuddy-duddy."
548,"Might have to give this place the nod for best brunch. I got the huevos rancheros, and it was impeccable. Everything was cooked perfectly! I got some pulled pork on top of it and it had lots of flavor and was very moist. The environment here is also pretty cool. Overall a very very very good spot for brunch."
549,"This great breakfast, brunch, lunch spot is clearly a secret no longer.  The place was jammed for a Weds brunch stop, and the (overheard picky complicated) orders of adjacent patrons stalls the kitchen.
Allow plenty of time- which we unfortunately did not have- to savor:  ""rotating hash"" which was fantastic, house made Bloody Mary mix which I wished could be sold by the bottle, and huge breakfast portions we had to tear ourselves away from.
When we drove past an hour later, after an appointment, I asked my wife if we could stop so I could finish my hash.
Wait staff welcoming, very accommodating, parking ample, deceptively easy to get to from downtown Portland- five minutes by GPS- try it; you will go back."
550,Excellent food and they take the time to make sure our food is dairy free! The gluten free waffles are KILLER!
551,"I could eat breakfast every day here and never be tired of it or disappointed. If they ever rented out bedroom space upstairs, I'd be so there. Sinful Kitchen has a winning blend of unique breakfast creations, friendly staff, background music, and all-around coziness. When I was first searching for a place for breakfast in the area, I focused instantly on their waffle pizza and never faltered from there. And that was indeed what I had for breakfast. Others in my group had one of the specialty omelets of the day, the maple sausage omelet.  And then we noticed they had something listed as an ingredient to some dishes I have as yet never seen elsewhere, lamb bacon.  Our waitress said they acquire it locally too. My home fries - or ""homies"" as they call them - were perhaps the best I've ever had, perfectly crisped and spiced. Coffee came out very quickly after we were seated, and refills came frequently. 

They need to find a way to add the word ""decadent"" to their name as well."
552,Great place for Sunday brunch. Delicious and reasonable prices. Limited seating and parking so get there early.
553,Crazy creative place.  I had the veggie waffle for breakfast.  Small interesting rooms. Great service. You got to go and check out the food.
554,"Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. The lamb bacon though? That shit was to DIE for. Definitely go here, you won't be disappointed"
555,"We found Sinful Kitchen last month and so glad we did!  Fun slight twists and your common breakfast dishes that make them not so common. 
Veggie Waffle Pizza was a treat!!  All the yumminess of a frittata like egg pizza with the sweetness of the maple syrup and waffle...best of both worlds!!  Hubby had the breakfast taco with pulled pork and enjoyed them just as much. We will definitely be returning on a regular - treat - basis!!  Would love to try the Philippine platter shown in the pictures ...we understand it is a special for parties."
556,"It was a pleasure having Dave come and cater our conference today in South Portland. Can't say enough about how great the food was. He was able to provide exactly what we were looking for in the quality as well as quantity. In addition his service was excellent, being available as needed, being kind, courteous, and pleasurable to have at our event. He was quick and efficient in his set up as well as considerate not tearing down his setup in the middle of our training. Can't speak enough about how great our experience was.
Thanks so much for a great event!
Sincerely,
Jeremy"
557,We visited Portland on a busy Labor Day weekend. The breakfast and brunch spots closer to downtown were one + hour wait times so we decided to try The Sinful Kitchen. It is very small but we waited less than 10 minutes. I had the crab and avocado benedict and was very happy.  Service was great also.
558,"When it comes to breakfast in Portland you've got to bring your A game. Unfortunately, I don't feel like this was the case when my wife and I recently ate here.

We arrived on a recent Sunday morning to this understated venue which is very cozy and delightfully decorated. The background music was on point and the wait staff were fantastic. We were delighted to find that they served nitro coffee here which we excitedly tried. 

I decided to try the stuffed French toast of the day, blueberry and my wife had the Belgian waffles. We were both excited to see that they offered turkey sausage as a side in lieu of other products. As neither of us eats pork or red meat this was a pleasant surprise. Both dishes also came with a side of home fries.

My stuffed French toast was ok. A bit sweeter than I would normally get for a breakfast dish, but the portion was very hearty. The turkey sausage was a bit too salty, which my wife agreed with, and the home fries were underwhelming. My wife's Belgian waffles were also just ok. 

The place did fill up quickly and they do recommend a reservation, especially on the weekends.

Overall our experience was just ok. My hope is that maybe this was just an off day, but breakfast/brunch is practically an art form in Portland and there are many high quality places to go. This is a nice place to go and grab some breakfast/brunch and I do hope to return to try some of their other options. 

The big standout of our experience is that they have some pretty fantastic options for people with dietary restrictions, like gluten-free options for just about everything on the menu (which the wait staff actually inquire if you need) and the addition of non-pork/beef options."
559,"Casual atmosphere with plenty of great breakfast/brunch options.

If you desire gluten-free choices, this is a great place to enjoy a meal. 

Our third time here. This morning my husband and I split a slice of delicious gluten-free coffeecake. 

My husband ordered juevos rancheros; he added shaved steak and avocado. 

I ordered a steak bomb, it's served on a fresh bulky roll; I added avocado, jalape√±o and one over easy egg.

The Sinful Kitchen has a number of food options and are happy to tweak menu items. Choices range from stuffed French toast and eggs benedict to omelettes and tofu variations.

Drinks options include: coffee, tea, milk, chocolate milk and a number of unique cocktails.

If you're looking for a basic, traditional American breakfast or something unique, The Sinful Kitchen is a must."
560,"They have wonderful options to choose from! First, our server was great! She was helpful and pleasant. I ordered a very yummy Bloody Mary- it did not disappoint! For food I ordered one of the specials, blueberry cheesecake stuffed French toast- delicious! I took the server's advice and got the pulled pork on the side (really good choice) and very well seasoned home fries.  I will definitely go here again- next time I'm trying the Benedict!"
561,"Yum, yum, yum. Bacon jalapeno stuffed French toast, bottomless coffee, great service. Can't get much better than this place."
562,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Ever since a surgery 3 years ago, I've had to go Gluten Free. It's been a struggle to go out to eat with friends ever since. Either I'm stuck playing it safe ordering just a plain salad or I'm trying to convince them ""it kinda tastes like regular food...u might like it"". 

The sinful kitchen is the first restaurant where my friends and I can go, order off the same menu, and everyone leaves happy and full! I can get everything on the menu gluten free and they can get the exact same dish, but with gluten. The art and crayons at the table just add to that happy feeling of spending time with friends while eating amazing food!!!"
563,Great food and wonderful recommendations around Portland and Maine in general. The cinnamon waffle was really delicious. The lamb bacon was a first and was wonderful.
564,The Benedict with crab was pretty good. The English muffin had a really good crispy texture. Our server was friendly- she gave us a free mimosa for my friend's birthday. I definitely recommend the nitro coffee. It was very smooth.
565,"Ok, these guys have got it down for service! Super friendly waitress and others who welcomed me. I can't stress how important it is to me to have friendly service when I am dining out. I'm happy to report the food was delicious as well! I had the special St.paddys day dish . I asked for a little of the avocado sauce that was for another dish and she gladly added it and I happily enjoyed it! Keep up the good work Folks!"
566,"Brunch spot in the Nason's Corner section of Brighton Ave. The place is small and quaint, with an adjacent parking area on the right side of the renovated house. Six or seven tables in the main dining area. One negative...there is little to no waiting area...so this could be a minor inconvenience in the winter months.

Apparently, the menu is paleo and gluten free. I don't adhere to either, but thought that the menu was varied, and full of excellent choices.

I had a ""Sinful Mary"" for a cocktail....a tequila Bloody Mary. It came with ghost sausage slices, olives, and a pepperonchini pepper. Very colorful and flavorful....Lots of brunch cocktail choices.

I had the breakfast club sandwich, a massive creation of pulled pork, two over easy eggs, pork belly, tomato, lettuce, and mayo. This was a decadent sandwich, which could serve two light eaters. I was up for the challenge, and successfully housed the entire thing. It was accompanied with nicely grilled home fries, perfectly cooked outside, and moist inside. This is a well done meal for the hungry brunch eater.

I've seen a few complaints about pricing....I thought it was reasonably priced for the quality and portion size of the meals. 

All in all, this is a very good spot. Solid 4 stars and I will return again."
567,This is the best meal I've had in a long time. A really cute breakfast place. Bonus perks: the whole menu can be made gluten free!! I'm beyond impressed. They also had kombucha on tap.
568,"Met a friend here at 8am on a Tuesday, hoping to get a table because the line is usually out and around the parking lot. We did get a spot, and enjoyed a lovely breakfast (mine was pulled pork hash with eggs and avocado...amazing). When we left at 9:30, the place was packed. On a Tuesday! That's a good sign for a small local spot."
569,"For those of us who can't eat gluten, Sinful Kitchen is a treasure trove of delightful options, from peanut butter and chocolate ganache Belgian waffles to maple stuffed french toast to ghost pepper omelet with ghost pepper sausage.  Cute local renovated house, this place is small, intimate, and full of little unique details, such as black and white local cottage photos, herb-infused hand lotion in the restroom, and mason jars as hanging lights.  Staff were personable and welcoming. Highly recommend!  By the way, we took a s'more muffin to go."
570,"Friendly staff, clean, great atmosphere- family friendly.  Oh and sinfully delicious food!  We had the steak & cheese hash, the pulled pork & jalape√±os egg Benedict & a ""child's"" meal the size of a grown man's meal... All mouthwateringly good!!"
571,"This is undoubtedly my favorite breakfast spot in town. Everything they make is unbelievable. I love that you can get anything gluten free. I love having the option of waffles or French toast. I pretty much always just get whatever is on the specials board.  Definitely not the Most vegan friendly spot for the vegans out there but they do have a tofu scramble option if you want it. I have heard it's great. If you go on the weekend you have to make reservations. During the week you can often get a table by just walking in. The only thing that is so so there is there coffee, skip the regular coffee and get a nitro coffee which  is delicious."
572,"A great new brunch spot in Portland. Glad to see that while la familia was not able to make it, a new breakfast place has sprung up!

The menu seems to have most of your breakfast standards it also has some devilish different items like a ghost pepper omelet and the stuffed French toasts (with chocolate and cream cheese filling). It is a nice touch that the offer gluten free options for those that have that condition.

In our most recent trip I had the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. They eggs were cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was spot on. Home fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned. I also ordered a side of the stuffed French toast for 6 dollars it could have been the only thing I ate that morning and that would have sufficed.  3 huge pieces of French toast with cream cheese and chocolate frosting layered in between. It is smart thing that they do not publish a calorie count next to these items. 

The inside d√©cor is simple and bright with yellow walls. It is slightly strange that they have white table clothes but then they place a large piece of brown paper over the white table cloth, like it is BBQ joint. 

The waitress was very attentive and friendly giving her recommendations. 

The parking lot can be tight, get there early. And I wish Sinful had some deck space. out back maybe? On the few warm nice days in Maine, breakfast outside is one great pleasure. 

The coffee is spot on but it would be nice to see milk instead of creamers. 

Overall a great spot, will definitely be going back."
573,Came here for breakfast on a week day so it wasn't super busy and there was no wait. Breakfast was delicious and service was good.
574,"Breakfast & a few sandwiches. Nice cocktails and a few beer selections. Yummy, clean plates with an abundance of flavor. Pleasant wait staff. Nice ""homey"" feel."
575,"If you need catering, look no further.  I recently had a sunrise wedding at Fort Williams Park and Sinful Kitchen catered the brunch. The food was so incredible and fresh. The omelettes were the hit of the event! The french toast was not dry or soggy. The morning was truly flawless. People seem to always remember the food at weddings and I'm thrilled to know that the catering did not disappoint!!! You'll be glad you booked them."
576,"I have nothing but good things to say about the Sinful Kitchen. It was everything the reviews were saying and more! A friend and I shared the peanut butter cup waffle and the vegetarian pizza waffle they were both delicious! The ""homies"" were perfect...crispy and full of flavor. I was very impressed with the nitro cold brew made with kahlua too. I would definitely could back again."
577,"Sinful Kitchen opened today so I wouldn't take this review too seriously, but I really enjoyed it. Located after Nason's Corner on Brighton Ave where the (somewhat sketchy looking) La Familia restaurant used to reside, it's easy to miss. Especially because there's currently no sign. The restaurant building is basically a house but inside feels professional, if sparse. There's no real atmosphere yet, but this doesn't bother me for brunch. The hours are 8 am-2 pm Wednesday through Sunday.

The early buzz on Sinful Kitchen has been their focus on gluten free and paleo diets, but I'm neither and barely noticed. The small surcharge next to each menu item for GF provides the only hint. It's a solid menu with the usual brunch favorites along with some creative fare. We started with strong coffee and water but there is a full bar for brunch drinks, which are very reasonably priced. Mimosas are $4.

The El Diablo consisted of ghost sausage, a jalapeno and cheese omelette, homefries and toast (which I never received). This was a fantastic choice. I love spicy and I quickly shed a few tears from the sausage. My friends raved about the waffle and scrambled eggs as well. The neighboring table received stuffed french toast piled a foot high that demands a return trip.

The main flaw for me were the prices. I loved my breakfast, but $15 surpasses most anywhere, including downtown. Nearly everything is in the $10-$15 range, which seems high for the location. The food on opening day was mostly amazing though, so it's worth it and I'll definitely be back."
578,"Our experience at The Sinful Kitchen was okay, not outstanding, but I'm glad we tried it. I will likely be back, next time with a reservation.

We arrived with a party of 5 adults and two kiddos - our friend put our name on the list and told us to wait in the car, because there was no space inside (and too cold to be outside). We did just that and after about 15 minutes our friend said the table was almost ready. We gathered our things (which is kind of a lot with a baby), and headed inside. Boy was she right about no space - there is NO space for waiting, and there were 4+ people from other parties squeezed into the entrance. We juggled our bodies and stuff back and forth as the waitresses moved about. I felt awful about being in the way, yet, knowing our table was almost ready, there wasn't much we could do. The waitresses were nice about it, but their faces showed annoyance.

Once seated we waited for menus and coffee for a while. The place was busy (every table full), but I would expect that on a Saturday morning and would have thought they would have more staff for this busy shift. Once we ordered (after waiting a while) it was hard to get a refill on our coffees, because the wait staff were so busy. 

Our food arrived, and for the most part everyone was happy. I shared a stuffed french toast and a savory polenta dish. The french toast, stuffed with maple & cinnamon, was delicious & decadent. The filling made it like a cinnamon roll, over the top and perfect for my sweet tooth. The potatoes were a little overcooked/burnt, but the seasoning was very good. I was bummed there wasn't a meat alternative (tempeh, vegan sausage) or a discount for a no-meat option. I gave the side of meat to my other half. 

The polenta dish (a special of the day) was good, but left me wanting for something more. It was good, but very heavy, I wouldn't order it again. Others in my party enjoyed their meals mostly, one person ordered the monte cristo and said it was too cheesy, and the cheese didn't taste very good.

Overall the waitstaff were friendly, and when we had their attention, very accommodating and helpful. I was truly shocked that there were only 2 people hosting/seating/serving/cleaning - so I do not fault them for the slow service. In the end we were at the restaurant for over 2 hours, and while the food was good, the overall experience was not so great.

There is parking on site, but it is a busy, small lot so use your compact car not your SUV!

TL/DR Recommendations:
- Make a reservation
- Go with small parties (4 or less)
- Wait outside, if possible
- Share a sweet and a savory dish (perfect balance!)
- Stuffed french toast was the biggest hit at our table!"
579,"This is our second visit to this gem of a restaurant. GF options are plentiful which is a must for us. Today I splurged for the Avocado eggs Benedict with Maine  and an Irish Coffee. My youngest had the special of the day, a maple bacon stuffed French toast which my husband was overly happy to help him finish. Next time we are in town we will stop in again!!"
580,We went during the week which made it easier to grab a table than on Sunday. I loved the huevos rancheros with BBQ jackfruit. The potatoes could have used more flavoring. But overall great price for great food.
581,Best breakfast I've ever had. Fresh ingredients in a cute restaurant where you can draw on the table! I would definitely come back again when I come back to Maine.
582,"Why haven't I heard of this place!?! Maybe since it's a little off the beaten path, The Sinful Kitchen somehow wasn't on my radar. Thankfully, my friend suggested it when we made brunch plans last weekend. 

Here are some highlights:
-The service- our server was attentive and helpful and our water and coffee were refilled constantly. 
-The atmosphere- it's an old house converted to a restaurant. Very homey feeling. The tables were pretty close to each other, but it didn't bother me. 
-Parking!!! The lot was pretty full and I *may* have hit the dumpster while trying to turn around, but parking is parking! 
-The food- Ok so let's talk..... the awesome thing is they have brunch everyday. They have mimosas and bloody mary's that are pretty affordable (think my mimosa was $4) and their menu is varied without being massive. That being said, practically everything on the menu is gluten-free (Yay for my GF friends!!!), BUT if you are vegan or vegetarian, you are NOT going to have many options. Like maybe one option on the whole menu. Thankfully, I eat seafood and some dairy so I had a few options. 

I was pondering one of the sweet options when the ""benny"" section caught my eye. In a weird change of pace I decided to get eggs Benedict w/ crab and lobster (sans bacon) and boy was it tasty! It was SO GOOD that I actually forgot to ask my friend how her dish was (the huevos rancheros). 

My only negative (and this is kind of a weird one so bear w/ me) was the coffee. I believe they serve CBD, but it tasted too strong. Now I know what you're thinking ""oh she doesn't like REAL coffee"". but I do! I love real coffee. I love STRONG coffee, but my friend (who is also a coffee snob/lover) and I both agreed that it tasted bad. 

I noticed that it took a while for our order to come, but that didn't really bother me as it meant they made everything fresh. 

I have been to a lot of brunches in Portland and this one gets top marks! Will definitely be returning w/ my honey."
583,"Had brunch at The Sinful Kitchen today and it was great!!  I enjoyed French toast with home fries and bacon, so fresh and delicious!! My new brunch place!!"
584,My family and I were traveling through Maine on I-95 when my wife spotted a review on Yelp for this place. The food here was exceptional. Our son has food allergies and they accommodated his needs. The waffles were outstanding and Huevos Rancheros were the best I ever had. This is a fabulous breakfast place with outstanding service.
585,The food was excellent! Fresh and unique! My wife got the Gluten Free fried chicken and waffles and I enjoyed the pulled pork breakfast burrito with home fries. We also got the pork belly hash but our eyes were bigger than our stomaches. Too much food for us to handle! We will definitely be back!
586,"Really nice people, cute space, food is delicious but inconsistent. Breakfast pizza needs a different sauce from the bitter marinara. But the staff makes up for the hit or miss food, but not the $$"
587,"Fantastic staff, great food, terrific vibe makes this place a must for not only Sunday brunch but any day brunch. Food is out in a timely fashion and stays hot to the last bite"
588,"Stumbled onto this tiny kitchen situated in an older home while passing through Portland.  We must always find a place with Gluten free options for family members w/Celiac disease.   This little homespun kitchen was just perfect.  One chef in the kitchen, you could see him through the glass panels on the swinging doors.  Everything freshly made, beautifully presented, with some unique choices ( lamb bacon anyone?).  We all enjoyed our breakfasts.  Reasonable prices ( for homemade).  Try it."
589,"This has become our go to place for brunch in Portland! Their food is great, and everything on the menu has a gluten free version so the wife can enjoy her favorites!

We've eaten there a number of times so far (weekly, for a little bit there), and only had to wait once for a table. They have great coffee and are quick to refill your mug.  The staff are always very friendly and make great recommendations and accommodations.

Each day, they have a stuffed french toast special - the one I tried was a vanilla cream cheese filling and was sweet and delightful.  

The Cinnamon Bun Waffle is excellent, and their gluten free version is really good.

I've also had the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, and their hollandaise is light and lovely.  The breakfast potatoes are great and the bacon is always cooked perfectly.

I may have to plan another visit this weekend!"
590,"I love this small neighborhood spot! Sinful Kitchen takes reservations, first great point. They have delicious morning cocktails, second great point. I always get the Bloody Mary, while my friend usually gets the Sinful Mary, which is spicier and is adorned with ghost pepper sausage. Yes, you read right. Ghost pepper sausage. Other morning drinks include mimosas, cider, coffee, etc. 

What I also love about SK is their menu gluten free friendly. The chef here (and at Salty Sally's) can prepare anything gluten free (as he has learned dealing with his own gluten intolerances). I was just there this past weekend and enjoyed a yummy cinnamon coffee cake that was warmed on the flat top griddle. Some of my meal favorites include: eggs Benedict with bacon, ""the bomb"" (pulled pork, peppers, onions on a roll and served with BBQ sauce but I like mine with a side of hollandaise since that feels more like brunch to me), and the waffle pizza (Belgian waffles topped with a large, round scrambled egg mixed with sausage, bacon, and veggies and topped with cheese). My brunch friend always gets huevos rancheros and never deviates! They look delicious with the tortillas, pulled pork, scrambled eggs, and special sauce. 

The staff here is always friendly. It's a laid back vibe here and it's small, but with a reservation, you never have to worry about waiting. It's open everyday from 8-2. Enjoy being Sinful!!"
591,"Amazing! Their eggs rancheros SO good. Get it with pork - the owner is a pro at smoking his own! The salsa/pick de gallo is also AMAZING. Freshly made, hint of cilantro - yum. Service is outstanding - knowledgeable and so friendly... Ask for Leah - she is the BEST! The drinks are delicious and fun. Last time - I had the special - Apple Cider mimosa. 
Also great. Gluten free options galore and very accommodating to allergies/preferences. Decor super adorable. 5 stars all around, every aspect! Must try - you'll want to go back again and again!"
592,"We love The Sinful Kitchen and they take reservations, great service, lovely hollandaise, omelettes, fabulous specials, delightful atmosphere. Food is great (wishing last time we had thought to tell them how we like our eggs poached or wish they had asked, they were a bit undercooked.) it would impress us a bit more if the delish potatoes were less over cooked though. We will keep returning and bringing friends, telling our friends about it too! A winner!"
593,"I've been to the Sinful Kitchen twice now for Saturday morning brunch.  It is close to my house, even walkable, and I am always looking for solid brunch alternatives outside of downtown.
The Good:  
The waitstaff is kind and gentle
There is parking
The Great:
They might make the best home fries in town (twice cooked, expertly spiced)
Their $4 Mimosa is well made and generous
The Meh:
The poached eggs on my Benedict had hard yolks (full disclosure, the super nice waitress offered to get me new eggs, I declined.  I had already started eating and it was too late to start all over again)
There was an odd moment when a chef, covered in food stains, walked through the restaurant with a confused look on his face
I might agree with other reviewers that the price tag is high.  The food quality is good, but I am not sure if the price point is comparable to some of other solid brunch joints out in this part of town, like the Frog in Westbrook.
Overall, I have high hopes for the SK and hope they continue to evolve.  They would be worth a stop for a  Mimosa/home fry combination any day!"
594,"This is a cozy breakfast place, the servers are quick and attentive. The food was delicious we will definitely be eating here again!"
595,Way overrated. Burnt potatoes and over cooked eggs. See the other posted photos. Pleasant wait staff and good service.
596,"Stepping foot into this place is really like walking into someone's home but it is completely converted to a quaint little restaurant serving amazing brunch. 

Days of operation are Wednesday-Sunday 8am-2pm. 

The reviews had me driving to check this spot out but more so for the ghost pepper sausage that everyone was raving about to try out. That packs some heat and a good kick.  To top that off had to enjoy the stuffed French toast which the special filling for the day was a blueberry almond cream cheese. Top that off with real maple syrup (which is an additional $2 by the way) and all is good. Can't forget the home frites-- amazing!! Crunchy, pillowy and full of flavor. Could not get enough. But NO! Sunday brunch calls for a fresh made apple cider mimosa rimmed with cinnamon sugar. Taste of fall.  A lovely full meal that rounded out the rest of my day.

There is something for someone even those who are gluten intolerant. Simply ask. Customer service is very attentive and personable. Come through and give it a try. It maybe sinful but well worth it."
597,What a delight to enjoy a wonderful Sunday Brunch @ The Sinful Kitchen.  Very enjoyable entrees and friendly staff.  We will return!
598,"Understated elegance! I called to check the wait they said 35 mins, I requested to add my name to list as I had to drive over and they said of course without hesitation.  The wait was much faster than anticipated about twenty mins, not bad for 11:15 on a Sunday.  We were pleasantly greeted with waters! Iced coffee was good, they have coconut milk upon request! Two people had the rancheros and both said they were cooked well, and tasted great.  One person has a Benedict, it was gone before I even had the opportunity to look at it, so I'd say that's a hit. I got the peanut butter cup waffle and it made my taste buds scream!!!  Flavorful, beautiful, sweet, creamy, heaven.  They let me substitute eggs for meat and the home fries were a little gift from God.  Waitress offered refills and suggestions!   I will go back for sure!  So thankful I brought my out of town guests here for there last meal on their way out of town."
599,The food was excellent. The red blanket hash was to die for. The pouched eggs were slightly over cooked and more baked than pouched. The service was good too. A bit overpriced 14.50 for hash and two eggs.
600,"Food was excellent, but more than that the service was above and beyond. We dined with our two year old son and were greeted with toy cars and a coloring book to keep him entertained throughout the meal.  Upon leaving the manager told him he could pick a car to take with him, which he talked about all the way home. Will definitely dine here again and would recommend to anyone with children."
601,"The Front Room is tucked inside the bottom floor of an actual house. Blink when driving by and you will miss it. We came in for dinner with a party of six and had no reservation, but were able to be seated right away. 
The vibe inside is casual and cozy. The kitchen is open, so you can see the food being made. The service was here and there, but still friendly and decent. 
Menu wise, The Front Room had a huge variety from meatloaf to seafood. For starters we had brussels with toasted almond and honey goat cheese as well as a arugula and beet salad. Both of these dishes were packed with flavor and large enough portions to split with everyone. The beet salad was my favorite of the two. 

For entrees my group had Casco Bay Scallops, roast 1/2 chicken, short rib and meatloaf. Despite being a larger group, the food came out very quickly. I was surprised by how huge the portions were, so come hungry!
My scallops were perfection and from the bites I tried of everyone else's entree there was nothing disappointing. 
The only downfall of this place was that it is a tiny room and gets very loud inside when you combine everyone talking, and the kitchen sounds. As a bigger group we really couldn't hold down conversation with people down the table and especially with my hard of hearing older family. I would come here again with just one other person, but not with a group due to the noise level."
602,"My photos don't do this place justice, but the food was awesome. We walked in around 9:30 and was seated right away. Ordered two coffees, eggs benny special with spinach and caramelized onions, and the huevos rancheros with eggs over easy. Oh man, it was so good. The huevos were the best. But everything was tasty. If we lived here, I'd come all the time!"
603,"Awesome, unique menu. Delicious food. I'd absolutely go back the next time we're in Portland! They have high chairs, but they do not have a kids menu; however, you can order half-portions if some meals!"
604,"Looking for a hearty brunch in Portland this weekend, we ended up at The Front Room. For a Saturday around 11 am we were expecting a wait and were right. They said 45 minutes to an hour for a table for two. Lucky for us, bar was first come first serve and we scored two seats within less than ten minutes of waiting. 

This restaurant seems pretty unorganized. They only had one bartender for brunch on a Saturday and no bar backs. This guy was fulfilling every drink ticket, going to their storage (he kept having to go outside) to get more champagne, and serve all the bar patrons. Safe to say, not at the fault of the bartender, we weren't acknowledged for a good ten minutes until after we sat because of how busy he was. We placed our order. Our beers were very warm which was disappointing for an 8 dollar beer but at least it was poured right away. 

Unfortunately, it took over an hour from when we placed our order for it to come to us. We didnt asked where it was but other people around us were having a similar situation and when they'd ask where their food was the bartenders response was ""we are busy"". Poor planning to not execute quicker knowing you'll be crowded at brunch time. The food itself was great. I really enjoyed my sweet potato hash and biscuits with raspberry jam. My fianc√© got a bacon egg and cheese on toast. He liked it but we were shocked that a sandwich that can't take more than 3 minutes to make took over an hour to come out. 

When we were leaving we noticed they had put a sign outside with the specials of the day which sounded great but our bartender never mentioned the specials to us. Definitely a bummer. 

Although the food was good, we probably will not be coming back here because of the lack of service and wait."
605,"Went for a weekday brunch.  First of all, the food isn't anything special.  I had French toast and it was not great.  Really? Anyone could make it.  The coffee wasn't too good either.  The worst part was the service.  There's not many servers, the bar tender didn't even acknowledge me (I was at the bar and he was busy stocking shelves) and the busser was slammed.  So really there's no reason to come here."
606,"This place is worth the wait. We went on a Saturday morning around 10:30 and had to wait about 15-20 minutes. The restaurant is about a couple blocks from some great water views so you can take a quick walk while you wait.

The food and service was outstanding. I got the Vegetable Hash with biscuits and was surely not disappointed. Food came out quick and the waitress was knowledgeable regarding the menu. They fill up your coffee fairly quick as well! If you're in Portland I would make an effort to go here."
607,"This is probably one of the best places I've ate at in Portland. My husband and I spent the weekend in Portland for my birthday. We went to The Front Room for dinner Saturday night and I had my heart set on creme br√ªl√©e, which we found out they were out of. Our meal was so absolutely amazing, that we went back early before our departure and enjoyed brunch topped off with some creme br√ªl√©e. All was fantastic including our service."
608,"Came here with my family for brunch last Saturday before our kayaking reservation. We were told to come here by a local that we met at the farmer's market earlier that morning. 

We were absolutely starving by the time we got there and we were not disappointed! We didn't have a reservation but were seated almost immediately and the service was fast. We had the egg plate (2 eggs any way, home fries, toast, and either sausage or bacon), veggie gnocchi, corned beef hash, mac & cheese, and the sweet potato hash. The best dish was the corned beef hash - it looked like real roast beef that had been torn up, which is something that I have never seen before, and it had tons of flavor. The sweet potato hash was pretty good as well, but the egg wasn't poached properly and the yolk was not runny, which was slightly disappointing. 

Was a great and filling brunch option for a good price. (Also- make sure you ask for jam with your toast! It is amazing). 

*Note: this restaurant only serves brunch / lunch. It closes in the late afternoon every day."
609,"Spectacular short rib. We started with the drink of the day, a gin and cucumber and blueberry concoction and the man on the town cocktail. Both were delicious but I found the drink special overly cucumbery. Their house made focaccia is excellent but I'd prefer the olive oil with a little herbs or red pepper flakes. The Tomato soup had a nice freshness to it and the cheese on top added an unctuous flavor. The blt was average with excellent bacon. Their short rib with horseradish potatoes was sublime though. Succulent and soft short rib paired with a unique take on the traditional mashed potatoes. Their negroni for two was fun and came in a lightbulb but I was expecting something a little more than that since the drink in the lightbulb isn't so unusual and the drink was on the sweeter side. Out table had a wobble to it as well but the staff was very accommodating and really tried to fix it. Overall I'll definitely be back."
610,"I would fly to Portland just to eat at the Front Room again. We tried to come here for brunch on Saturday, but it was packed. Instead we came for dinner at 5pm, as soon as they open, and even then were shown to a table and told we need to vacate that by 6:15pm. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. For an appetizer I convinced my friend we needed to try the short rib gravy poutine, and - whoa - that was absolutely amazing. So flavorful, and the polenta is a nice change from fries. For my entree I chose the scallop dish, and the scallops were the sweetest and most tender I've ever had the pleasure of eating - plus the price was right, too! Overall, one of the best meals I have eaten this year."
611,"One of the best kept secrets in Portland for breakfast! Absolutely outstanding cuisine. I had the steak and eggs, and it completely hit the spot while it was snowing out. This place is family friendly, and adheres to all your breakfast needs."
612,"We were told the wait would be around 45 minutes on a Sunday morning for brunch. Completely understandable so we went for a quick walk and we're back in 25 so we wouldn't miss our call. We came back and waited another 20 and my companion very politely checked to see if we missed the call. The seating host proceeded to yell at my companion that we had been called ""several times"". We had been willing to wait until my companion told me how she had been treated. We went somewhere else. Not cool, Front Room. Might be time for some employee customer service training."
613,"Considering making the 10-plus hour drive to Portland--and devoting half of my take-home pay--to eat brunch here every day.

Had the Caprese Benedict, and it was superb."
614,This is actually my favorite restaurant in Portland. It's probably not what most would classify as fine dining but it's never let me down. The food is always good and the service is always friendly. It's one of the few places in Portland that I feel has great value for what you get plus it's a cozy little place.
615,"We arrived for a late lunch after exploring the East Promenade, and it was still very full, so we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table. By the time we sat down to eat, the restaurant was probably only about 1/3rd full. And it became apparent that the servers were more interested in closing up shop in a timely manner than actually tending to their patrons. This was just a small hiccup, though. Ours was friendly enough, just inattentive.

The food was thankfully excellent. We ordered the Mac 'n' Cheese and the Croque Madame, and both were delicious. I loved the hot dogs in the Mac 'n' Cheese - made it feel rather homey. 

If you happen to be in East Promenade, then definitely consider making a stop here when you get hungry."
616,"- the kitchen is open in such a way that is able to be seen from the dinning room, which is cool, but also very noisy.
- the food and drinks are a bit pricey.
- there's not a lot of street parking options.
- it always seems too busy in there and there doesn't seem to be a lot of room for how many customers they always get.
- the food is tasty.
- nice atmosphere."
617,I love this place as you can see from my last review. But it really irks me that with all the families (currently) 3 in here as I write this. There's no kids options. Makes no sense. I wonder how many awesome families don't come back because the a la carte adds almost up to but cheaper than a full adult menu.
618,Fantastic place for brunch.  What a nice vibe and great food.  Lynette was so nice as our hostess.  She actually cares about your experience here.  Can't wait to come back.
619,Have been here a couple times for breakfast and everything has been good so far.  Would recommend if you are looking for a casual place to have breakfast with good food.
620,examine your check very carefully for food and drinks items you did not order - if you attempt to receive credit after the fact / good luck- promised refunds do not arrive as promised-
621,"I've been here for brunch on each of my last 4 visits to Portland, and it's very solid!  We love sitting on the quiet patio out front with our dog.

Biscuits and gravy are rich and delicious, but don't leave me feeling too full. I love that you can order this as a side instead of the whole meal.

They do a great hash, and often have very inventive specials. The gnocchi Benedict (on the everyday menu) is something you won't see too many other places, and it comes loaded with cubes bacon or pancetta. Highly recommend trying it.

Can't endorse with a full 5 stars because of one small hiccup that could have been handled better.  The most recent visit we did have an issue where we both ordered poached eggs, and all 4 egg yolks were completely cooked through.  The server apologized and replaced them with new eggs, but didn't offer to replace the full dish (so it was room temperature by the time the new eggs were ready). To be honest we probably would have said to just bring the new eggs anyways because there was nothing wrong with the rest of the dish and I don't like to waste, but either way I think a 5 Star spot would have at least offered to replace the full dish or comp something small on the bill.  

Also - bring back the red flannel hash!"
622,"Great food. Great service!
Came in on a Monday morning and it was pretty busy. We were served very fast and with a smile.
All the bread is homemade and the focaccia was to die for."
623,Food and breakfast cocktails were delicious. Food took a while to arrive but still deserves five stars due to attentiveness of staff and quality of meal.
624,"If you enjoy great food, this is a great spot! If you don't enjoy terrible service and ticks being smooshed in front of you - plenty of better places in town.

I've been coming here for almost 5 years and typically always get great food and decent service. My most recent visits have just not been anywhere near what they used to be. The past couple of times have been pretty inconsistent for both food and service, but a recent visit just ended any sort of joy I used to have coming here.

I arrived here on a Saturday morning for brunch with my girlfriend and we were quickly seated by the super nice host next to the hosting booth. It was a little more busy than the rest of the place but still a good spot. When our server came over, that was when we first noticed things weren't the same as past visits. She was very short with us, very rude and didn't even mention the specials until we asked (the special hash they had that day was phenomenal). We ordered our drinks and received everything in good time. 

It all fell apart when we asked for jam - I had asked for jam since we both ordered toast and she promptly left to get it before my girlfriend could finish also asking for jam. When she came back we attempted to ask for refills and ketchup, but the second we asked for ketchup she was already walking away (she did toss it on the table before ignoring another request for jam). Thankfully he host was great and refilled our drinks. 

Right in the middle of our meal we saw a couple come in w their dog and asking to be seated outside. What happened after was just disgusting. She had found a tick on her dog and instead of goi outside decided to crush it right next to our meal. With the host right next to her, we couldn't believe she too didn't say something! 

At that point we both lost appetite and when the server came back, she didn't even ask us for a box. 

She just took our plates and threw everything out! 

Needless to say, we're no longer going to be frequenting this place. It's too bad because we love the other 'Room' locations so having to cross this place off our list is extremely disappointing."
625,"Oh front room. Pricy as hell but good as hell. 

Best service on the hill, best eggs in town. Open your wallet and open your heart for the only redeemable ""Room.""
Small and bustling, and worth the wait. Fingers crossed for the outdoor seating option. Enjoy each DEVILISHLY GOOD bite."
626,"you know all the food is amazing when the special is the first and best eggs benedict you've had in eggsitence (get it). yeah the wait might have been long, but it's worth every minute to hour. we both got the eggs benedict special, which had local tomatoes, goat cheese, and hollandaise on em. that hollandaise sauce is to die for also got bacon on the side which ventured it's way on top. they kill brunch, and ya gotta have it!"
627,"What a wonderful find in Munjoy Hill!  My Husband and I were staying in the area for the weekend and our hosts highly recommend The Front Room and now we see why.  We ate here twice in one day, once for breakfast and then returned for dinner.  For breakfast I had the lamb Eggs Benedict special which was so tasty and my Husband got the corned beef hash, which was one of the best he's ever had!!!

We returned for dinner and had a feast!  We started with the deviled eggs of the day which featured pulled pork and cole slaw, oh so good!  We also had the fried green tomatoes, which were also delicious.

For dinner my Husband got the Lamb Sephardi Pie which was phenomenally delicious!  I highly recommend this dish!!  I had a special- the Olive oil poached halibut with rice, which was also very good.   The fish was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  

The service was also very good on both occasions.  Friendly, courteous and promp!  Our dinner server was especially friendly, funny and attentive.  We will for sure be back here next time we are in Portland!!"
628,"Great food and service.  1st time, recommended by friend.  Definitely would return and recommend  myself.  Ask for Lynette,  great server...."
629,"The food - 
Pros: Awesome hash, nice big chunks of corned beef.
Cons: no black tea, no skim milk, no berries for the oatmeal, most dishes contain garlic.
The atmosphere:
Very tight, too many tables smooshed in, makes it hard on waitstaff and customers."
630,Consistently good! Nice brunch selection and cocktails. Favorite is the potato gnocchi and homemade corned beef hash!
631,"The dude who owns this restaurant and several others on the peninsula is someone whose ego impacted the quality of his dominion.  I used to love The Front Room when it first opened. However, I went back for dinner this weekend and was so disappointed.   Now the venue has a slick, corporate feel.  The staff are saccharine.  This place has lost its panache; so sad. Our meals were okay, just okay.  No point talking about what we ate except to say that portions were skimpy and frankly unremarkable.  No plans on going back. Why?  Because Portland is a ""foodie"" town; there are far more extraordinary restaurants to patronize.  I wish restaurateurs could understand the laws of diminishing returns."
632,"My partner and I drove by on a Saturday and saw the wait didn't appear to be too bad so we stopped in for brunch. We were told a 15 minute wait for a two top. It turned into a 40 minute wait, during which we saw multiple tables arrive after us and be seated before us.

It was clear they were understaffed but the hostess did a fantastic job of trying to keep the plates spinning. Tables were left uncleared for long periods of time as the servers did not clear their tables.

Once seated, however service was great! My croque madame was divine! My partner got that hash special and very much enjoyed it. I was looking forward to that chocolate cheesecake that was on the board but was told they were out.

Good food, ok service, would try again at a less busy time."
633,Really cute breakfast place. My husband and I shared the three omelets with avocado and spinach. It was delicious. The hot chocolate was sooo good! The staff and service were very welcoming.
634,"Such a disappointment-service was rude and the food was mediocre, at best.  Our sweet potato hash was swimming in the water from the poached eggs. And hash, it was not.  It was diced sweet potato which were boiled with a few diced poblano - there wasn't a piece of char on the entire dish. And the English muffin was barely toasted - it was essentially raw. With so many great restaurants in Portland, I certainly won't see the need to return here."
635,"If I lived in Portland I would go for broke with this place around. I got the special which was an eggs Benedict with tomato and goat cheese. I am a bit of a benny snob but the eggs were perfectly poached and let's just say I would drive 8 hours for the hollandaise alone. Go here, please."
636,"If you can find parking, this place is worth it!  Great breakfast!  I had the Ham & Swiss Omelet with Roasted Breakfast Potatoes and it hit the spot."
637,We had breakfast here this morning and it was great! Had a lovely time and the waitress was super nice. Would definitely recommend! Nothing crazy about it that stood out specifically but was a nice breakfast place.
638,"This is a neighborhood staple on Munjoy Hill that offers a mix of high end American comfort food and cocktails. I'd recommend going for brunch as their menu is more interesting than their dinner menu. The servers are great while the hostesses can sometimes come across as brusk. The food is always creative, delicious and appealing. The last visit I enjoyed an autumn vegetable hash with pumpkin bread that was one of the better meals I've had out in awhile. My husband really enjoyed the eggs Benedict as well. The Bloody Mary I had was average, but the mimosa I tried that my friend had was on point.  If you are going to events at the St Lawrence Arts Center, this is your most convenient dining option. We'd go back again."
639,"After seeing such good reviews of this place on yelp and the long line to get in on a Sunday morning, my friend and I decided to give it a try. The Front Room is close to the East end of Portland, close to our Airbnb. We waited around 45 minutes before getting a seat outside.

The waitress was very friendly and let us know the specials right away. I already knew I wanted to try the vegetarian gnocchi after all the rave about it on yelp. My friend got the special open sandwich of the day. And we both shared a grilled cantaloupe bread.

My vegetarian gnocchi was just okay. It tasted really bland. It had potato gnocchi mixed with spinach and mushroom. On top of that there were two pouched eggs with hollandaise sauce. 

My friend's open sandwich had tomato, arugula, cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. It was good, but nothing too special. 

My favorite out of everything we ordered was the grilled cantaloupe bread. It was sweet and buttery! Definitely recommend their grilled sweet breads!

Overall I thought the food was okay. If I were to be back again, I would probably just do coffee and a grilled bread so I can slathered butter all over it!"
640,"The food here was absolutely amazing. We came for breakfast and each got a soup (French onion and blueberry), I got the eggs Benedict and my husband got the breakfast sandwich. Every bite was amazing. The only hiccup was we ordered the bread of the day and never got it. We weren't charged for it, so no harm, no foul."
641,"The best breakfast by far!! In town with friends for a half marathon and was walking distance to this gem!!! If I could give 10 starts I would! Great food, great service great company! Thank  You!!!"
642,A solid brunch option. This small place packs a hearty menu. Lots of poached egg choices along with the usual fare. Uncomplicated hearty dishes with a surprising array of mimosa flavors. All the dishes I saw served looked delicious. There was a continuous line while I was there but seating at the bar is first come first served.
643,"I have been here probably 50 times.

3.5 stars leaning up.

I wrote them a review once; 5-star rating.  And I really blew them up...  said that it was all that.

Really lit them up; went above and beyond and i got overzealous with my review comparing to NYC, SF, NOLA...  which WAS quite overzealous.

Then I had several not so hot experiences, and downgraded my review and ultimately removed my review due to confusion and frustration.

If this review can be useful in any way I would state the following:
______________________________________________
Fabulous place for Brunch.  They do a bang up job.
______________________________________________
End of review.

I have never been disappointed at brunch.  EverythAng for brunch has been spot on.

Dinners are a different story.

I have had some meals, where they've knocked it out of the park.  The bluefin tuna special comes to memory (approximately 2-years ago)...  it was so good I still remember it.

The eggplant parm - also very good... solid choice.

And I have had multiple, multiple meals where I walked away disappointed...  Just didn't know what the chefs were thinking that night but completely missed it.

So to end my long drawn out story.

Brunch = GTG

Dinner = be cautious.  You may be disappointed.

The overall consistent excellent brunch meals skews the review to the level that it is at.

Thank you; and have a nice day."
644,"What a great neighborhood bar and restaurant! Everyone knew everyone - except me, I was from out of town but I felt welcomed! Gourmet food! Whipped goat cheese toast was amazing. Easy to miss because it looks like a house on the corner - and small - worth the wait and good food, reasonably priced! Loved it! The kind of place you want to own and work!"
645,I had the short rib and it was a religious experience! Absolutely amazing food and the service was fabulous! I can't recommend The Front Room enough.
646,"The eggs were over cooked, the hash which I've had before was very dry and my toast was burned.  The place was packed which isn't unusual but I was very disappointed in the whole experience."
647,"Perfect balance between fancy and casual dining! Whether you want to impress someone with a meal and a cocktail or just looking for a quick bite at the bar, this place is a go-to! Their meal choices are so unique while appropriately priced and always delicious! I recently moved to the East End, and was ecstatic when I learned I could practically see my place from the bar. Definitely a go-to for me. Friendly staff and fast paced, highly recommend!"
648,"This place has amazing breakfast, great staff and amazing breakfast some more. Get there around 9:30 for little to no wait, and a spicy bloody Mary always makes waiting better."
649,"Delicious food, friendly service, cute locale. What more could you ask for?

Came on a weekend for brunch with a big party and the hostess immediately started figuring out how she could fit us in so we could all sit together, rather than having us split up into two separate tables. She apologized multiple times for the wait, even though we were the ones inconveniencing her.

Our server was attentive and helpful, and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the roasted Brussels sprouts with whipped goat cheese and it was fantastic. The sprouts had a sweet, caramelized flavor and the goat cheese was the perfect complement in both taste and texture.  Other friends raved about the sweet potato hash and the eggs in a boat.

Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Portland!"
650,"After a year of walking past the establishment or only managing a drink because it was always so busy, I was finally able to gather the patience to wait. There was no need, we found a seat immediately, on a Sunday! welcomed surprise! Our service, awesome. 
*cue negative nancy* The place gets smoky. Theory: small place, many customers, lots of cooking. The smoke isn't suffocating, but definitely makes for a hot experience. Is it the best brunch in Portland? Well.... it's definitely homely food. As for the quality and flavors, rather wanting.

I felt like I had hit a tourist hotspot click-bait rather than a true Portland brunch destination. I'd go back but only for happy hour drinks or cocktails."
651,"Had an all-around great experience! From the accommodating Aussie hostess(sorry, I did not get your name!) To our great server, Josh to the incredible meal.  Only negative was the loud atmosphere.  Worth the 15 minute wait at the bar, which wasnt bad for a Saturday night."
652,"Gone way downhill.

I've had breakfast here with a friend twice in the past month, and I won't be returning. The omelet was greasy spoon quality, overcooked and caramel burnt, and the heartburn it caused was still with me later in the morning. My friend's oatmeal was lukewarm. This wasn't because the kitchen was too busy, since there were less than half a dozen other tables occupied. 

On a previous visit, I ordered the biscuits, which used to be a pleasure. These weren't. They were sodden lumps of dough which were close to inedible. 

This used to be such a comfortable place to get a reasonably priced good breakfast. Not any more, I'm very sorry to have to say."
653,"Never been to Portland before and a friend recommended this restaurant. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food, food was expertly prepared, and the atmosphere was great. View to the open kitchen. Very small restaurant so go early. Our waitress recommended the beet salad and it was really good. The special that night was haddock and it was fantastic. Blueberry pie for dessert. YUM. will go back if ever here again!"
654,"The hostess was quite challenged by the organization of the room and the numbers she had to crunch.  We were told 30-45 minutes until seating and it was 90 minutes before we were offered a table.  This is after several parties of 4 that had just walked in were seated, we were a party of 3. We ended up having to wait for someone at the bar to leave until we could dine and then one of our party had to stand and eat. 

While the Duck Confit Eggs Benedict and Corn Beef hash were outstanding, the Bloody Mary's and the flavored Mimosa's were not."
655,"Very nice place for breakfast or brunch. Clean, comfortable atmosphere. Food was great and was presented nicely. Home fries were great. Overall, would definitely go here again."
656,"I am definitely a fan.  I had not tried this place because I hated one of his other restaurants, but some friends wanted to come here, and I loved it.  It is a warm and cozy neighborhood spot, and the food was creative and delicious.  I was debating among three things, and the waiter said to go with the roasted Brussels sprouts.  It seemed a little weird to have a main course of Brussels sprouts, but hey, it's really no different than having a salad as a main course.  They were extraordinary.  The Brussels sprouts were roasted perfectly, and the whipped goat cheese, vinaigrette and nuts went with them beautifully.  I would get this dish again.  I would love if they would do a half order as a side so I could try something else as well.  My friend raved about his real corned beef hash."
657,Food is good but it's no secret that this place is NOT friendly to people of color. Staff and diners alike will plague you with their micro-aggressive behavior and the patronizing way that they meddle into your personal conversations.
658,"This was our second time here. We put in our names and the hostess said 30-45 min. Come 45 min I went to ask where we were in line and she said oh I called your name. I said ummm I didn't hear you do that... there were 2 open tables but she wouldn't seat us: said we need to wait for someone to get up. She said ok sorry I probably didn't say your name loud enough!? Really????? Anyway at 1 hour wait we were seated. 

These two people walked in behind us and were seated before us at the bar. I couldn't believe the shitty service. Nothing was offered- no free drink for waiting or a credit off the bill... nothing. Waiter was nice thats why it gets 2 stars. 


My food was SO BLAND. The blandest food I've had in a very long time! I was VERY disappointed. And it is my boy friend's birthday breakfast meal. Horrible.  Visiting Portland out of town so that sucked. His meal was good so another reason why it's 2 stars instead of 1."
659,"Solid brunch menu. But, really, it's all about the CHEESECAKE, here. It is so good, and they make it in house. 

Service was okay. I will say that I was disappointed when a friend asked inquired about a vegan option and the waiter. lankly said ""no"" amd didn't offer any other options or even attempt to accomodate/empathize with her. Boo on that!"
660,"We came here for brunch on a nice sunny day. We got to sit outside and enjoy some nice cool cocktails! I was particularly impressed by their mimosa selection (pomegranate, mango, blood orange, and regular).  I had the eggs on a boat (2 poached eggs with butternut squash, spinach and goat cheese over a brioche toast with home fries). It was either that or the sweet potato hash but I decided to try the eggs on a boat. 

The first few bites were so delicious but after some time, I wanted some spice in my dish, something to kick up the flavors, just because they are all so sweet. 

Overall, I had a great experience and our server was charming, with a great attitude. I am most definitely coming back!!"
661,"Great spot for dinner, small and quiet but not to the point where it's cramped or seems silent. Excellent specials, if there are any that sound good I would recommend spending the extra couple dollars to get it. Have either ordered or had a taste of the chicken, steak, prime rib, and pork chop. Just like all the other ""Room's"", all the food was delicious and will definitely be coming back!"
662,I admit to loving the Front Room.   The service is attentive without being intrusive.  The food is very good without being ostentatious.  We get to the Front Room almost every time we are in Portland and are not disappointed.
663,"Absolutely atrocious customer service from the hostess on two separate occasions. It's sad that this woman goes out of her way to be overtly rude to potential customers. Considering how many incredible restaurants are in Portland, it's not a wise business decision. After our last experience, we walked right down the street and received a warm welcome (and incredible meal) at Blue Spoon. It bothers me to write a review like this but what we witnessed was both embarrassing and insulting."
664,"That. Brunch.

Stop looking at other places. This is where you should be. Who cares how long the wait is. It's just as long everywhere else. Stop trying to find a faster place, it's worth every minute of your wait for this brunch.

Get the potato gnocci. It's not really gnocci. It's mostly just potatoes underneath spinach, thick cut bacon and some gooey eggs that will make you feel like you're eating something healthy even though it's mostly bacon and friend potatoes.

But who cares? It's brunch. And it will be one of the best brunches you've ever had."
665,"I don't know how things are on weekends, but a Friday morning brunch at The Front Room was calm and kid-full, as most of the handful plus parties dining in at the same time as us had a child among them.

We scored a parking spot right by the patio they had set up along the sidewalk of their corner real estate.  Inside there are 16 tables - two of which are booths, 3 4-tops, the remainder being 2 seaters, along with 10 stools at the bar.

For our three appetites, we were pretty well satisfied with two entrees and a side.

POTATO GNOCCHI* || 10 spinach, bacon, two poached eggs, and hollandaise
This was terrific with nice soft gnocci and flavorful spinach and bacon.

GRILLED DUCK & GOAT CHEESE with sweet onion jam on house-made brioche || 13
We had them cut this in 3 for us instead of the normal  halves, which was not very evenly done, but we made do.  The sandwich was well filled and tasty.

CORNED BEEF HASH || 12
The portion seemed small for its double digit price tag, but it was the chunky sort, which I prefer, and quite good with its crispy edges.

With full and happy tummies, we were good to go!"
666,"Extremely friendly hostess and waitress. Unbelievably delicious food. 

We had the vegetarian pinto bean soup, French onion soup, the duck leg and the Sheppard's pie. 

Soups were kind of a miss. bean soup was ok, not great, and the French onion had too much of a (sherry?) flavor. 

Lamb Sheppard's pie was OUT OF THIS WORLD good. Ham, back, cheese curds in the mashed potatoes. Perfectly cooked veggies, and tasty gravy made this so good. 

Duck leg with red flannel hash was almost as good as the Sheppard's pie. Perfectly cooked crispy duck leg with an on top. The yolk mixed with with everything is ectasy."
667,"Got the two eggs meal and it was AMAZING!!! And for only $10, this place is upscale and definitely worth its price"
668,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. My meal was delicious. I had an eggs Benedict with a side of the grilled breakfast bread (orange vanilla poppyseed). My husband had the baked potato special with poached eggs. He enjoyed it but wished the potatoes had had some seasoning, even a little salt. I would absolutely come back but may take my husband a bit more convincing. And folks who said the smell in here was bad - we did not notice this at all. For what it's worth."
669,"If it's a Sunday morning and you are hangry, turn back now. I repeat, turn back now. 

However, if you  stare into the eyes of the hostess, and you have even the slightest sense of compassion,  you will realize that your hunger pains aren't the end of the world; the hostsess has it worse than you.  As my stomach growled and i thought about which girl from the annoying bridal party I would eat if we had to turn to cannibalism, I realized I would rather chew off my own hand. Alas, my boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year anniversary,  so I needed my hands for later.  Hands are totally underrated. Or maybe mouths are overrated.... I digress. 

Anyway, if you find yourself waiting an extensive period of time to be seated: just stare at the hostess. She is holding back a mental breakdown, and she is suffering an entire shift of hangry sons of bitches. Is she doing a great job? Eh, I don't know that she's doing a great job at her actual job (she told us the wait was a half hour, and we came back in 15 minutes only to find we were scratched off the list. She also busses tables at the speed of a large tortoise )...but she's definitely doing a good job of not screaming, crying, or joining in on Portland's heroin epidemic. For that, I applaud her. 

Now, food? You will wait for this too. I figured we were just waiting on the chickens to lay the eggs. And maybe the chickens are free range and so we were waiting for the eggs PLUS the finding of the eggs. Fortunately,  the waiter was so stoned that it made the waiting  period completely worth it. I envision that maybe he even got the chickens stoned because time was not of the essence.  Patience Is a virtue, though,  so one could call this a virtuous breakfast. It depends on how full of s*** you are as a person. I don't judge. 

My man lover had the huevos rancheros. He said they were good, but far from traditional (but he could have been talking about me. I was too hungry to think straight).  I had the corned beef hash, and i would comment on it similarly.  I almost went with the gnocchi but I'm anti- hollandaise because I don't like when big loads are just dumped on my eggs. The hangry older woman sitting at the adjacent table ordered them, but I could tell by looking at her husband that the breakfast load was the preferable load option. 

Mimosas were a nice touch to the meal. Kind of livened things up for us and gave us energy for the day. Plus,  I was still getting over the fact that my heartthrob's omission  about having a golden retriever. That's the kind of thing you need alcohol to recover from.

Overall: good food, but tough on organization and service during an understandably busy brunch rush."
670,"This was our first meal in Maine and I would definitely come back. First off, service was amazing. Our server made us feel super welcome. We started off with the griddle bread and today that was the chocolate strawberry bread. It was absolutely delicious. Super chocolatey and had strawberry pieces in it. We shared the steak and eggs and the hollandaise egg Benedict. Steak was seasoned amazingly and was served with home fries. The hollandaise was the best I ever had. It was cheesy, gooey goodness. If you are in Maine you should definitely stop here for brunch."
671,"We went for breakfast one day while in Portland.  It was outstanding.  The restaurant is small and has great d√©cor.  The food was great and the portions were generous.  It is in a part of town we hadn't visited before, so it was an adventure that we will likely repeat when next in Portland!"
672,"YASSSSSSSS this is the brunch heaven type of place. Long line though. 
We got lucky and sat at the bar. The bartender, I think his name was Ryan was amazing. I had a blood orange mimosa and my husband got an iced cappuccino with rum and cream liquor. LEGIT!! 
Food was great. Definitely recommend the rueben!!!"
673,"My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartendar gave us great recommendations. I tried the potato gnocci, which is one of their signature items. We also tried the mimosas (they have about 5 different types). 10/10 would recommend both of these items to anyone trying this place out for the first time!"
674,"Affordable and delicious breakfast, although a little ways from the heart of downtown (took an Uber $5). Had veggie gnocchi & eggs in a boat. Good service. Fairly quiet at 9am. Would go back. Asked for egg whites, got full eggs...didn't send back."
675,"NOTE: This review is ONLY for brunch.

When you tell people where you're going to get brunch and they all tell you the same thing, ""get ready to smell,"" you know something's up. Even as I met my brekkie date, the very first thing he mentioned after greeting me was, ""So the ventilation in this place..."" I cut him off. I had heard. And after waiting for him for only five or so minutes, I could already tell food smell was seeping into my clothing and hair. I understand the older building wasn't necessarily meant to house the restaurant, but... Open a window! Light some candles! Do something!

Now let's talk 'bout the pertinents and such of this place at brunch.

Service
The server had an incredibly friendly disposition... when we saw her. She did the absolute minimum for service that she could - took our order (food and drinks at the same time), slid drinks onto our table without a word as she was passing by, dropped the food off without a word, dropped the check off and wished us a ""very fabulous day"". She never checked on us once, and it wasn't even that busy. When our drinks had sat empty for twenty or so minutes, we finally caught her attention and asked for more water. When I look back on my first time here the word ""parched"" will be one of the first to come to mind.

Food
1. Veggie gnocchi
Ugh. I wanted this to be amazing, and it fell short. To begin with, the whole thing was wet (there was a noticeable amount of liquid swishing on my plate), the poached eggs were overdone (as in - they were lsoft-boiled), and the gnocchi were positively enormous (the size of clementines, and they were both dense and a bit flavorless). I still enjoyed it... I just wouldn't get it again. Or crave it. Or recommend it. Here's hoping it was just an off day!

2. Special morning breakfast bread
I had no idea this was even a thing. My brekkie pal asked if I wanted some of the special morning bread (I don't even think this is what it's called, but we're going with it for now as I can't find it on the menu). Today's option was chocolate strawberry. THIS was the highlight of my brunch. THIS is something I would go back for. Grilled and slathered in butter (I also specially requested a side of strawberry jam because it really brought the whole thing together), it was one of the chocolatiest things I have ever eaten EVER. And, y'know what?, that's totally okay with me! It was just lovely with my perfectly brewed iced coffee. So, if you come here for bunch - get the special morning breakfast bread WHATEVER it may be... you will not be disappointed.

3. Homefries
While I wanted them, I didn't have the home fries. My dining cohort suggested they were not the best in town and as such we didn't order them. Segue...

4. The bowl of fruit
I didn't want any fruit until I saw the table next to me get some. A heaping bowl full of beautiful, colorful melons, berries, and grapes. For only $4? THIS is a bargain!

I believe the outdoor seating, specialty mimosa (today's was mango - SO wish I had gotten one), and breakfast bread is definitely where it's at here. This is a quality brunch spot and I definitely recommend checking it out at least once. Just, maybe, don't order the veggie gnocchi or wear your Sunday finest!"
676,"Brunch in Portland? You must - MUST! - get a table here. The crowds forming outside awaiting entire parties, or a coveted four-top to open up already know this. Hence, the crowds. Hence, herewithin thus.

The corned beef hash won on all fronts. So well cured, with big hunks of fire-roasted peppers, onions reduced to jam and the right amount of herbed potatoes, you're gonna want this mambajamba with a biscuits, and a $2 side of fennel-heavy sausage gravy. Hot damn, friends, you have done et well. 

Stole a bite of her brioche French toast, so if sweet's your brunch bag, go in on that piece - just the right sugarin' and the texture of the day-old brioche turned brekkie is spot on fantastic. Speaking of sweet, our server couldn't have been more accomodating, ready with an answer or a refill, even in a packed room.

The only dim spot was the sip of a loose, watery Bloody Mary. It had the heat proper from the house-infused jalape√±o vodka, but the mix left a bit to be desired. Hell, even the Venus de Milo is missing a few limbs - doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece.

Which is what The Front Room's brunch proved to be."
677,"The food tastes great but the portion to price ratio is off. 
My order. 
Two orders of Sweet potato hash, comes with two poached eggs. To go.
$23. 
There was about 1 sweet potato worth of material and 4 eggs some specks of green pepper and some spices. How is this $23 worth of food? Its not. I get that we are paying for prep work and cooking but come on."
678,"I was absolutely tickled by this place.  My husband and I were visiting a few weeks ago and this place was by far, our favorite dinner.  We shared our dinners - the short ribs which were out of this world and their scallops.  Both were homey, comforting and flawless.  The place definitely has a ""front room"" feel to it.  We will be back."
679,"Excellent breakfast, nice atmosphere, great service, I highly recommend this place! 4.5 stars!"
680,"On a trip with my mom visiting all of the New England states for her birthday, so we found ourselves in Portland for a day. Of course I turned to my trusty Yelp app to give me a great recommendation, and I settled on Front Room.

We arrived for dinner and after driving around a bit, finally found parking. Luckily it wasn't too far away, since there was a nice steady drizzle. We were seated within a few minutes of arriving. Within 10 minutes we were already having a conversation with the nice couple that were seated next to us, just finishing their dinner. They seemed impressed to see that my mother and I travel together for a long time and can stand one another! haha. They mentioned that they were locals, and assured us that we made a good decision. This happened before we placed our meal orders, so let me tell you now I was super confident that I selected the right place!

Within 15 minutes, I had a glass of merlot in my hands, and my mother was telling me that I don't need to drink a lot, so that should be my only drink for the night. haha.  At that moment, I realized just how much I love my mother... no really.

We started with the Cast Iron Skillet Cornbread- my mother is a southerner so cornbread is her favorite. So she is picky about eating other people's cornbread haha. But let me tell you this cornbread was just how she likes it! Plenty of edges, just a bit crispy and buttery... a little sweet. It was perfect... compliments to the chef. I want the recipe!! *wink* haha

I ordered the Braised Beef Short Ribs that is served with mashed potatoes (regular for me, versus the horseradish style), roasted red cabbage, and braising jus. The short ribs were melt in your mouth, fall off the bone delicious! Nice rich flavors! The flavors of this dish really complemented the merlot I selected. No question, it hit the spot. BANGING! I was in food heaven, sitting with my mom, and quite frankly nothing else mattered at that moment. Front Room... y'all made me really happy! This meal absolutely made my trip and gave me life! But wait... there's more. Girl, you had dessert too?! YAASSS. Lol! Key Lime Pie. That is one of my absolute favorite desserts... laaaaawwwddd y'all did it to me!! And it was made in house with a lovely presentation!!! OMG- Did I say I was really happy?! FOODGASM!! 

My mother ordered the fresh fish of the day, I believe it was swordfish, served with soft potenta, spinach and a olive vinaigrette. She added the roasted brussel sprouts appetizer also- which I so happily indulged in. Very good!

Service was excellent. Its a loud place, but I loved the kitchen and the entire feel of this place. Oh Front Room... how I love thee. Your food gave me life and happiness. How my mother who is such a picky eater loved thy food too! We are grateful. I will visit again should our paths cross again. And I definitely recommend this restaurant! *in my terminator voice* ""I'LL BE BACK!!"""
681,"I went into the front room for brunch on Monday morning, and I was impressed with the impeccable service for how busy it was. I went in around 1 pm and it was clear they were busy all day, but the two servers were amazing and patient with what they were up against. My server, Ashley I think was her name, made sure she had the time to give us the service we needed. Our coffees were always filled and mimosas replenished, and she made sure to attend to our every need. I used to be in the restaurant industry, and I was very impressed with the service."
682,"Love this place! The hostess there is phenomenal and an absolute joy. Great food for good prices. This is our go to spot for date night, as parents we tend to be picky for our limited nights out and this place doesn't disappoint."
683,I went to the front room for brunch because it was the only restaurant I could find that had biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were delicious but the sausage gravy itself was disgusting especially the sausage itself. I also had a mimosa which was a bit expensive but good and home fries which were delicious.
684,"The Front Room is a cozy homey feeling restaurant in the trendy Marjan Hill neighborhood, a bit of a walk from downtown. The brunch is very solid, and also popular, so be prepared to wait. The outside is very nice though you are essentially on the street, and is dog friendly. The coffee was excellent. The croque madam was very filling and tasty with a good amount of bread, egg, and sauce. Service was very attentive and friendly as well with no issues. The Front Room is a great place to go for a solid brunch with little pretension."
685,"Tried this place multiple times. The line is usually long to wait but food is worth it. I tried their brunch menu which I enjoyed very much and I really like their mimosa and Bloody Mary! 

This week I tried the restaurant week menu. I ordered a wedge salad, pulled pork shoulder, and a brownie. The salad was fresh, delicious, and it was all gone in a few seconds! The pulled pork shoulder was delicious and full of flavor. You could pull them apart easily and juicy. It was a tad salty but I still recommend it. The restaurant is good about having a large group of people."
686,"Dropped by on a Monday for some brunch.  I had the potato gnocchi with the poached eggs and spinach.  So delicious!  Service was wonderful.  Our waitress even went outside to double check that our parking spot was legal when we noticed that a car was being towed.  So friendly and just very accommodating.

Certainly recommend."
687,"What an absolutely wonderful neighborhood gem. Only waited for 5 minutes to sit at around 8:30 for brunch. 

DRINKS:
I had a mimosa which I loved. My boyfriend had a bloody which was ok.. would give that 3/5 stars on its own. This review is still 5/5 because the service & the food quickly made up for it.

I got their eggs in a boat & he got the sausage ragu. Both were AMAZING. I loved all of the veggie options available for breakfast, & the perfect combo of challah, goat cheese, poached eggs & a mountain of spinach & squash was exactly what I wanted. My boyfriend is more of a carnivore & stared starry eyed into his plate until the very last bite.

Needless to say next time we're in Portland, we'll be back here!"
688,"My fianc√© and I ventured to Portland for a little getaway. On our last day in city, we were determined to find the best breakfast in town. We turned to Yelp for advice and stumbled upon The Front Room. As we walked up the hill toward the entrance we noticed a large congregation gathered outside. We entered and out our name in and started our wait. The bartender was pleasant and helped us to a drink while we waited, the patrons were friendly, and the drink was exquisite. Fresh, tasty and there was no modesty in the pour. The special soup was a blueberry butternut squash soup, with goat cheese! Amazing! We sat and had the gnocchi breakfast it was the best breakfast I have ever eaten! The Hollandaise sauce was amazing! The gnocchi were tender the eggs were cooked to perfection! I would eat here again without hesitation!"
689,"Went for lunch with 2 friends. One ordered a mimosa. Waitress listed off the different flavors they offer and one was chosen. No mention there was an upcharge for this. In fact, the waitress was stellar at upselling because she never once advised when there would be an extra charge for anything. My hamburger was ordered medium-rare and arrived absolutely raw in the middle. I'm talking unable to be eaten, raw. Hostess that cleared the table was advised and did not say a single thing, just continued clearing the plates. We would have told the waitress had she come over to ask how things were or refill a water glass. Clearly the service and food have gone downhill here, no need to go back. There are way too many good restaurants in Portland that offer both great food & great service. This is not one of them.  I see no need to come back here. It's a shame that one of my lunch companions was excited to go as it was her first time here. She won't be back either."
690,"Boom! Good stuff!

Although the vegetarian/vegan options are minimal, they will work with you and try to make the necessary changes you need. I didn't have a full meal but I had a few sides, which made for a big meal. I had the beets, the brussel sprouts and the roasted potatoes..all of which were wicked good. The beets were definitely my favorite.

The location is fun! its right there on Munjoy Hill. The place itself is small but neat and has a cool little vibe to it. The only bad part is the temperature...Ive only been here once and during the summer and it gets prettttttty warm on the inside.

They have a full bar and a TV in the corner to keep up with the Sox! Im excited to go back!"
691,"Lots of good stuff at the Front Room.  Table of 6 - we tried the mussels, cockles and clams, fried pepper app, meat loaf, broiled Casco Bay sea scallops, skate, carbonara, and shepherds pie. Everything was very good. Only criticism is that there is little ambiance and the interior looks kind f run down."
692,"Was there a couple of Sundays ago,  AM for brunch during our first visit to Portland. Though breakfast was free in the sub-par Marriott Residence inn, we thought it would be nice to go out and catch a meal at a local place. 

We arrived, and had a 5 minute (if that wait), were seated, greeted, and provided coffee very quickly (my most important quirk about breakfast places - get me that hot joe asap!). The place was packed and not the quietest place, but I liked that it felt lively. Unlike our home state of MA, we were happy to see an open bar at 10AM, and availed ourselves of a Bloody Mary and Mimosa.

Food was nice. Wife had eggs\home fries\ham, and I tried the potatoes and loved them. I tried the Potato Gnocci w./Spinach and Hollandaise. Gotta be honest here .. I think the poached eggs were the best I've ever had, sauce was terrific. But there was way more spinach than I expected as as a couple of others have said, it got water and drowned the few pieces of potato buried underneath. I could be this is really a dish meant for vegetarians, but I would have preferred a bit more potato and about 1/2 of the amount of spinach and also cooked differently to reduce the moisture. Regardless, we enjoyed the food and atmosphere.

I HAVE to mention that I saw something here I've never seen before in a breakfast joint or diner .. there was a group of people waiting for a table, and I noticed that the staff brought them coffee to drink - while they were waiting. That, to me, is just awesome customer service. 

So I highly recommend ditching the nasty american breakfast with warmed egg-discs and head over to this place, and relax with a nice breakfast and tasty adult beverage!"
693,Amazing brunch and dinner! It is my go to for all occasions. It is now a tradition to go to the Front room for my birthday dinner. They have a few outdoor tables. It is perfect on a summer day. Eggs in a boat and veggie gnocchi are mouth watering.
694,"We came here for dinner with our little dog, and all the staff were not only very nice to us, but very sweet with our dog. There was a bowl of water out for the dog, too. Food was good, husband liked the duck sandwich (although, it was very heavy on the goat cheese) and I quite liked their lamb meatballs and carrot soup. They definitely like their goat cheese here, as both of my items came with a heavy sprinkling as well. Outdoor seating area was small, but each table is enough for a party of two. They had lovely coffee as well."
695,"I'm a big fan of brunch here. Parking can be a bit challenging, but it will be worth it. Nice bar....which I normally really enjoy eating brunch at. Always brunch related cocktails, Mary's, mimosas, etc. I start with Makers and OJ...

Today's items....the hash with over easy eggs was excellent, quality corned beef, perfectly seasoned with a nice sear from a flat press with perfectly cooked eggs...a nice option. The eggs with sausage gravy and biscuits was excellent...scratch biscuits with a great gravy...not heavy or thick..it was an excellent choice with poached eggs on top. The eggs Benedict was well portioned ...I tried a small slice of the Canadian bacon that accompanies it...it was very flavorful...the star today was the gnocchi with spinach and over easy eggs...this dish gets five stars from me....as I kept asking my mother if I could sample more...the gnocchi were perfectly cooked....blanched...ice bath...then pan fried with olive oil...they were delicious...covered with spinach, two eggs, and a scratch pan gravy...

Staff was friendly and prompt....the kitchen staff was interactive....I asked about the gnocchi prep....they spent time with me discussing it....pricing is very reasonable for the high quality of food. I will be back again....as the salmon pastrami Reuben caught my eye. 

Highly recommend....4 1/2 stars"
696,"Now that I've had the trifecta here of breakfast, lunch and dinner I feel I can give it the proper review it deserves. I have never been disappointed by a meal here. In fact, the dinner I had the other night really put this place over the top for me. SO delicious. The food is always good, the service is good and it's in a great location. So why not five stars? Well....there's just something about it. I don't LOVE it there. Maybe it's that it's very loud due to the open kitchen or the fact that it always feels a little too hot in there and like you leave smelling like the food you just ate. There also just isn't a great atmosphere...there just isn't really an atmosphere at all. Whenever we go there it's always like ""well, I feel like we should try some place new and exciting"" but either the place is closed or for whatever reason we can't go, so when we can think of nothing else we go here. It's a really really good fail safe."
697,Great breakfast. Ordered the grilled breakfast bread with my eggs. It was blueberry lemon bread grilled so yummy. My breakfast partner had the croque madam. He licked his plate.
698,"Chose this from a list of brunch places and were very happy we did.  Short wait, nice staff, great food. 

Split a side of biscuits and gravy (bomb), sweet potato hash (complete with carmelized onion, pepper and egg), super crispy delicious bacon and cinnamon sugar carrot bread. 

Pleasantly full after this delicious meal. Would definitely recommend this place for brunch"
699,Met a friend for brunch last week while on holiday in Portland. We opted to wait for an outside table ad the noise level inside was a bit deafening. I enjoyed my mimoss and French toast and the service provided by Jonathan was quite competent.  Look forward to a return visit.
700,"Great experience for what was a snowy night. The cocktails were killer, the small talk provide by the staff were entertaining, the food and presentation was just simply hard to beat! If I had been snowed I I would be there again tonight.

Simple food but done right. The Old Fashion is too die for!

Might have to make another business trip just to visit again."
701,"A great spot off the beaten path, so to speak.  Easy to get to and the location is close to the downtown area, civic center and old port.

The menu is diverse for the group crowd.  Every one can usually find something they like.  The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great to socialize and even have a nice intimate dinner.  Though, that will not happen for a while...ha ha

Anywho...I actually love it in the summer when you can sit outside and people watch.  Give it a whirl and see for yourself."
702,"We came here for brunch looking for a hot meal without a wait, as many other places around town were sporting an hour-plus wait. Little Tap House delivered on the lack of a line and definitely hit the spot, but the brunch menu and the food itself was nothing to write home about. The poutine & eggs were bland, and my eggs over easy were not runny at all. My boyfriend's eggs on his eggs benedict were similarly overcooked.

The place was cute and cozy and the service was attentive, but I likely would not return on my next trip to Portland given the many other options in the city."
703,"This is a cool little date night spot-- we liked spotting who was here on a Tinder first date, along with whether the ""drinks dates"" would turn into ""dinner and more..."" Yep, we've been married for too long. 

It's understated, serving up good drinks and bites. An open space feel-- kinda like being in a barn with barrels for tables. Acoustics are a bit much, but a great, intimate place to have a date, or a get together with a few friends. Gets crowded pretty quickly. 

Since we already ate, we opted for drinks and light bites. Ordered some parmesan truffle fries which came with balsamic vinegar on top. It was okay. We could do without the balsamic, which killed the dish IMO. The Husband ordered several drinks and liked them. Definitely would come back here for light bites or post-dinner drinks."
704,"Very very good BUT! The menu online showed the lunch menu however once we arrive they changed it to the brunch menu. 
We ordered French onion soup, Rueben eggrolls and pomme frittes. They were all good but such a limited brunch menu. Semi-disappointed with selection food was on point. If you're looking for a cool beer, this is the spot. I would like to give four stars but the selection just wasn't there."
705,"I'll get to the food and beer in just a moment. What's the true highlight here is the service. Our waitress - what a gem - from recommendations off the menu to selecting among the 20 plus local brews, she was patient, attentive and so pleasant and professional. When we had further questions out came the bartender and she nailed it from New England style IPAs to lagers to milk stouts. 

On to the food - such decisions to make... Fish and chips?  Homemade burgers? Mac and cheese?  Add the bacon and caramelized onions and it was hard not to go M&C. Made from local cheeses it's creamy and cheesy with just a hint of smoked sweetness. Yum!

We sat outside on a beautiful summer evening and enjoyed the quiet Portland nightlife. And the very best - out waitress- born and raised in Portland - gave us a cheat sheet on local bakeries, beaches and lobsta shacks. We already tried two today!

Thanks Tap Room for giving us some hospitality that makes Maine special. We'll be back for the fish and chips... enjoy!"
706,Beware . The fries came out uncooked and the Mac and cheese came out cold. Lobster roll was also un cooked and had to send back my fries . Wait staff was very nice but food is terrible. Would only go for drinks .My boyfriend got the salmon apparently that was good so if you go there get that .
707,"Honestly, I'd probably give 2 stars, but the place itself was groovy so I am bumping it to a three.

Little Tap House is a small, unassuming place on the corner. There are some barrels posing as tables and you see the bar as soon as you walk in. I took a seat and the bartender took my drink order. I got a sangria and a cheese plate

The sangria was awful. That wasn't sangria and I don't know if it was meant to be a hispter spin on a classic, but it was a complete fail. It was awful. I'm too nice and just sipped switching off between it and water so I could choke it down. The cheese plate was good, but hard to screw that up.

It took a lot of time -  A LOT - for the bartender to focus his attention off of talking to the two guys at the bar about how he's a Washington, DC native and la dee da. Got my check and went on my merry way.

My last night in town I was elated to be heading home after a really long week. I figured, I started my first night at Little Tap House, I'll finish there, too. Thought maybe it would be better. I just wanted something a little sweet and a glass of wine.

Wine list by the glass was extremely limited. The Cab was way too sweet and I wasn't a fan. I ordered a half-cooked brownie with sour cherry jam. Picked the cherries off and ate some of the brownie. It was a D. What was so odd? He sat my drink at the end of the bar for a couple of of minutes as though a server was taking it to a table, then he went and grabbed it and delivered it to me.

Once again bartender was talking to another guy who was from DC. We get it. You're a DC native. Can you just pay attention long enough to place an order and get a check?

Honestly, didn't leave me impressed. Maybe the food is good. I don't know? This place isn't good enough to tout so much pretension. Wouldn't go back, but here's hoping others have a better experience than I did. Twice."
708,"When I lived around the corner, this was ""my"" bar. Now that I live off the peninsula I still make an effort to come whenever I get the chance. Whether it's brunch or dinner or happy hour, it never disappoints. 

I am a huge fan of their ""Beer and Barrel"" Happy Hour special which includes a snack and a small beer for $5. It's everything a happy hour special should be. AND they extend their special hours until 7pm, which I really appreciate. 

Folks are unfailingly welcoming every time I've gone, which fully rounds out the warm and cozy atmosphere they've cultivated. Whether it's hanging on the patio in the summer or snuggling up to the bar while snow falls softly outside the window, it's a standby for me in all seasons."
709,"Place is cool and overall has a great vibe.  Menu is trendy. Found the prices a little high ($29 for a quinoa dish).  Dishes were beautiful though, but mussels had tons of grit that I gave up halfway through, and the mac n cheese with lobster was watery/soupy. Nothing major, but our bill was $98 (incl. $16 tip): one app, two entrees, a beer and a glass of wine."
710,"Little Tap House had never been on my radar until a coworker of mine told me about their amazing happy hour and beer selection. My husband and I decided to check it out one night, and I am really happy we did.

I love everything that Little Tap House has to offer. The moment you walk in, it's dark and intimate, which sets the tone for your dining experience. It was very busy, but the staff was pleasant and told us it would be a 10/15 minute wait. We were sat down promptly at one of their tables and were greeted by our waitress. It was still happy hour, so our waitress explained their specials. The ""Bar and Barrel"" (beer and a small app) of the night consisted of a lager beer from Vermont and a hummus pita dish. We decided to start out with that, and the food was really good, as well as the beer. Their other special for the night was a $5 pint of Lone Pine Portland Pale Ale. After finishing our first beer, we opted for that option. We also ordered the chips with beer cheese, which was decent and fairly big.

Overall, Little Tap House has a great selection of local beers that they take pride in. Their menu is filled with small bites and individual meals, so there is always something for everyone. Happy hour is a gem with $5 house wine pours, their $5 Bar and Barrel option, or their $5 pint pour for the evening. Definitely some place to check out!"
711,"Great spot.  We came here twice on our short visit to Portland.

They have a nice selection of regional beers.  They also have some nice sangria and cocktails.

They change their menu to reflect what it is in season and available from the local famers and providers.  This seems to be a staple for Maine, which is fine with me.

My husband and I only had some small pates and appetizers: Canadian (deviled) eggs, popcorn with marrow butter, etc.  It was very good.  The popcorn was bit heavy on the lime -- but I think the chef was trying to brighten up the flavor of the butter, which makes sense; just seemed a little heavy on the lime.

The staff could not have been more gracious and welcoming.  Make sure you stop by.  It is down the block from the art museum, so you have more incentive to visit."
712,"Efficient, cute and very clean establishment. Loved how the menu was prominently (or fully?) Maine brews. The host was extremely friendly and we were served quickly. Informed about the happy hour combos upon being greeted. 
Only downfall seemed to be the size of the menu-had a hard time picking anything that we liked for a quick appetizer. The portions were generous however."
713,"Went to Portland Maine for the Fourth and brought our pup. This place is a gem. They had refreshing cocktails, I went the tequila route my honey went scotch bourbon route and they did not disappoint! Fresh bright and wonderfully mixed cocktails! 

Even though there was a heat wave, I couldn't resist the Poutine. Crispy cheesy and smothered in gravy with shredded beef omg super happy with this one. After a day of exploring breweries, this meal saved me. Service was great, neighborhood was lovely. I for sure would go back with perhaps more room in my belly and more people to try out the menu."
714,"I stopped in here on a Tuesday evening around 515pm to meet a friend for a quick drink before heading to an activity across the street.  I've been here a couple times, and both times it was for their awesome Happy Hour specials.  It really cannot be beat.  You get a draft beer and appetizer for LITERALLY $5!  The kick is, you don't choose it, it is pre-selected (the beer and appetizer are chosen by the restaurant, and whatever the deal of the day is is what you get, it changes every day).  The appetizer I had yesterday when I was there was an open faced pork flatbread type thing, which was super tasty and well worth the $5 on its own, without the beer!  The beer of the day was an Oxbow Saison, and the flavors of the app paired so well with the flavors of this beer.  It was a perfect marriage in my mind, and again, it was $5, and I honestly couldn't pass it up for that reason alone.  We sat at the bar and the service was prompt, bartender was nice.  The only thing I thought was odd was that she didn't check in with me after I received my food to check in, but meh, not a deal breaker.  I'd like to come back here sometime to try a full dinner at some point, but the Happy Hour specials are so good, I can't pass them up!  Looking forward to branching out soon."
715,"Great ambiance and food. Excellent service. 

Had lobster roll and a burger with a ton of fries and really good beer. Please see pics. Will expound later."
716,"The drinks were great. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the brunch. They were very accommodating with our children and we had a very pleasant experience. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Highlights included the eggs and poutine, Greek yogurt with fruit, and the eggs Benedict. We will definitely be back!"
717,"Forever serving an amazing burger, I'll start there. They have a beautiful full menu, great choices for every course and a large variety of local beers. I love the use of local ingredients and I can always be seated promptly. Thankful they're in Portland and I can hop on over and always expect a great time."
718,Stout was delicious with pomme frites.  Local squash was fresh tasting for zucchini lovers. Lobster roll was on the small side for price but it was very tasty.  Dessert lavender honey custard was delightful
719,"What an amazing place! We came to the Little Tap House as my husband heard about their happy hour deal where you get a beer and app for $5.... How could you turn this down?

We came here on a Wednesday night and were surprised about how busy it was. Even for a Wednesday evening, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes prior to having a place to be seated. We ended up getting seated in the regular dining area despite only coming for drinks and apps.

The good news is that their happy hour deals are available throughout the entire restaurant and not just at the bar.

Their $5 beer and app options vary daily. It is a specific beer with a specific app. Being that I am not a picky person, I still decided to go with it. I can't remember what the beer was, but the app was a hummus plate. The hummus was served over two pita's with some pickled onions. I know it sounds simple, but this was hands down some of the best hummus I have had. The hummus paired with the pickled onions was fantastic. I was so close to ordering a second order.

We ended up getting a second beer and an order of their chips with the beer cheese. The chips appeared to be homemade and the beer cheese dip was very tasty!

Everything from the atmosphere to the staff to the food and the happy hour deals were amazing at this place. I am looking forward to coming back and tying out more of their menu items and happy hour deals!"
720,"This place has everything that I need. :) Local and a nice list of craft beers from around the U.S. and some of the best Poutine in the state. Done.

It's a fairly small space relatively speaking, but once you are inside, the focus quickly turns to food and drink.

The staff here is great. It seems like a family. I see the same smiling faces every time I visit. They seem uber organized, but at the same time so casual and easy going.

There is a decent bar/high top area just as you walk in. There is a TV near the bar area as well.

The menu is creative and everything they prepare seems to be well thought out and crafted and when it all comes together, it feels ""fancy"" in such a casual environment. That's one of the things I LOVE about this place.

They are active on social media posting the latest beer lists, which is usually why we end up there. AND unless I am extremely full, it is hard not to order food.

This is a great place to visit before or after a show or event in Portland. While they don't have a private lot, there is plenty of pay parking nearby. Keep in mind there will be slight inclines as you walk to or from the restaurant if you walk there. But for me, it's totally worth it.

Oh and lastly....DON'T SKIP DESSERT!!! :)

Enjoy"
721,"Went in for a drink. They close fairly early 10 o'clock. My husband got a beer, I opted for a cocktail. It was a cucumber gin drink and absolutely delicious. Bartender and the rest of the staff are friendly. Will have to come back to try the food."
722,"Excellent gastro pub with a greats atmosphere.  The food was outstanding.  I highly recommend the lobster roll.  The owners Brianna and Lee were very lovely and welcoming.  

It has a local vibe to it and it's great to get away from the touristy port area.

It's close to the Westin and across the road from a Holiday Inn."
723,"Recomissioned. This building was never supposed to be a restaurant. It doesn't make any sense. The idea it's a restaurant -- and damn near swanky and hip, at that -- is almost ridiculous. The wall behind the bar is painted white and of half-shattered plaster over brick. The television hangs precariously over the far side of the bar. The hostess podium is located well within the restaurant's floor, forcing and beckoning you in. For as high-class as the atmosphere feels, a Minnesota Wild hoodie dominates the scene on a patron, and flannel and jeans is the most common attire. Yes: you can enjoy The Little Tap House as a sophisticated citizen, taking in excellent, local draft choices not found elsewhere ... or you can wear a hoodie and jeans and order a mass-produced domestic and watch the Celtics game. It's up to you; you can't fail here.

5 stars."
724,Food was ok.  We got the Brussels sprouts and Rueben egg rolls.  The Brussels had a ton of dressing on them and were not crispy.  The egg rolls were one note.  For the price I was expecting better.
725,"I have been a server bartender and a manager of a small restaurant and this place is doing things right!Small menus but Food was delicious, cocktails and beers were on point. Our server who was taking care of the whole restaurant was wonderful. Management was actively walking around and helping staff and guests. It's too bad we live in Rhode Island because we really loved everything about this place."
726,"What's in a name? Little Tap House: Quaint in size, bulky in nature. A neighborhood joint for a jaunt, local enough to smack you right with a potato sack. Potatoes? I thought you'd never ask. A poutine to die for, if the Quebecois caught wind we've stolen their recipe our beaches would be stormed faster than you can say ""1812"". 5 stars."
727,"Only had beverages - delicious (Preble, Samantha & Back Nine). Limited staff but went during the day on a Friday. Would return!"
728,"Little Tap House is a good neighborhood spot for casual dining. Food is generally good but can be inconsistent. I've ordered the same entree over many visits and the quality and the taste of the entree varies greatly depending on who's in the kitchen. 

Cocktails and beer selections are solid, but the overall atmosphere of the restaurant would benefit by having the owners actually turn on the air conditioning on nights like tonight when the summer heat and humidity makes the restaurant fairly uncomfortable. 

Stop and try this west end staple, but don't expect the restaurant to perform as well as some of the culinary elite of Portland."
729,"I loved my meal and cocktail at Little Tap House.  I talked a friend into trying this spot and was very happy we did.  I have been here in the past for happy hour, but never for a full meal.  We had the homemade potato chips and beer cheese dip.  We also had beet carpaccio.  Totally worth the money and FULL of flavor.  

I wasn't feeling my best, so I ordered a cocktail with some bourbon.  It cleared up my sinuses and tasted great!  

We then split a burger and fries.  The burger was perfectly cooked and the fries were crispy and simultaneously soft.  Perfection.

Then we had this enormous ice cream sandwich with homemade oatmeal chip cookies.  This was one of the best meals I've had in Portland in a while.

Now, I've returned multiple times.  One our most recent adventure, our service was ok and the food was good.  There was one weird interaction where we told our server that our cookie ( yes we got that ice cream sandwich again) tasted like strong garlic (this wasn't in my mind, I swear there were two of us who thought the exact same thing at different times).  Rather than our server offering us a different option, he smiled, said nope, he had checked in the kitchen.  Almost like we were crazy.  Didn't seem like the best service practice, but it wasn't enough to make me stay away in the future... Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."
730,"Update:
Stopped in tonight for dinner. Tried the brisket and enjoyed every bit of it. This place truly rocks! I'm tempted to keep this place my little secret in an attempt to avoid the inevitable overcrowding...

I am so disappointed with myself for not trying this place sooner! I stopped in on Monday night for dinner around 8. Sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender. Menu items are simple and priced fairly.
I tasked this establishment with one of the most difficult responsibilities known to man. Cooking ME my favorite cut of beef, the flat iron steak. I requested it cooked medium rare-medium with onion rings subbed for potato salad. The instant that plate was set in front of me I knew there was perfection before me. The meat was well rested and cooked perfectly! Just enough salt and fresh cracked pepper. Rings were great, and the corn was marvelous. I will likely try everything on the menu by the end of the month."
731,"What a wonderful pace for a craft beer, food almost lured me into staying, but I only ended up with my first two pints of Sip of Sunshine!
Happy dance!"
732,"Stopped in before a show to meet some friends and I can't believe how rude the hostess was. She acted like we were bothering her when we asked for a table and all five of us were surprised by the level of rudeness she exhibited. We asked for a table for five and she very rudely told us it would be over an hour, we understood and asked what about if we split up to which she replied ""there are still people ahead of you"" duh...we know how lines work. I said, it seems like you don't want our business and she said whatever, I don't know what you want from me...it was pouring rain but we decided that that would be better than giving this place our money. My sister mentioned writing a yelp review and she told her ""that would be a complete waste of your time"" but, here we are. We also watched her seat people right after us without reservations so I'm not sure what the deal was. I'm disappointed. I love Portland and this place looked great, but overall it was a terrible experience and I won't be back."
733,"ooooOOOOoooh I love the Little Tap House.
Wanna know why?
IT IS THE BEST LIL TAP HOUSE IN THE LAND.
For real, though.
On the corner of Spring & High, this is a place you've probably driven/walked by numerous times and thought ""huh, that's cute"" and then either never thought of it again, or you did what I did and went there to experience its wondrous ambience and plentiful options.

Little Tap House has a mega tap list, so be sure to bring your boozy appetite. You can sit at the bar, or at a table that's made out of a beer barrel. It's cozy inside, but not pretentious - servers are friendly and generally pleased to discuss menu items with you.
I have to say, their watermelon margarita is probably my favorite cocktail in Portland.
It's like someone scooped out a watermelon, threw in some alcohol, and poured it into a glass with some additional watermelon in it. It is so delicious and fresh, I could have ten in a row (though I won't, as I'd probably die).
They have little specials where you can get a certain beer and certain snack for $5 or so. Outdoor seating in the summer is fun, though it's a high traffic area, so be prepared to shout over engines and passerby to get your conversation across.

I would give this five stars except for that it is so unreasonably loud in here sometimes, it makes me want to wear earplugs .There's an odd acoustics thing going on where if there is a shrill-speaking person at one end of the bar, you can hear each of their words perfectly at the other end. This makes the delicious food you're eating a bit less delicious.

Otherwise, this place rules. Come here to have a delish local beer while looking out the windows at High Street and stuffing your face with reasonably priced appetizers.
and the wATERMELON MARGARITA."
734,"If we only lived a little closer -- well, a lot closer -- this would be our ""go to"" place.  From start to finish,  just an excellent experience.  First off -- 5 sidewalk tables were dog friendly.  How dog friendly? The kitchen sent out 'amuse bouche' for not only us,  but also for the 3 Pekes. A tasting spoon with bacon & a sliver of carrot for each!
Great selection of local craft beer,  plus wait staff is knowledgeable about beer styles. 
Dinner was a delight--maple butter popcorn as a  appetizer.  Yum. 
I enjoyed that with my craft cocktail ""Tequila me softly"". ;-)
We both had excellent lobster rolls with well seasoned fries.  Desserts were HUGE and we should have ordered only 1 to share,  but...
Hubby had ice cream sandwich made with 2 very large oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I had an orange fudge brownie with dulce de leche sauce.  Half of it went home. 
Very friendly and professional staff -- all in all an extremely memorable evening!  Try it,  you won't be disappointed."
735,"The food was good and staff friendly, however we have eaten all over Portland and there is much better food to be eaten than here.  The hamburger was delicious and thoughtfully prepared!"
736,"I have NO IDEA why I had never checked out Little Tap House until now??  Well, I guess I kind of know.  Having driven past many many times, when glancing from my car, I had only been able to notice two barrel tables in the front part of the restaurant.  Barrel tables that looked uncomfortable and like no place I would ever want to sit.  SO the other night when a friend texted me and asked me to meet her at Little Tap House, I initially tried to persuade her to meet me somewhere else.  She held her ground and THANK GOD she did.  Five minutes later, I met her at a comfortable, corner TABLE, where we both shared a pretty spectacular dinner.

We started with a homemade potato chip app with a beer cheese dip and a beet carpacio.  Both were fantastic and gave the clear message that the kitchen at LTH was staffed by some serious talent.  We then shared a house burger with fries.  The burger was perfectly cooked at medium rare and the fries were INSANELY good!

Feeling pretty great about everything at this point, we decided to order dessert.  We ordered both a gigantic ice cream sandwich and a new option of shortbread cookies with a smoked citrus curd.  These desserts were both so incredibly delicious, each in their own way, that in one moment between bites, I realized that what might have been a solid 4 star review, had just been knocked out of the park to a 5!  The shortbread cookies were so exceptional,  I had an emotional experience after the first bite.

Before leaving, I started staring at the dishes coming out of the kitchen and everything looked amazing!  I am SO returning!

Once I got home and felt that there was no way this meal could have been any better, I got an email letting me know the Little Tap House was a 7% cash back restaurant through the new Yelp cash back offer!  Wow!  It really doesn't get much better than this!"
737,"The best and cheesiest mac and cheese ever. Poutine is very flavorful but I've had better, would i eat it again yes. Nice selection of beers my bf enjoyed. Love the decor and ambience! It's like romantic calm and gastropubish. The waiters are so so nice and caring. The menu is not that big so we just ordered apps.

Laura is probably one of the best waiters!"
738,"Some of the best looking food around, a touch less salt and it would be 5 stars for flavor also"
739,"Wasn't too happy about the service when we went, took 30 minutes to get our drink order while we watched the bartender just standing behind the bar not doing anything, and then start new orders for customers that walked in after us. ‚Äç"
740,"I absolutely love this place--spot on food, drinks, and wonderful staff.  They have a range of dishes for every pallet.  I had the burger and it's on my top 2 anywhere on this 3rd rock from the sun.  

Give it a try...you will not regret it."
741,"My fiance√© and I recently spent a night in Maine while on Thanksgiving holiday and had a bite to eat at the Little Tap House.  We picked it because the Yelp reviews and pictures sounded intriguing.  It was also raining the night we were there and this was a short walk away.  It is a cozy corner bar type place that is dimly lit when you walk in.  The people there are very welcoming and they seated us as soon as we arrived.  Our server's name was Becca but on that night there were two different servers named Becca so ours was the one with no glasses.  As soon as we sat down and started removing our coats, my fiance√© promptly lost an ear ring!  We get down on our hands and knees to search for it when Becca with no glasses finds the ear ring!  Our hero!

We proceeded to order drinks.  I had an Autumn Mimosa and my fiance√© had a glass of wine.  A lovely way to start any night!  We then proceeded to order some poutine as an appetizer.  I mean who doesn't love poutine?!?!  They didn't disappoint.  There were actual pieces of meat in the fat and I loved it!  Jessica ordered the French Onion Soup with a House Salad.  I opted for the Arugula Salad with Salmon.  It was absolutely scrumptous.  This spot is definitely bookmarked for future visits!"
742,"Stopped by the other day after a long hike in the white mountains, I was starving!! Sampled the brunch appetizer menu and had the lox and pomme frites. Honestly I couldn't decide on what kind of food I was in the mood for, but everything looked fun and interesting. The lox were amazing, with a homemade herbed cream cheese and toasted baguette that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The smoked salmon was fresh and cut thickly. Everything was separated so you can mix and match the portions of each ingredient as you wish! Pomme frites were also amazing, but I was so stuffed from the lox that I barely had any room for all the fries. Can't wait to head back and try some of the other menu options! Oh yeah, and they have an awesome beer menu!"
743,"Got the braised beef poutine. For 14$ it was a steal! It was a nice twist that kicked this dish up from a cheap skate park snack to a full blown prom date meal. The fries didn't sog. The curds were warm and soft. And the beef was enough to feed a small starving family. Best poutine I've had in ages and I go to Canada A LOT. Also the chef gave us a ""tasting"" of picked fiddleheads with Apple and cheddar, which was a nice gesture."
744,"We went here for happy hour on a Tuesday night. The experience was mixed and I will definitely go again and update my review.

Pros:
Very friendly wait staff. 
Great selection of local and craft beer.
Nice space and decor.

Cons:
-I thought the happy hour selection was a bit weak. Only one beer of their choice came at a reduced price along with a few wines and a single small bite option. 
-The food options looked tasty but the prices are a bit steep. I think we expected it to be a bit more casual, at least at happy hour. We ended up just ordering drinks and an order of the parmesean/balsamic fries (which were Ok but not something I'd return for) and continued on for dinner somewhere else.

I will come back to try the dinner menu when I'm more prepared for a higher end meal."
745,Great tap house with local beers and HH has really good deals. Wings were perfectly sauced and burger was delicious. Definitely a great place to try.
746,"When my boyfriend asked me what LTH was like I told him ""It just feels like fall when you enter"".  I absolutely love the decor here.  It's so comfy.  During the week I like to go after class and have a glass of wine and a snack while I study.  I also bring friends to enjoy not only the atmosphere but the great food.  The prices may seem slightly steep at first, but the portion sizes are pretty large.  Along with each meal you get an amuse-bouche that always pleases the palate.  To top everything off, the local beer selection is among the best in the city.  I never stop recommending this place to friends."
747,"I popped by Little Tap House on a rainy day to settle some hunger pangs and was surprised that there was no one inside. The hostess even seemed a little surprised as she hurried over to the host table to greet us. It didn't deter us from settling in because the interior is really cute and welcoming.

I got a flight of local beers, and shared the poutine and the Casco Bay board, which came with smoked salmon. While I can't speak for the authenticity of the poutine, I can say that it was delicious and hearty. It was tough getting through the huge portion, even with someone to share it with. The Casco Bay board wasn't as impressive; in addition to the salmon, there were crostini, hard boiled egg slices, picked radish, and capers. The pairing of items on the board did complement each other, however, and the meal overall was satisfying and well-rounded.

Service was great, especially since we were the only ones dining."
748,"I've been to little tap house before and have never been blown away by my experience. This experience was much worse than others. We waited over an hour and a half for our food. We sat at the bar. The bar tender was so nice and personable and the long wait was not her fault. We asked to speak to the manager who made many excuses for the wait. She offered no compensation or really any meaningful apology for the poor experience. We ordered a burger, salad, and Mac and cheese for dinner on a Monday night. We will most likely not return. The sangria also tasted like hand lotion- again not he bartenders fault."
749,"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend for our first night in with Portland

The place was Cool and the wait staff was very nice an attentive

Poutine- my boyfriend loves Poutine he said it was very good with tons of cheese curds 

Truffle fries- these were good but could skip them 

Mac and cheese- so good cheesy and creamy 

Reuben egg rolls- very good- sauce that comes with them is really tasty to dip fries I ton

Sticky wings- tasty with ranch dip 

Bread and honey butter- soooo goodddd"
750,Great restaurant! Amazingly friendly service (especially the hostess). We came from out of town and this was a great was to kick off our vacation. Extremely kid friendly despite what yelp says. My husband and I ordered the lobster rolls and they were very accommodating to our preferences and we able to make it hot.
751,"Great beer selection! Since I left my review a year or so ago, I've visited many times and had good service."
752,Such a nice little find. Cute barrel tables and candle light set the mood the staff is friendly. We only had some apps and a drink. Great place to make a stop.
753,"Read as 3.51.  We walked over here from the Air BnB where we're staying, maybe a 15 or 20 minute walk.  The food was very good, the service was very good, but the kitchen totally screwed up our meal.  We ordered the popcorn of the day, local honey and sea salt.  We asked that the salt be held but should have asked that it be lightly salted, because having no salt threw off the balance.  That was on us.  I ordered a red blend and Alan ordered a beer sampler.  There were two beers rather than the usual three, four or five, because he only wanted to try dark ones.  One he liked and the other he didn't like that much because it had an aftertaste, although he finished it.  

In addition to the popcorn we ordered Brussels sprouts to share.  I ordered a house salad and ale braised brisket.  Alan ordered the hamburger w/ unsalted fries.  Our server said she would bring them out in courses.  The popcorn was interesting and cool.  We finished it and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Our server kept checking w/ the kitchen and she reported back to us, but a party of 4 seated after us got their food and we were still waiting.  By the time our server reported the kitchen said it would be two minutes, we were pretty angry.  I was not looking forward to the walk back in the dark.  The Brussels sprouts, salad and our mains arrived all at once.  It felt as if the kitchen had thrown our food at us.  The food was very good.  I liked the Brussels sprouts and the brisket.  The salad was large and nicely composed.  The dressing was a little astringent.  It was improved by the addition of goat cheese from the Brussels sprouts.  The brisket came w/ onion rings and carrots.  I gave Alan an onion ring and a bite of brisket.  Even as angry as I was the food tasted good, but it would have tasted better if it had been served in a timely fashion.  Alan liked his burger and fries, a lot.  

He offered to go back to get our car and pick me up and I gratefully accepted.  He left me his credit card so I could pay.  Our server was very apologetic, although it wasn't her fault.  Unbidden, she took $12 off our bill for the wait, which we both appreciated.  I'm not sure we'd return, even though the food was tasty.  It was not the best welcome to Portland and there are other restaurants to explore during our stay here.."
754,"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Little Tap House. They have a great bar - good draft beer selection, nice wine list, and good craft cocktails.  I've eaten here for brunch, lunch, dinner, and later night snacks. I'm also a fan of their winter specials on the nights of the snow-related parking bans.

Among my favorite menu go-to's are the Tap House Burger (really, anything with their french fries is a winner in my book), the fish and chips, and their cheese plates.  The last time we ate there, we both opted for salads with a protein (I had the flat iron steak, she had the salmon), and a side of the Pomme Frites (fries with parmesan, balsamic reduction, and truffle salt). Everything was excellent."
755,Service was amazing and the food was mouth watering.  Loved the ambiance and music... just loved everything about my visit!
756,This venue has a very interesting location as well as intriguing decor. Matched to those aspects is a nice menu and list of available local craft beers. All in all the meal was well executed. Our server was polite and there enough to be helpful but not too obtrusive.
757,This was a great little spot! The waitress was very nice and very helpful. The menu is simple but they have something for everyone. I got a mimosa and the house salad with salmon. It was delicious! Everyone was happy with their meals. We left full and happy.
758,"My favorite lobster roll of our stay! Lemon aioli was perfect! Friendly staff, and great atmosphere (wine barrel tables). Prosecco was refreshing and beer was cold. If you just ate- don't fear, get the lobster roll to go and put it in your mini fridge. That's what I did and it ended up being my favorite! Shame they won't open before we leave this morning or I would get another!!!!"
759,The place is fantastic must must go! Takes a whiles to get your food but its So much Worth it!
760,"On a tip from a good friend I stopped here for dinner. First, the place is on a corner and doesn't look like much. But you have to stop!  DIPA, Tessalation!  Hell yeah.  They serve local beers on tap only. That makes it right there. Support the local community. On top of that, they are a farm to table business. Double bonus!  I had the Brussels sprouts appetizer, Grilled Brussels with beer soaked raisins and goat cheese. So good!  Then to the Braised Brisket with roasted carrots and buttermilk onion rings. Just outstanding. The carrots were sweet and the brisket needed just a fork to pull apart. Onion rings were large and In charge.  Great atmosphere with what looks like a NYC establishment.  I enjoyed this thoroughly."
761,"I've been to Little Tap House many times. Last night I met up with a friend from college that I haven't seen in more years than I care to admit. This was a great place to spend a couple hours catching up. We spent more than two hours catching up, taking up space at one of the few tables. Never once did I feel rushed to get out so they could turn the table over. That's impressive - especially since we did so much gabbing and just a little eating and drinking.

With that said, onto the food and drink. We split an order of the calamari as an app. While the portion wasn't huge, it was just right for two. It was lightly breaded and fried nicely, served with a delicious remoulade. And as an added twist, there were little pieces of fried okra mixed in. Yum! For my entree I had a burger. It was perfectly cooked, delicious and juicy! The fries were also amazing - with just a hint of seasoning. My friend had the fish and chips and she raved about it as well. 

The atmosphere here is cozy and the staff friendly and welcoming. My friend, who had never been, was so glad I recommended the place and is looking forward to bringing her husband soon."
762,"For sure the best lobster rolls we had during our week in Maine. Fantastic beer and wine list. The service was really impressive, too - they bent over backwards to accommodate our kids who really enjoyed their pasta and coloring pages. My favorite meal of our vacation. We'll make a point to go again when we're next in Portland."
763,"Any place with beer, outdoor seating, kind wait staff, and hella delish food of A-OK in my book!!!

Husband is in love with the burger, he would bathe in its glory if he could, the Mac and cheese was yummy yummy, squash mouth watering, chips and beer dip made the little piggy in my tummy squeal!  I will be back and certainly world recommend!!!"
764,"The food and drinks served at Little Tap House were great. I ordered the lobster mac and it came with a healthy portion of lobster. My friends each ordered different items, which they were all happy with. My only complaint is that it took about 45 minutes to an hour for the food to arrive after it was ordered."
765,First time to Maine and tried this place out. Nice place. Service is speedy. My boyfriend and I got the fish and chips to share and it was enough to fill us (I was full the rest of the day having it at 5pm). Their fries were so good- thin and soft but yet crunchy.
766,We visited the Little Tap house for Father's day and were not let down. Service was great and the food was fantastic. I had the beer fondue and it was as tasty as it looked (even more). Plenty of great local beer on tap! Can't wait for our next visit there.
767,"Cute spot with a solid beer selection and attentive, friendly staff; would return to check out their food."
768,"OMG
The Martini's are good & strong.
1st time here. I had the poutine dish which is too die for. OMG- I feel like I died & went to heaven. I'm told the entire; albeit small menu with a large selection of craft beers is a home run on anything you order including an over the top French onion soup."
769,"Amazing service, staff, beer and food!  We had a friends and family gathering on 12/27 at LTH and had called a week in advance to ask if they could accomodate 18 people.  Brianna set aside some tables for us and Dom took care of us.  We can't thank you enough, you may have started a new tradition for us! We love the Little Tap House!"
770,"It was a cold, blustery Sunday afternoon and we had just gotten out of a convention at the Holiday Inn. After being surrounded by people Little Tap House was the perfect oasis to escape the crowds. They had a Sunday brunch as well but we had lunch on the mind so lunch it was. However, I should note their outrageously good Mimosa / Bloody Mary deals. Something to look forward to next time I go for brunch.

I ordered the fish tacos and my partner got the burger with sweet potato fries. Our waitress was friendly and it was pretty quiet. We sat in the back towards the kitchen. I've had a couple drinks at Little Tap House before and sat at the bar but it was a good Sunday afternoon atmosphere. 

My tacos were presented well, with a newspaper wrapping underneath - kind of a play on ""fish"" news. The waitress told me they use it for their fish and chips but thought it was cute to add to the fish tacos. I agree. You get a lot of meat for the fish tacos and the fish cuts were good but my only gripe is they were a little bland. There is a mayo sauce with lettuce that goes on the tacos but it was missing something. Might have been that the fish cuts were too big to accommodate the flavor the sauce was supposed to provide, but anyhow a little bland for me. Maybe some spice could be added as an option?

The burger however was delicious. I had to steal two bites instead of just one. The sweet potato fries were also cooked just how I like 'em - crispy but not burnt. I would definitely recommend their burger and go back for another one next time I'm in the mood. 

I love the interior design in here as well. Definitely a spot to check out next time you're downtown, if the wait isn't too bad."
771,"TLDR: Drink here, eat elsewhere.
5 stars for beer selection and their BYOB (Bring Your Own Baby) events
3 stars for lack of vegetarian options

The best thing about Little Tap House is in their name - their tap list! Ever changing, always local, and always GREAT options for all beer enthusiasts. From dark to light, seasonal and everything in between, you will find something you like at LTH. The staff can usually offer their opinion, or will get you a small sample if you can't decide. There are so many great Maine beers here, I am always pleased.

The atmosphere is fun, decor simple and lovely, and staff have always been friendly. They have a monthly BYOB event on Sunday afternoon, and it is a great way for new parents to get out, have a drink and socialize with other new parents. Each month has a fun (usually seasonal) theme, there is a professional photographer and the place gets packed full of babies, toddlers, and parents! We see a lot of familiar faces at these events each month. It can get a bit chaotic, so if you're not there with a kiddo, I'd avoid during this time. But for parents, it is really a great way to feel like a normal human for a few hours!

Lately, I have really only been going to LTH for the BYOB events, because while their food is tasty, there are VERY limited options for vegetarians. I get that it's a pub, but I could design an entire menu of vegetarian friendly hipster pub foods. The fries and brussel sprout appetizers are good options - but I want MORE!"
772,"The food's not fancy, but it's awfully good. I had the stellar fish'n'chips (solid hunk of fish, good crunchy batter), with a small mountain of excellent thin fries. Two of my companions had big burgers, also with fries. My other companion had a salad and an order of quail eggs (!) which he said were very good. Good beer menu. Finished with ice cream sandwich, get this, home-made oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies with a stout ice cream. Delightful staff. Fully wheelchair accessible, including the bathroom. I love the location. What's not to like?"
773,"Hidden gem in Portland! The mussels are an absolute must - the creole gose sauce is out of this world. The flavor is complex and savory, and the mussels were meaty and fresh. Even the bread that came with it was great, soft yet toasted. French onion soup was also awesome, especially the cheesey crust. 

I also recommend the ice cream sandwiches - made with oatmeal raisin cookies and stout ice cream. It was a friend's birthday and the staff brought it out with candles and sprinkles. We so appreciated the special touch!"
774,Arrived tired and hungry after a cross-country flight and passed this place on the way to the hotel. Wow! What a way to start our trip. The freshest ingredients served up with the maximum flavor. We started with sharing a plate of pickled local beets and a steaming bowl of mussels. We then graduated to a salmon filet and topped it off with an orange brownie in a dulce de leche sauce. We weren't even going to have dessert but everything was so darn good and the service was wonderful. Hubby tried a delicious flight of local beers and I had a very nice Sauvignon Blanc. What a gem of a place. We're kind of jealous Portlanders!
775,"Absolutely an amazing experience! Start to finish 
Bear descriptions were amazing by the waitress 
Also food descriptions as well 
When the food came it was hot and... again amazing!!!!
Mac and cheese is out of this world!!"
776,"Biscuits with honey butter and beer while sitting outside on a sunny Sunday? Can't ask for much more. 
I was pleasantly surprised by this place although it did not have that unique ""je ne sais quoi"" that my favorite ""5 star"" restaurants have. I did not go for a meal here but did try the biscuits and honey butter which were AMAZING! Great tap selection as well, mostly local. I liked the atmosphere both inside and out and the high barrel bar tables would be great for a laid-back group gathering. Outside seating perfect for people watching. The menu looked underwhelming but my friend had the poutine which she said was very good. I would be interested to see their brunch menu (favorite meal!)"
777,"The place gets better and better every time I go in! It's got the feel of a neighborhood bar but the atmosphere of a nicer restaurant. It's cozy without feeling cramped, a perfect balance of having your own space but close enough for the possibility of making friends. The food is original and fantastic! It's perfect for stopping in for one drink or an entire meal! It's also in a perfect spot nestled ideally between downtown and the old port, which makes it the perfect spot to meet people no matter the plans for the night."
778,"Me and my love were walking around Portland trying to find a place to eat when we stumbled upon the Little Tap House.  Top Notch service, fresh, well seasoned seafood and delicious drinks will keep us coming back in our travels to Portland.  Try the Mussels and the Fish and Chips. Amazing!"
779,"Went here for dinner with my sisters on a Saturday night we were quoted an hour, so we put our name in with the hostess and decided to grab a round or two of drinks at the bar. Well it was definitely worth the wait! We were a larger party so we ordered almost every appetizer on the menu: the daily popcorn, mussels, Reuben egg rolls, and poutine all were fresh and delicious. For entrees we all split a Cesar salad, mac and cheese and sweet potato tacos again amazing! If you want great food in a relaxed, welcoming, environment this is the place to go! I highly recommend checking it out!"
780,"This place was recommended by a staff member at the hotel my friend and I were staying at. We decided to go and check it out for ourselves and we were not disappointed. 

We went for brunch at around 12 noon on a Saturday. There was a 20 minute wait and the only options when waiting were to go to the bar area or stand by the door. We stood by the door knowing that going to the bar would keep us there for hours. 

We ordered burgers and beers. Our server was fairly attentive and got our orders right on the first try. Our check came and it was about $70 for 2 people. Not bad at all.

Overall a great experience here and would return again."
781,"Visiting Portland for the first time and overwhelmed by all the delicious dining choices, we decided to ""restaurant hop"" and check out a smattering of brunch/lunch/dinner places in Portland, splitting small entrees and notable dishes each leg of the journey.  The Maine crab cake sandwich is what brought us here!

Despite a slow-ish Monday afternoon (Columbus Day), our server Daniel was all smiles, eager to discuss the menu and even talk travel with us too!  He informed us that the beef and lamb used in their burgers are house-ground and that they source all their ingredients from local farms and companies...neat!

My friend and I split the aforementioned Maine crab cake sandwich, swapping in sweet potato fries for their standard ones at no additional cost (thanks!)  The crab cake was scrumptious, lettuce crisp, challah bread pillowy soft, and the remoulade was the perfect sauce to bring the whole sandwich together.  We had to wait a few minutes extra for our sweet potato fries, but they were well worth it...perfectly crisp and absolutely delicious.  Daniel was even nice enough to split the sandwich and fries evenly, divvying everything up on two separate plates.

Had we not been driving back to NYC soon after our meal, we'd have definitely sampled some of their many available beers and intriguing cocktails...maybe next time!"
782,"I'm pretty embarrassed to write this review. A year ago I was in here an had a great time. Not the case tonight. 

Long story short but my boy friends fish was disgusting. I brought it up with the waiter and he went back to the kitchen and came back an said ""super flakey fish is indicative of fried fish."" I.E. What should be normal. I'm sorry I live on a coast and I know what fried fish should taste like. This was disgusting. This was way overcooked beyond edible. I could have gotten a  better meal from my red lobster or John Silvers.  It sucked. And the fact that he refused to make it better was that much more embarrassing. My flat iron steal was average and nothing to write home about.

So we asked the hostess if the GM was in we could speak to. She said no and the owner wasn't in either and just walked away. No one wanted to fix the situation. So I said ""cool, Yelp is a thing"" and here and I am. It was an awful experience and I'm flat embarrassed this was my boyfriends first Portland (a foodie town) experience. Needless to say I'm welcome to give you my back account for a $40 refund. We won't be back."
783,"This place was cute and cozy, great waitress and great food! Will be coming back :)"
784,"The little tap house has a great selection of beer, but even better than their beer is.....their BURGER!! 

I have eaten there quite a few times and I ALWAYS get the burger (I've been meaning to write a review for quite some time but keep forgetting and I was there last night and that reminded me). I have been waited on by a few of the waitstaff, but I'm usually at the bar and it is usually Robyn who is my bartender/server. Everyone there is great! 

Last but not least, after they set you up with your drink, and they take your order, the chef sends out a small ""spoon like"" utensil with some gourmet ""something"" that he has put together and it is always delicious!

They come highly recommended.

:)"
785,Had the mussels at the bar. Fantastic. Hearty to say the least. Hence the big spoon that came with them. Couldn't eat another bite after. Great atmosphere.
786,"In Maine for work and this was the closest spot to hotel for me to get dinner. I am glad I did. Ordered the Tap burger, medium rare and added some onions. They put a few greens some aioli and a tomato tapenade type thing. It tastes freshly ground, was cooked perfect, juicy and messy. Exactly how I like. The indegredients on the burger we're quality. Local brews on tap. The fries that came with the burger were your standard fare, nothing special about those. I recommend if they want to take this plate up a notch, they should do fresh cut fries.  Would go back next time I visit Portland."
787,"Love this place!  Great brunch, dinner and service.  Excellent burger.   Decent drink menu.   Reasonably priced.  Only complaints - no traditional eggs benedict on the brunch menu and the belgian French toast changed. Bother versions were good, but the first time I got it, it was made of belgian waffles done french toast style, but almost custardy and they were exquisite.  The second time i got the dish, it was three HUGE pieces of thick french toast.  Consistency is everything so I was a little sad to see the change."
788,"We had an amazing burger and even more amazing BLT from here.  They came with homemade chips.  I prefer fries, but everything was outstanding.  This place is a great takeout option if your staying at a nearby hotel and you need a nice meal but roomservice isn't an option.  The place looks nice if your eating out."
789,"My first visit to, Maine and went to dinner here, the ambiance is quite laid back, they offer quite a bit of their home town beers, I ordered the brisket which was ok, unfortunately I wasn't satisfied with the portion it was rather small, but definitely tasteful and tender. You'll enjoy"
790,"Tried Little Tap House on a whim one night, and I'm hooked. Their happy hour specials are not only compellingly priced, but they are also some of the most delicious I've ever tried. Happy Hour goes from 4-7, and they have a $5 special that includes a tasting and the draft beer of the night...it's amazing. Every time I've been there for happy hour, the tasting is new, inventive, and is quite a lot of food! The last time we went it was farm fresh heirloom tomatoes with arugala pesto and fresh mozzarella with a drizzle of olive oil. I can't express properly how simple and delicious it was. 

The beers are nothing to sniff at either! They have constantly rotating taps with some amazing beers. Every visit has been a new and fun experience.

Desserts are pricey ($9 for a brownie) BUT it was also one of the most delicious brownies I've ever had, and came on a plate slathered with light and airy espresso buttercream frosting. 

I can't say enough good about this place. The chef is incredible. We'll be back again, and again, and again...!"
791,"I made it here the first day they opened and had been dying to go back. I finally got the opportunity last night, and it didn't disappoint. The beer list had about a dozen on tap, all craft, and all interesting. About half of them I hadn't seen at other restaurants before, so it's a good chance to try something new. My Baxter hit the spot.

We ordered duck confit sliders, poutine, crab cakes, bruschetta, wings, garden salads and fries. There wasn't a disappointment in the bunch. The poutine had enough shaved beef to feed two people. I'm dying to go back and try the burger, which I've heard raves about. Prices were cheaper than similar Portland restaurants, and very reasonable for the large portions.

The restaurant is much bigger inside than it appears outside. There's oak barrels you can congregate around for drinks, a decent sized bar and regular tables. The service was prompt and atmosphere was lively, even on a Wednesday. I could see this being a weekend happy hour hotspot. Highly recommended."
792,"Pretty damn good food and beer list. The fact that a place like this also sends out an amuse bouche was a bit of a pleasant surprise, as well!

Overall, fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had. My wife got ""The Melt,"" which was cold in the middle, so we had to send it back. Flavor-wise, it was interesting and unexpected, but definitely tasty."
793,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn across the street and decided to go for an early dinner, even though Yelp categorized it as not kid-friendly. Not only were they kid friendly, but they were tourist-friendly, too. Delish drink options (we had a local draft and the watermelon [fresh pur√©e, btw] margarita. Our 1-year-old ordered the buttered noodles (from the kid's menu); we had the warm cracker/farmer's cheese app, the lobster roll, and The Melt. The chef sent out a complimentary tasting of ricotta with honey and sea salt [yum]. Everything was fresh, beautiful to look at and very well prepared."
794,"(Preface: Not a vegetarian [or care about your plant-eating brethren]? Skip to Section B now). 

~Section 1~
My counterpart and I had heard that Little Tap House had an excellent brunch that was seriously flying under the radar compared to the heavy hitters in town. Excited at the prospect of a new place to eat my favorite meal at, a friend and I met Saturday mid-morning. Let me preface this by admitting she and I are both vegetarians. Our options, therefore, were pretty limited:

- The Bloody Mary ($5 on Saturday/Sunday mornings): Was a NO go. They pre-make their bloody mix in the AM and it includes Worcestershire (which, as we know, has anchovies). They will NOT make you a fresh drink without Worcestershire, and since I don't drink fish, I couldn't get a bloody. Huge disappointment here.

- Triple Cheese Grits with two eggs ($9): This was pretty much the lone ""brunch"" type thing we could order. While it's said that the grits are made with smoked cheddar, cheddar curd, and swiss the only things I could really taste was a lot of salt and generic cheese flavoring. Our eggs were cooked great, but... I think without the addition of Sriracha, we would have eaten less than we already had (my counterpart didn't even finish hers).

There definitely are other options for vegetarians: house chips with truffle parmesan and beer cheese fondue ($6, but I'm guessing that it's deep fried alongside meats, so that turns me of), cauliflower gratin with - again - beer cheese fondue ($6, what's with all the beer cheese fondue here?), and a grilled cheese (made with cooper sharp, tomato tapenade, and caramelized onions) for example. For me, personally, there's nothing food wise here that excites me. Unfortunately, vegetarians just don't fair well with pub fare, which is essentially what LTH is offering.

~Section B~
What DOES excite me - and what I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE about Little Tap House - is:
a) their Bar & Barrel app and draught $5 offering during Happy Hour Monday through Friday. Sure, most of the time it's stuff I can't eat. But every now and then there are gems (recently: tomato bisque with petite grilled cheese paired with ""Gose"" by Rising Tide Brewing Company, for example); 
b) every time I've been here the staff has been just VERRRRRRRRRY nice, patient, and accommodating as much as they can be; 
c) the space and interior decoration... there's A LOT of wood here. And I REALLY like it. I feel like I could be drinking in the Captain's quarter of a fashionable pirate boat (this makes no sense, I'm sure, but... it's just the very unique vibe I get);
d) the BYOB (Bring Your Own Baby) events they have for new mom's once a month that encourage they come out AND bring their babe with them. Don't have a kid myself, but damn it if this isn't one of the coolest things any bar in town is doing, then I don't know what is. GOOD ON THEM FOR DOING THIS!!!"
795,"Ordered the tap house burger to chef's specifications and was very pleasantly surprised. Service was excellent - oh and the beer isnt half bad either! 
Seems like a great place for a date night or a weekend brunch."
796,"We went here last night for an early bite to eat.  I loved the concept.  

I ordered the Poutine and the Fiddleheads. The poutine was one of the best I have had.  The blend of meat, gravy and cheese curds were perfection!  Fiddleheads are a local thing here in Portland and cooked with bacon and goat cheese how could they be anything but delicious.  

My hubby  got the potato chips and beer fondue followed by the pork spareribs and risotto. Both were incredibly fresh and tasty! 

The cons: It was way to warm in there and we found our  (it is a beer bar) to be served warmer than they should be.  The service was a bit slow to start even though the restaurant was also slow.  But the server was pleasant and the service got better as the meal continued.


Review Edit:  The last few times we have been here the service keeps going down. It is always terribly warm in there and the service seems to be slower and slower every time we go.  Last time we went we waited an hour for our food and my Medium burger came out raw in the center. How does that happen?  They took it off the bill and the food is still AMAZING except for this one burger incident."
797,"This place was a Yelp success story for us.   We pulled into Portland with no idea where to get lunch.  One in our party suggested ""lets just walk around and see what we find"" - that did not work.  Checked Yelp on my phone and we were 1/2 a mile from Little Tap House.  Turned out to be a great choice.   The staff was very welcoming, like we had been there 20 times before.   We ate at a hightop in the bar.  Wife and daughter split a burger, I got the Reuben egg rolls.   Food was great, beer was great, service and staff was great.  Other's in the place were getting brunch type food.....that all looked very good too!  Would not hesitate to return."
798,"This is an update to my earlier review because we had not experienced the full menu/experience of the little tap room.

I have to preface it with the fact that we came here during restaurant week where most establishments turn up the charm and the flavor of the menu but nonetheless our experience here was a very good one.

We had a bit of a wait for a Thursday night but with the frigid temps outside I think people were running for cover to get somewhere warm and inviting.

We started off with the tasty cheese plate that had three types of cheese on it from fresh and delicious (which I am not normally a fan of) blue cheese and some smoked soft and delicious cheese and a side spoon of honey and a buttery substance.

We then done into some pub style onion rings that were topped with an aioli of some sort but were light and delicious.  Then my friend dove into a piping hot lamb shepards pie that he said was delicious served in a small crock pot and I had the lightly beer battered haddock sandwich that was covered in small balls of mozzarella cheese I think.  It was not your typical pub style fish sandwich that is super greasy and heavy.  It was divine!!

I then had the delicious profiteroles that were similar to freshly fried dough that came with a side of chocolate sauce and powdered sugar but were to die for and I wanted more ... Quite frankly if my whole meal were these morsels I would have gladly accepted.

They had a huge selection of local brews on a separate menu ( little steep in price for the size of glass) but hey I love crafts brews and am willing to dish out for it.

Service was spot on where the hostess and the waitress were attentive and super friendly.

We would definitely come here again to see what the ""normal"" fare is like ... Only drawback was the amount of seating but who isn't in that space in downtown Portland right?"
799,"I just ate at this place ""The Little Tap House"" Absolutely the best decision I've made on our last day in Maine. Lobster roll is the best I have tried of all the other places we had been to during our five days Maine vacation. Being Asian I have made is spicy with some hot sauce.  The cocktails are also refreshing and good."
800,"First thing you need to know about this place is if you get there after 8 a.m. for breakfast on the weekends, you're going to be waiting 45 to an hour.

And it's soooooooooooooo worth it.

My wife and I recently spent a long weekend in Portland and were looking for a breakfast place on Saturday. On the suggestion from the front desk at the hotel, we checked out this place.

Whoa. Coffee is amazing (the blend is made by the local Coffee By Design coffee company just for BAC). We're admitted coffee snobs and we couldn't get enough of the stuff.  

Then there's the menu ... ye gods, the menu.

After agonizing over what to order because we wanted one of everything, we both chose the Bistro Steak Eggs Benedict. 

Best. Benedict. Ever. 

Two beautiful Black Angus bistro steaks nestled all happy on top of sun-dried tomatoes, two poached eggs, Italian cheese blend, and slathered in roasted garlic cream sauce on top of fresh English muffins. Seriously ... could this BE any better?

No, it cannot.

To top it off, our waitress, Crystal, was a cool cat who was fun to talk to. In fact, she was so badass that we HAD to visit for breakfast the next day and sit in her section. Ask for her...she's a rock star.

Went the next day and got there around 7:30 a.m. and were sat immediately (I had an amazing scramble and the Mrs. went with a traditional eggs over easy...awesome). By the time we left around 8:30-ish, the wait was almost an hour.

We'll definitely make this place our go-to breakfast stop next time we're in Portland."
801,"You know what - no, Bayside, no.

There are very few restaurants that make me want to wait over TWO HOURS with NO waiting space.  This is not one of them.  (They are hot Suppa and Boda, btw).  

Furthermore, the hostess won't even take your number and text or call you and there is no call ahead.  

This is a standard American breakfast with a few notables.  Homemade hash (which you can get many places in Portland including Beckys), cinnamon roll pancakes (which are good but sometimes underdone in the middle depending on how rushed the kitchen is - see above two hour wait), and that's pretty much it.

Go to Beckys for a shorter wait and cheaper but equally good food or try Isa right across the street for innovative brunch!"
802,"This place is so quaint! 

Came here on a Monday off from work for a late breakfast/brunch with a friend. We were greeted by a cheery host who quickly showed us to our upstairs table. The place itself is cute ad homey but it doesn't seem like there's much dining space so I can imagine that it gets crazy busy on the weekends.

The menu was great - lost of options for sweet and savory. The omelette selection was large and it's build your own which I thought was cool. I went with a classic eggs benedict which was buttery and delicious! My friend had the steak benedcit (I think?) The steak was cooked perfectly. For drinks we went with a bloody mary (spicier than most that I've had in the area which was yummy) and a mango mimosa...something different. Overall I'd go back to try some of their sweeter options but it's a cute place for a nice breakfast."
803,"The wait can be long. We came at the tail end for brunch, and we were extremely impressed and happy that they served us so late! AND they gave us all the courtesy and respect without any rush. 

I ordered the Louisiana Bayou Benedict - andouille sausage on top of cornbread hotcakes with two poached eggs and a spicy Cajun hollandaise sauce to top it off. This was different, but I liked it. 

The mimosas... since we had came in at the tail end, the prosecco/champagne that they used was flat (so I can't say much about that), but the drink had a strange aftertaste to it. I'm a mimosa enthusiast, and I would say the flavor just wasn't appetizing."
804,"After reading an article on how this is one of the best benny spots in Maine I was compelled to check it out. Arrived early- about 8 on Sunday- and had no issues getting seating in a few minutes. I would recommend the same for anyone that had complaints about waiting. Honestly, the foods alright and I am again confused as to who gets to write these published food articles. I had a classic eggs benny and was very underwhelmed. It was well cooked and bloody but bland. Hollandaise was bland...just really nothing to write home about. Wifey had a cajun style benny which was very good I have to admit.  It had a cajun hollandaise and corn style muffin with sausage. Very tasty but equally spicy. Ordered corn beef hash which was also very bland and nothing special- look at the picture and tell me if thats an 8 dollar corn beef hash. Lastly, awful home fries. Mine were undercooked- too hard. Wifes were okay but the seasoning was off. Service was great, atmospheres fine, just the food isn't some out of this world experience. Give it a shot but don't expect to be floored as it may take away from the experience."
805,"YES. 
This brunch was so so so good. Plus, they serve brunch every day of the week! 

Family run, we were greeted at the door by the owner who quickly cleared a table and then walked us upstairs to our table (we came at 10 am on a Tuesday). He was so nice, as were the servers. 

My friend and I shared the crabcake Benedict and the Beurre Noir scramble, both of which were incredible. 
The Benedict was an English muffin topped with crab cakes, a perfectly poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. 
The crab cakes were made of finely shredded Maine crab and were so so delicious. Only downside of our whole experience is that my friend found a shell in her crabcake, so be careful (could have just been a one-off fluke though). 
The hollandaise sauce was also great, less lemony than some but still not too rich (and I'm not the biggest fan of hollandaise, but they won me over). 

The scramble was eggs scrambled with local North Spore mushrooms, capers and parsley, plus we added tomatoes. 

Both dishes came with homefries, which were a mix of regular and sweet potatoes, perfectly cooked and seasoned. 
The scramble comes with a choice of bread, of which I chose white. The bread is made in house (as are an incredible amount of things on the menu) and is so good. 

This was a meal that we were sad to see end, since everything was so delicious. 
I will DEFINITELY be back."
806,"Bayside has a unique place to eat. I think inside it said that it was an old hotel (don't quote me). We had a little bit of a wait but not a terrible one. It's brunch food so if you do find yourself with a wait they conveniently have coffee you can drink while waiting. 

Our food was pretty good! The home fries were not as crispy as some may like (or me) but I liked my classic eggs Benedict. The guy waiting on us was good at his job!"
807,"God how I hate to do this. But, it just isn't the same place it once was. I used to LOVE this place. Now, it's just sad. The waits have grown longer, the food quality and caring has decreased sadly.

I used to come here often. I loved their hash and their bennies. The home fires? They used to be deviously good. I'd dream about them. The veggie homies.... oh god. Divine. But then... something changed.

The last few times have been... just ok. Nothing special. And definitely not worth the wait. For example:

The last time the wife and I went, I ordered the hash with home fries, she ordered the veggie homies. Not only had the quantity decreased vastly (what used to feed my wife for breakfast and lunch, now barely satisfied her breakfast hunger, and she's pretty small), but the veggies were severely over cooked, slimy and just not good. Then... my plate.

The hash was good, as always, though very small portion. However, the home fries? Cold. And I don't mean room temperature. I'm talking cold. I told my waitress and she said sometimes they make them first then leave them sitting on the counter while the rest cooks. Ok, no excuse for cold food at these prices and wait times. She asked if I wanted them. Uh... yeah I'm paying for them?!? She sent them back and in turn I got half done home fries in a box to go. Not great. I didn't complain cause we had been there for a while and I can tell she was frustrated. My bill didn't reflect any difficulty nor was there ever an apology. 

So... yeah. Worth a trip. Food is... okay, no longer amazing. Service not great. I understand everyone has a down day, but we've noticed a spiral numerous times recently, to the point we have ceased going there. Sad to think of what it once was."
808,We waited for 1.5 hours after being quoted 45 minutes. Then waited another hour to get our food. No one really said sorry or apologized for the inconvenience. The food was good but definitely not worth a 2.5 hour wait.
809,"All the stars!!! I am not a huge breakfast or brunch person but damn if Bayside didn't turn me into one on this trip. 

Rule #1, it doesn't matter what day of the week you want to stop by, make sure you're super early or you're gonna be waiting. 

Rule #2, order the cinnamon bun pancake. If you want to order something else, just order the kids size on the side. It's still huge. And it's still worth it. 

Rule #3, order whatever in the world you want because I can't imagine it would be anything short of amazing. I loved the lobster Benedict but I'd probably try another one next time. The blueberry lemon French toast was amazing. The egg scramble was great. 

Finally, i forgot the names of the servers, sorry!, but we had a boyfriend and girlfriend who served us in separate days and they are into metal detecting which i thought was awesome. They were fantastic and really made our breakfasts even better!"
810,"This review can be summed up in three words: Eat here now! 

We stopped in while running errands on a Friday morning and were sat at a table upon entry. Our waitress told us that isn't the norm as they typically have a wait. That would not stop us from returning. 

The food and selection were all amazing. Service was prompt and friendly. The price was great.

I highly recommend the Cinnamon Bun pancakes. They're as good as the hype."
811,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafriad to reference or not reference, put it in a blender..."
812,"""This Lemon Blueberry French Toast Saved My Soul""
Great service, Great Food, and Good People.

The wait time wasn't too bad and the food came out quickly.  Watch out for busy times though! Overall the food was fantastic and the servers were fun. I would consider this a staple in my visits to Portland."
813,"Dined at Bayside American Cafe on a Sunday morning of Labor Day weekend. They do not take reservations, at least on Sunday mornings. Understandably, the place was packed! As we had heard such great reviews, we waited for a little over an hour for a table. As long as the wait and line were, they moved quickly! There was also a coffee station downstairs for the people in line which was nice.

We ordered a cinnamon bun pancake, hash browns and an Acadian omelet. Everything was delicious! My partner said the omelet was the best he's ever had. The pancake was also great but i could have used a little more of the cinnamon swirl. 

Overall a great experience!"
814,"Decided to come to this restaurant for brunch, and I'm SO glad I did! First of all, the decor is just adorable and classic. Most of the seating is upstairs with outdoor seating options. 

The food: Ordered the Louisiana Bayou Benedict and blueberry and banana pecan pancakes. The Louisiana Bayou Benedict comes with long spicy sausages (not patties). The eggs were delicious, though I usually like them a little more runny. The pancakes were VERY impressive with HUGE portions and super fluffy and thick - 3/4 of an inch at least. They were not shy with the pecan or blueberries. 

The service: VERY friendly and professional. 

Highly recommend for a quiet brunch."
815,"We were told to check this place out when we came to Portland - spot on recommendation.

So we came at prime time on Saturday and the wait was about forty minutes, but that was to be expected.

I decided to try the Lobster Eggs Benedict (which shocked my wife because I am not an eggs benedict fan) because I saw them at a few tables and they looked great.  That was a smart call - they were delicious!!  The 'home fries' were seasoned cubed potatoes with an almost Cajun flavor - but they were good.

My wife ordered the Homemade Hash which had the home fries, corned beef, brisket and eggs - she totally loved it.

We saw a special item - a pancake with blueberries and cinnamon in the batter and topped with a cinnamon glaze drizzle.  We only ordered one to share (which was good because they are BIG).  Wow - amazing!!  Could've been a dessert - wow - yeah - really good.

The staff were all very friendly and it was a totally great breakfast"
816,"Come to American Bayside Cafe for fantastic weekday brunch! There's always an outrageous wait on the weekends, but on a Thursday at noon, we were immediately seated upstairs in a springy booth next to a old-timey bar. Even in the small space, which is an interesting mix between a homey diner, and a dated, dimly lit bistro, we felt cozy but not cramped. 

Upon ordering the infamous cinnamon bun pancakes, my waitress noted that they were they best dish they offered- I had made the right choice. She was right. She was, however, quite misleading about the size of the pancakes when she formed a measly circle with her palms as a  representation. So, being foolish, I ordered two. They were massive-bigger than my face and covering a dinner plate twice the size of normal ones. Don't think I'm complaining about the size though, because the pancakes were glorious;  thick and fluffy, a donut-batter flavor, a swirl of crystallized cinnamon sugar present in each bite, and a generous drizzle of a sweet, tangy, cream cheese icing. I nearly swooned at the taste. It was heavenly- a giant cinnamon bun in pancake form. ($8!)

Don't leave without ordering the cinnamon bun pancake, but don't order two- unless you're a champion eater. Despite the irresistible taste, I couldn't fully finish one. That being said, I now have a whole other pancake to look forward to for tomorrow."
817,"Oh.My.Goodness... how have I lived in Portland for 8 months and not been here yet??? No, don't answer... I'm a duffus!!

My nephew was in town and saw a picture of the cinnamon bun pancakes so we visited on his last morning in town.  The building is very low-key in a small (what looks to be an) original building on Portland Street. Being mid-week in the off season there was no fighting for the street parking and no wait - straight upstairs to a lovely little booth we went.

The breakfast was just amazing; the service was awesome.  The cinnamon roll pancakes (which I just stole from his plate) were to die for, but unless you haven't eaten in, like, a week, only have ONE!  I had the home made Black Angus hash.  OMW... big chunks of real corned beef that just melted in the mouth.  I can't say enough, and can't wait to go back and take hubs next time."
818,"A Portland Brunch Must! 

They have Benedicts galore (Louisiana Bayou, Crab Cake, Maine Lobster, etc)  and serve up some tasty Lemon Blueberry French Toast! We waited a tad too long for my liking, but were seated on a lovely porch. Our server was kind and the food (especially that French Toast) made up for the wait."
819,"I can safely say this is our new favorite breakfast spot in town.  The servers are sweet, the food is inventive, atmosphere is cute, but best of all the execution of each dish has always been impeccable.

I came from Portland, Oregon, land of all things brunch (well, a good happy hour scene too), but suffice it to say that I am no stranger to a popular breakfast spot.  I've waited for hours, tried many ""it"" breakfast places, and have tasted a lot of good food from eggs and bacon to kimchi and rice breakfast bowls and everything in between.  Bayside American ranks up there with some of my favorites.

First, I love the creative menu options: steak Benedict (which my man swears by), a root vegetable hash, cinnamon bun pancakes, and few others that are just....different from what you'll find elsewhere.  My test for ordering breakfast is ""can I make this at home"" and for many of the options at Bayside American, the answer is a resounding no (or not without a crazy amount of effort) and so the menu makes me happy.

Second, I love the staff.  Everyone is friendly and helpful, not just in the standard server way, but staff are always actually trying to connect with us and with the other diners.  I often hear a server ask a diner about their plans for the day, only to end up launching into a whole great list of other activities and sites to see in Portland (especially in the summer when everyone in Portland seems to be a visitor).  Love it!

Third, not only is the menu great, the food is great!  Everything I've tried has been perfectly executed.  You ask for your eggs soft- they come out soft!  You ask for your steak benefit medium- it comes out pink in the middle!  I tried the smoked salmon Benedict last time and it was wonderful: the perfect amount of each ingredient so each bite was scrumptious.  Yum yum yum.

Last, the atmosphere is warm and cozy, which I love.  Most of the dining area is upstairs and with the cozy booth seating and wood paneling around it just feels homey.  I love settling in for a breakfast in a place with character and the faint whiff of wood.  It is also small...so there always seems to be a line.  I always go before 8 because I am OVER waiting in line, but even if I had to go later, it would be worth the wait."
820,"I came in with my friends for brunch on a Monday morning. While we were waiting to be seated, they offered us coffee which was nice. The place is quaint. 

Our waiter was nice to talk to. We ordered our food and it looked awesome. I got the huevos rancheros which I was not a big fan of, I regret it. Looked good but tasted eh. My friend got some cinnamon pancake that was amazing. 

OK so I am going to sound like a broken record because I've mentioned this in a previous review but there was no condiments on the table. My friend had to find half and half because we couldn't find the waiter for a bit. There was no syrup which my friend had to remind the waiter twice about. One of my friends had to leave early and the waiter accused her of drinking coffee and was going to charge her for it which she did not order, she had grabbed my coffee to find half and half. I liked the waiter but that bugged me. Service was good in the beginning but turned mediocre at the end."
821,"At last I got to eat brunch at the famous Bintliff's/Bayside American Caf√©!
I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday midmorning. Here is the lowdown:
GREATS:
- The eggs benedict ($14). Um, my life is changed. I got the classic benny, sans bacon, and added baby spinach and Portobello mushroom. I have never tasted anything so scrumptious in my life. Such a delicious sauce, fresh vegetables - and the hashbrowns served with the dish are out of this world. Seasoned deliciously, and perfect for soaking up the egg.
- The dining area itself - we requested to sit upstairs as I'd never been here and wanted the full experience. The upstairs is so beautiful. It's cozy, homey, warm, welcoming, charming - there are some booths and tables. Our booth was fabulous with a vintage shaded lamp and comfy seating. Just really great ambience.
- Mimosa was great. Steep at $8 - but the special Mango Mimosa was killer. Heftily sized.
- Coffee - they serve Coffee By Design. This is seriously the best coffee I've had recently.

MEHs:
- Always always always a wait. There is also virtually no space to stand while waiting; we lucked into the two chairs in the entryway, and a doable thirty minute wait. Be prepared.
- The service was lukewarm. Our waitress was super friendly, but she didn't check on us at all. We wanted another round of breakfast cocktails, but she was discussing her life with another customer for the duration of our meal, and by the time she came over to us, we were done. She didn't ask us if we wanted refills, either...
- The French toast. Skip it. I got one slice with strawberries for $7. It was tough, entirely dry, and didn't taste like French toast - it was essentially a big piece of raw Texas toast that was impossible to cut with a fork. Not good.

Come for the cozy booths and eggs benny; bail when you are ignored for 40 minutes. Can't win em all!"
822,"Came here for breakfast on the last day as the place we attempted to go to was closed. 

It's a cute, intimate spot that you can tell is a local favorite. Our server, as well as the hostess, were bother incredibly nice. 

After browsing the menu I had about 4 options rolling around in my head but ultimately went with the Louisiana Bayou Benedict dish because corn cakes and andouille sausage are hard to pass up. 

It was some of the best Benedict I've ever had. The eggs were perfectly poached, the sausage had an excellent kick, and the corn cakes were soft and delicious. And the hollandaise sauce? I need that in a bottle to take home. It had just the right amount of spice and was the perfect consistency. 

After dining here, I'm glad our initial plan fell through because this spot knows what they're doing!"
823,"Good veggie hash and fresh bread, they made thier own bread daily!!! Tasty breakfast ."
824,"This place is a gem. I walked in and had one goal in mind - eating a benny. I asked our server, which is best - the steak, lobster or smoked salmon. He threw a curve ball at me and said ""None, the crab cake is the best; and better price too."" 
Food: Everything was flavorful and delicious! THE CINNABUN PANCAKE IS LIFE CHANGING. THE GOLDEN CRUST, but not intensely sweet - IM STILL DREAMING ABOUT IT... and I don't even like pancakes... 
Also - get the crab cake. 
Atmosphere: Very homey vibe, cross over between a classy diner and cafe. 
Service: 10/10 - our server recommended the best food and portions for our group, as well as gave us ideas for how to spend our weekend in Portland!"
825,"Generally speaking, I've greatly enjoyed Bayside American Cafe for years. They do have a few gluten free offerings, but not many. My favorite is the homemade hash as an eggs benedict. 
They often have a VERY LONG wait (one hour). 
GOOD service is REALLY important. The last time I went, there was no wait and we were placed on the deck as requested. Service was NOT good, and at times almost rude, and it was a disappointing experience overall. Others were seated after* us and served* before* we ordered or got our meals. Others came after us and were gone before we got our meals. We didn't feel valued as customers and neither of us has really desired to go back since."
826,"We went here a year ago during a trip to Portland and I've been fantasizing about those Scallion Cheddar Bacon Pancakes with their Bourbon Maple Syrup ever since! 

This place does a great job of one-upping the standard breakfast classics without losing its 'comfort food' vibe."
827,"What an amazing Portland breakfast spot! After reading all of the rave reviews, we had to find out what we were missing. The place is small, and usually crowded, but lucky for us, we love Maine in the off season, so we walked in and were seated upstairs immediately. 

The coffee is fresh and a great start to the morning. We ordered a single cinnamon roll pancake to start things off. BEWARE. These are huge. One pancake covers the plate. It was light, fluffy and very flavorful. The iced toping is good, and it eliminates the need for syrup in my opinion. 

I felt the urge to satisfy my corned beef hash craving. Large chunks of angus beef with a medley of potatoes. Great robust flavor and very filling. My wife ordered the Eggs Florentine. I was lucky enough to steal a bite. Truly something to indulge over. The sauce is perfect, the portion is perfect, and it's all accompanied by home fries cooked to perfection. Don't skip past one of the Benedict's.

Cannot wait to come back and try something else!"
828,"This was the top brunch recommendation I got when I told my friends I was headed to Portland for the weekend, and Bayside did NOT disappoint! We had a reservation for our group of 12, which ended up having to be split into two tables which was fine . The place is very small and really can't accommodate super large groups because of the layout of the space. It does however, have a very homey and comfortable vibe, like you are eating at an old inn, which I love for brunch. That being said, the food alone was what made this place a 5 star spot for me. Brunch is one of my favorite meals when done correctly, and the chef's at bayside know what they are doing and are not cutting corners. The 3 potato home fries are genius, and a perfect side on all of their dishes. I had the corned beef hash (smaller serving size) which was not only the perfect portion, but it was cooked to perfection and I didn't feel sluggish after eating from to much oil/fat. We shared the cinnamon roll pancake as a table, which is a must try and is absolutely delicious. Everyone really loved their food and the service was great, and the prices rather reasonable. The Eggs Benny in various formats were a hit with everyone who got them, as well as the sweet options of french toast and pancakes. Mimosa's, bellini's, bloody's and more are available if you are into a boozy brunch, and the glasses are honestly huge so definitely worth it!

Make a reservation and get down to Bayside! I will be back for sure the next time Im in Portland!"
829,"Portland should have more places available for brunch during the weekdays, but they don't. You can count on one hand where you can get a delicious benedict and an adult beverage on a Wednesday at 10am, and that to me is seriously disappointing and frustrating for a city that's constantly making ""Best Of..."" lists. 

The point if that rant is: thank you, Bayside American Cafe, for being one of those awesome places serving up elevated breakfast foods midday, midweek. Thanks for having plenty of space in your restaurant so that the wait is never more than 20 or 30 minutes (and even then, you often overestimate the wait time which delightfully surprises us when our name's are called far earlier than we thought it would be!). Thanks for having a coffee-while-you-wait station. That's all awesome stuff!

That being said...
- The Food
I think there are some really creative looking menu items, but the execution is never quite what I'm expecting. Everything I've ordered just comes out underwhelming in presentation and preparation. Big plates with small under-seasoned portions. The breakfast cocktails are also a bit of a let down: the bloody mary's aren't vegetarian friendly (they contain anchovy), and the other drinks are cloyingly sweet. My perfect brunch is plentiful and flavorful, and Bayside American Cafe just isn't that for me personally. HOWEVER, it's important to note that the best pancake in the entire world is found here. So, whatever you do, no matter how full you are, order a Cinnamon Roll Pancake!!!

- The Service
The servers here are SO friendly and SO accommodating to dietary needs, but I often feel forgotten about. It's weird to me to have to ask another server if my server is still available because I never received a menu, or the drinks I ordered, my food never showed up but my bill did, etc. Waters and coffees are never refilled, we're never checked on, etc. And this has happened every time I've come. I know being a server isn't an easy job, I know that it's never not busy at this restaurant, but... it's frustrating when other similar establishments in town make customer service look, seem, and feel effortless. 

I know I'm in the minority on this one, and that's okay. You'll probably love it here! As for me, I'm a devoted brunch enthusiast of another place in town, and I think I'll just stick to going there!"
830,"Bayside American Cafe is probably one of the best hipster cafes in Portland, Maine. We were visiting from out of town and came here on a Monday morning around 10am, and there was still a line outside. We went inside to put our names down, and had the wait staff tell us that it would be around 45 minutes. 
While we waited, we were able to get decaf coffee and regular coffee in mugs while waiting outside, which was a nice touch. After 45 minutes, we were called, and taken to our table upstairs. 
The interior of Bayside is very charming, much like a quaint British tea parlor. A waiter brought us menus and water immediately, and we ordered shortly after. 
We had the lobster frittata and lobster Benedict. Both were very fresh, filling and delicious. My frittata had a generous heaping of lobster on it, and i had also opted for honey wheat bread, which Bayside make themselves. Super delicious. 
Service was really friendly and hospitable. 
Well worth the wait and probably one of the best cafes in Portland."
831,"This place has an amazing brunch. I mean - lemon blueberry pancakes, cinnamon bun pancakes, what more do you want for brunch?

We had to wait to be seated and then had a wait for our food, but our server was nice and the food was yummy. Next time I want to check out the upstairs balcony."
832,"This place was so good, that my fianc√© and I decided to get brunch here 2 days in a row during our recent visit to Portland. There is a wait because the place is extremely small (and quaint/adorable) but it's WELL worth the wait. 

The guy who runs it is not only efficient and organized, but insanely personable and friendly. In fact, all of the staff members we interacted with were extremely friendly- our waiter, our waitress, and another waitress downstairs made us special drinks during our wait!

I got the Tuscan scramble my first time there, and my fianc√© got the Louisiana Benedict. The second visit I got a basic breakfast with 2 eggs, sausage, homefries, and honey wheat toast, my fianc√© got the huevos rancheros, and we split a cinnamon bun pancake. He said he's never had huevos rancheros that delicious. The cinnamon bun pancake was to die for. The homefries are made of 3 potatoes. And are amazing. All of the food was scrumptious and tasted so fresh. We got mimosas, chai lattes, and the rocket fuel coffee with Bailey's and even the drinks were well done!"
833,"Amazing. Delicious food, kind & friendly staff, cozy & unpretentious setting! Pro tip: order from sides section! I got homemade corned beef hash (tender & well-seasoned with more beef than potatoes), greens (simple & fresh field greens with vinegary dressing) & cinnamon roll pancake (kid's size unless you're sharing or have something to prove.) If there's a wait for a table, do it (but position yourself away from the door bc the heater cranks out the hotness.)"
834,"This eatery is consistently serving the best brunch in all of Portland, Maine!
I have been eating here for 20 years, and I have NEVER had a bad meal. 
The food is fresh, innovative, and most of all delicious!! The serving staff is friendly and helpful! The establishment's owner Joe, is welcoming and very hands on; from delivering food orders, to topping off your coffee! Great value for your money! BEST BRUNCH PERIOD!!
Can't wait to go back soon!"
835,"I have come here twice a year for the past three years when I would visit my brother at college in Maine. Now that he has graduated I am DEVASTATED that I do not have an excuse to come here!

Bayside American Cafe has my favorite brunch in all of New England, and of all my US travels. The eggs Benedict is simply sublime. The eggs are always poached to perfection, never too runny, never too cooked. The hollandaise is thick and savory. The English muffin is toasted and a nice crisp counterpart to the soft egg. The homefries are pure potato goodness, seasoned beautifully. The pancakes are fluffy heaven. Truly I could go on. And having been here so many times, I can say that their consistency is on point. The three photos I've included are from three different visits so you can see how consistently amazing the eggs Benedict is. The prices are also very reasonable. 

Is the wait long on the weekends? Sure. Is it worth it. ABSOLUTELY! The servers hustle, the kitchen staff hustles; they try to get everyone served and happy as quickly as they can (but you never ever feel rushed). You can definitely tell that the owner (Joe, I think?) cares deeply about his restaurant. He manages the waitlist, runs around the restaurants, and answers the phone. Every employee is working hard, and in turn, the service is amazing. 

If you are in the Portland area looking to have an amazing brunch experience (and not in too much of a rush), go to Bayside! But be prepared to have higher standards for the rest of your life. :)"
836,"It was well worth the wait. Balance of healthy options and flavor. 

Service was excellent and informative. Loved the veggie egg mixture with the gluten free roll."
837,"LOVE THEIR CINNABON PANCAKE. Great for groups of 4 or 5. Usually a wait on weekend mornings (as expected). Very limited parking... be prepared to search for street spots, that's all that they offer."
838,"Absolutely beautiful, quaint spot with amazing breakfast. Good luck trying to find parking, I usually like to go during the week after 0900 when everyone is already at work. CBD coffee, fresh produce and eclectic menu."
839,"This was such an amazing restaurant, everyone who worked here was so kind and the food was incredible. I'd recommend this to anyone"
840,"One of my favorites for brunch and absolutely worth getting out the door early to avoid the long lines. Last weekend I rushed us out of house at 8.30am to capitalize on the sunny weather and was thrilled to get seated immediately on the patio. On mornings where we've arrived later, it's been an hour or even two hours to wait, so plan ahead. You can grab coffee or water while you wait, which is much appreciated.

The mimosa is a delightful spin on the classic with zesty lime in pretty glassware. We discovered your best bet is to order a single pancake or slice of French toast and add sides if you're craving sweet and savory. I have dreams about the maple bourbon bacon scallion pancake. The home fries pack a flavorful kick, and their breads are made in house. For me, doing the basics right is sometimes the most important.  

If you're visiting on a Saturday morning in May-November, walk on over to the Farmer's Market and balance out that lemon blueberry French toast with some carrots."
841,"Came at a good time in the morning to experience this cozy breakfast joint! Called at about 7.30am to check on the lines. Drive in around 8am. We only had to wait a few minutes which getting great Maine coffee. (When we left, there was a long wait outside in the cold!)

I felt like I was visiting home in this very woodsy, living room house setting. Came for their pancakes, so got one to share, in addition to very chunky, fresh crab cakes with chipotle mayo sauce. 

Our waitor was amazing. He gave us the right tips on food and drive! So grateful for great waitors like him."
842,"The corned beef hash! I could stop the review there and everyone who has ever walked in there for breakfast would start nodding and salivating. Homemade with large chunks of tender corned beef, just the right amount of cooked onion and medium chunky white and sweet potatoes. Add a couple of eggs and a side of homemade white or wheat toast or English muffin...the day is complete. 
This place is usually very busy for a reason...the food is amazing. Choices range from traditional breakfast items like bennies and French toast to pancakes that cover an entire dinner plate. Sandwiches and breakfast burritos, whatever you want, they can probably put it on the plate. They have a bar upstairs and the seating is cozy. A few nice tables overlook Congress. Some seating downstairs also and the kitchen is open concept so you can see where the magic is created. 
A must try for visitors and a destination spot for locals. Open 7-2 daily, the wait can be a little long but the food is worth it."
843,"We only got to be here in Maine for a short week, and this place was so good we came here twice! I had the Louisiana Bayou Benedict both times and my boyfriend tried their Steak Benedict and Corned Beef Hash. We also tried one of their Cinnamon Roll Pancakes and omg, what a treat! Mimosas are on point, or the Spruce Moose was also tasty if you want a different kind of brunch cocktail. 

Not only was everything delicious, but the service was on point as well. The staff was all friendly and welcoming, ready with recommendations. Be prepared to wait for a table, but I assure you it's worth it! If I lived in the area, this would def be a regular haunt for me. Hopefully I can get back there next summer!"
844,"Awesome breakfast spot. Self-serve coffee & tea while we waited to be seated. They also serve drinks from the bar to folks waiting to be seated. I had the coffee-cake pancakes and they were delicious. Mango mimosas were also a big hit at our table. Fantastic, friendly service. Not a single foot wrong in our entire experience. Go here for breakfast in Portland!"
845,I truly love it here and I love what they add to the Portland breakfast scene. Sometimes hit and miss with food but for the most part wonderful American breakfast staples
846,"One word: AMAZING.

Such a great menu and there's literally something for everyone. We waited about 30 minutes, which I think is pretty great especially for the lunch hour rush! 

I had the Maine Crab Cake Benedict and my fianc√© had the Lobster Benedict and we weren't disappointed! It was amazing, the flavors, the freshness, the portions! Everything. 

We also had one cinnamon bun pancake, literally tasted like I was having a cinnamon bun haha.  

Also had mango mimosa, DELICIOUS."
847,"Get there early! There is no space to wait, but they make you feel at home with self service water and coffee downstairs.  The upstairs dining room and bar is no frills, but a breakfast place really doesnt need them.  Lots of kids around, and the staff was very friendly.  

Lobster benedict was rich and warming - the only complaint is that eggs were a bit overcooked and runny.  But hey, if that is the only complaint, it's pretty good!"
848,Delicious! We went on a Friday morning for breakfast and didn't have to wait. A must is the banana blueberry pancake - I mean it it's a must! Our waiter was beyond kind giving us ample suggestions for exploring Portland. The food came out decently quick as well. Great spot when visiting.
849,"There are plenty of places with great food in Portland, and this place definitely has great food. What separates them from the other great diners was the service. I really enjoyed talking with the staff and they were very genuine and nice. Not only were they great at explaining the brunch menu, but they took the time to make sure you got something you were satisfied with."
850,I have been here twice with out of town company and its never disappointed us or them. The food is very tasty and staff are very hospitable. The wait can pretty nuts on Saturday and Sunday (we hear) so we have always avoided peak brunch and have never waited more than 15 minutes. Not normally an issue in summer but it seems the outside waiting area during winter would be miserable. Try the cinnamon roll pancake or a trusty omelet.
851,This place was so good. Each person in my party got something different and it was all amazing. The wait staff was really nice and accomodating as well! Great atmosphere and worth waiting for once you get there!
852,"Researched brunch spots online after seeing the LONG line at Becky's Diner, and found Bayside.  The 45-minute wait was worth it... what a delicious Bloody Mary with a couple prawns and lots of horseradish!! The place is small but the management does their best to make all the folks waiting are taken care of with coffee and drinks."
853,"Highly recommend! 
Well I have my new favorite breakfast spot in Portland! Came in with a somewhat large group (7 people) and were able to hang out around the serve-yourself coffee bar while we waited for our seats. While we were waiting we got to watch the kitchen staff cook while sipping on freshly brewed brew! When we were seated our waitress quickly came by and brought us fresh coffee and water. She was very helpful in menu recommendations and was available if we needed anything. 
I got the blueberry pancake (with real maple syrup) and a side of bacon (ordered crispy). Yum yum yummy yum. The waitress said one pancake would be enough and she was right! I was STUFFED after that one pancake and the bacon. The pancake was a little crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I loved it - but my stepmom wasn't a fan of the crisp on the outside for her pancake. In her opinion it made it too difficult to cut. 
A couple people got the Cajun burger and they both loved it - they both said it was quite spicy tho, so be prepared! 
Excellent feedback on the bennies! The eggs were PERFECTLY poached. They were even perfectly round. They must have some special poaching tool that makes the eggs that beautiful. 
I wish I had something to complain to make this review more balanced but I don't. 
Five stars. Will return."
854,My wife and I found this little Gem Saturday Morning.  Excellent cup of coffee Omelettes were cooked to perfection. Everyone is friendly and the service was fantastic. Definitely worth a try.  Looking forward to our next visit.
855,"Really like that the menu is split up so you can order a couple of different things to try with the rest of your table. After asking the waitress what the best selling items are, we ordered 1 piece of the lemon blueberry french toast, a side of the corned beef hash, 1 cinnamon bun pancake and 2 bacon cheddar maple pancakes. 

There was SO much food, which was fine because we wanted that. But for someone who doesn't want a ton of food, 1 of anything would've been enough. The side of the corned beef hash was a generous portion and the pancakes are huge so one is more than enough. 

Having tried all of these things, my favorite was the corned beef hash. For sweet I think the cinnamon bun pancake because it was different."
856,"Food: delicious! The portion for the pancakes were literally head-sized. Huge. I got the blueberry french toast with their homemade lemon curd on top. So good. I also got the bayside scramble, and that came with yummy chorizo potatoes. I actually inhaled everything. Everything was decently priced. 

Service: friendly, delightful, excellent. 

Tip: we came in around 10:30 and got seated around 11. Not bad of a wait, but if you're trying to find a time to go without waiting, I noticed it was getting quite empty around noon when we left."
857,"I was super bummed they didn't have any lobster or crab available (they claimed to have had a busy weekend) but their alternatives definitely made up for it! I ordered their classic eggs Benedict and it came with home-fries. I think it's one of the best home-fries I've ever had! It seasoned very well, kinda of Cajun style. The eggs Benedict tasted as usual. I also tried the french toast which was super sweet but so good! Perfect for a dessert even. I really regret not trying their cinnamon bun pancake, which looked amazing. 
Although we had a tasty brunch I wished the restaurant/host would have informed us that they were lacking some items on their menu. After waiting an hour, we were really disappointed we weren't going to eat what we came there to eat."
858,"Portland, Maine is the only place in the world where waiting in line is fun.

At Bayside, you're going to have to wait for a table on Sundays for at least 45 minutes.  There's no way around it.  It's one of the best known diners/breakfast places in the area and everyone in Portland, both the hungover and the non-hungover, gather outside the doors of places like this on Sunday mornings.

But this is a fun process because it's Portland and the concept of cynicism still hasn't reached this corner of the country.

In Boston, lines are actually lines.  People stand poised facing the restaurant, as if it might lift up its skirt and run away.  They stand firm in one spot as if every living thing, including small children, those little shits, might try to cut in line.  They're not fucking around.  If you try to cut, you'll be on the menu.

What's a line in Portland?

A group of people just hanging out, approaching other people for a chat, and smiling a lot.  If you passed the restaurant, you wouldn't know there was a line.  Of course, being the undercover Bostonian in the ""line,"" I was going insane.  Every time someone new gave their name to the host and joined the ""line,"" I had this irrational feeling that we were not going to get a spot.

I need to get out of town more.

As it turns out, it was a well-ordered system.  When our turn came, we were called in and seated, within the promised 45 minutes.  From this second on, I experienced the warmest customer service this side of the Atlantic I've ever seen.  The host suggested that I put my suitcase behind his podium so that we'd be comfortable and it wouldn't be in anyone's way.  He assured me no one would touch it.  Having been in Portland for two days and having seen people trust each other like no other place, I knew this already.

I could have left the PIN code to my checking account with him and every cent would still be there when I got back.

After we were seated, the waitress looked so happy to see us, I wondered if we had met her the day before while bar-hopping.  We hadn't.  She was just being friendly.  She gave us enough time to decide before taking our order.  The order took a little longer than I would have liked but it didn't seem out-of-place given the VERY relaxed nature of this amazing town.

Plus, I like when my meal is taking a while because it means that the chef is probably spending time on it.  I prefer that to a meal put together like the Bride of Frankenstein.

The kid who brought us our platters was the most chipper of them all.

""Here you go, sir.  The meat platter,"" he said, grinning, referring to my two extra sides of sausage and bistro steak to go with my Classic Two-Egg Breakfast.  This item consists of two eggs, done any style, home fries, and toast. They encourage you to order sides to go with it.  I needed no encouragement.  I felt so lousy from the night before that I had scribbled my last will and testament on the napkin.  It's not often you find yourself praying for a fatal case of food poisoning.

Unfortunately, when I bit into the food, I was disappointed.

It was very fresh and structurally perfect: The meat had a char, the interior was perfectly cooked, my eggs over easy were runny and firm in the right areas, and the toast and home fries were cooked right as well.  But something about the flavor of every item was off.  

The maple sausages were too sweet.  Yeah, they're maple, but I'd tone down the sweetness a little and replace it with salt.  Salt and sweet go very well together in both savory dishes and dessert.  But they're like the House and the Senate: One should never overpower the other.

The herby flavor on the outside of the steak tasted burned and pungent.  The meat itself was delicious and medium-rare but the pungent flavor on the outside was unappetizing.  I couldn't finish it.  The home fries had no real flavor and the toast was caramelized on one side but not the other.  I would replace that thick slab of bread with a thinner slice, preferably regular white bread, and I'd stick to bright, fresh flavors for the home fries, perhaps some lemon juice.

The egg was the only thing I had no problem with.  But that's a little hard to screw up.  Nevertheless, I'm giving them points for it because I liked the restaurant itself and the people who worked there.

That was the only thing that stopped me from giving this place two stars.  I've met friendly staff before but there was a warmth and camaraderie here that transcended mere friendliness.  The employees of Bayside have the vibe of a person you would call for bail money.  They had the vibe of someone you know will still love you despite seeing you led out in handcuffs.

That attitude was exactly what I needed to chase away fantasies of sticking my vodka-soaked head in the deep fryer to end my pain.  And that attitude is what earns them at least 3.5 stars.  The food is an easy fix and I know they can cross the finish line with a few tweaks."
859,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolute worst dining experience ever. Food took an hour. Owner is rude and clearly incompetent. Place is a shitshow. Server was sweet and appropriately apologetic.
860,"Solid solid breakfast. If you want to avoid a wait, come in before 8am. The previous day I went it at like 8:15 and there was a 45 minute wait. Today I went in at like 7:30 and was seated immediately. 

I had the lobster benedict. I opted to up the homefries to veggie homefries and was glad I did. I ended up with a beautiful plate of colors and flavors as the veggie homefries is really a veggie hash! The benedict was great; The lobster tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. 

For my kids, we got them Maine Blueberry Pancakes and paid the upcharge for 100% Maine Syrup. Because when on vacation and in the region, you eat what the region has to offer. 

The pancakes are huge though. 1 is enough to split with 4 people if ordering an entree. Probably enough for 1 person's breakfast. 

I definitley recommend it and liked the options!"
861,"other than the long wait, the food was amazing. i also got a hot chai latte which was wonderful. If you do come here I suggest making a reservation because the wait time can become quite long"
862,"This place is awesome. As soon as we walked into the doors we were greeted by a very friendly and welcoming host. Even though the wait was longer than we would have liked, they offer coffee ahead of time and water while you are waiting so that was nice. 

Our server was very friendly and complimented us in our food choices. We couldn't decide what to get so my 2 friends and I each got a breakfast meal and then 2 Park cakes to share. Everything was delicious. The pancakes were so fluffy... amazing. The choices are unique as well. I'm plain when it comes to breakfast so I got the basic breakfast. I normally get nervous ordering my eggs over medium because most places cook them over easy... they cooked them to perfection here! The potatoes were great. A good mixture of different kinds of potatoes. My only complaint was the toast was a little too toasted and hard so I wish I would've opted for a different bread choice. All and all, my friends and are were extremely satisfied."
863,"If you're anything like me and hate waiting for food, (or anything really), GET OUT OF BED EARLY FOR THIS PLACE- ITS WORTH IT. I gotta tell ya, 7:15 on a Sunday morning is perfect, within one hour the place was packed. I had the Lobster Frittata and a glass of Rocket Fuel. Very satisfied with both choices. Added smoked bacon to the Frittata, because duh, and there was plenty of lobster in the dish. Rocket Fuel was fantastic, available hot or iced, and is quite sweet-great for me. Can't wait to come back!"
864,"Best breakfast I've had in a really long time! The staff is all incredible! Friendly, helpful and kind! Our waitress, Leigh, was so great! We will definitely be back next time we are in Portland!"
865,"My husband and I had breakfast here this morning during our weekend trip to Portland. We read a bunch of Yelp reviews about the awesome food, saw it was only a 13 minute walk from our hotel, and decided to check it out.

Unfortunately, the reviews do not mention the location of the restaurant is not in a great area. As out of towners, we had no idea about the area of Bayside and did not feel safe during our trek over to the restaurant. We even witnessed a serious crime on the walk back after breakfast (I know, I can't believe it either.) I wanted to post this to let other out of towners know it is better to drive over to the restaurant instead of walking from the Old Port area. Unfortunately the area of Bayside is currently dealing with a large homeless and drug problem, which was very noticeable once we were in the area. 

Sketchy neighborhood aside - the food was amazing and the service was excellent. The crab cake benedict was one of the most delicious breakfast items I've ever had. 

In no way do I want this review to reflect negatively on the restaurant. I just would like to keep other visitors new to the area safe."
866,"Great, friendly place for breakfast! Was here visiting and wanted to try this place out and so happy we did! 

We got the cinnamon bun pancake and make your own wrap and both were great! The cinnamon bun pancake was one of the best! 

We made a Mexican inspired wrap with rice & beans, avocado, the andouille sausage and it had the egg inside! So yummy! Also got an extra side of salsa which was fresh and house made and so good! 

Also had great service and enjoyed the setting of the restaurant in the house. Overall a great breakfast place!"
867,"Great service, delicious breakfast offerings, and nice ambiance. I hade one of the best eggs Benedict's Ive ever tried."
868,"June 15, 2028 

We four decided on brunch and all had an Eggs Benedict style dish. Mine was Cajun with andouille sausage.  

Downside:
I felt the dish had a few glaring faults that made the dish fail. 

One, the sausage parts were a touch skimpy. Instead of being the featured ingredient they felt like an afterthought. Having had Louisiana andouille sausages personally (flown in to my specialty market) I was just...meh. 

They were also over cooked, tough and burnt: either reheated or just forgotten about. 

The second issue for me was the corn cakes they used in place of the ubiquitous English/American muffins. 

They were too sweet for the dish and didn't have enough presence in a textured way to support the eggs which need:
A place to hold the yolk with a texture that actively does the work (in this case the pancake-like rounds just let the egg flow into the plate),
A flavor that complements the egg with out being overbearing. 

Instead they were a bit thicker then matzoh and strangely tough; not like a thing I'd call muffin...and not a cake. Didn't need the Sweet and it just killed the dish for me. I did mention it to my server. 

I'd have preferred to go with lobster or crab, those things being ""mined"" in the state, but MKT pricing brought the prices to about $26ish and that's hard to do sometimes. Otherwise the costs per dish were about half that. 

On the positive side of the ledger, the at home feeling of the decor was fairly pleasant and the staff friendly. Very.

I also enjoyed looking into the kitchen line on the way in while awaiting seating. Very nice and one could see the apparent structure of the layout with ease and the cleanliness. Important to me. 

Importantly, the four of us were well taken care of by our bearded server, Andrew. My father-in-law especially liked his un presuming and  we'll gauged service. 

Not knowing the other wait staff, I'd say you couldn't go wrong with him. I very much agree with my FIL."
869,"I used to frequent Bayside American Cafe often, I was willing to wait in the long line for what always proved to be delicious and unique brunch offerings.  At the time, there was no real competition in the local brunch game.  Over the past few years, with the brunch offerings exploding in this town, I have been out shopping some new places.  

Still, I would drive by BAC when stopping at the post office and would remember the crab-cake Benedict, the cinnamon roll pancake, their excellent coffee and the friendly service, and then, I would remember the consistently long lines and wait time, and sadly drive on.

This past weekend, I decided, it was time for a change.  Time to go back to the Bayside American Cafe, a place I had soooo loved, long wait lines be damned!

Annnddd...I had a wonderful meal.  I even shed a small tear while eating the Bistro steak Benedict.  It was lovely and did feel like coming home again.  I sampled some of my friends Berry pancakes and they were so light and fluffy!  Oh, and the coffee was smooth and plentiful.
On the other hand, I waited 25 minutes for a table.  It did feel, as a complete experience, that things had pretty much remained the same.  Ugh!

I guess I would say that if you are a person who is willing to wait, that you will be rewarded with wonderfully prepared and creative breakfast and brunch options.  On the other hand, if you don't have the time, or are traveling with a large group (over 4 people), you should probably keep walking (it hurt me to say that)."
870,"We were told this cafe has won the best breakfast in Portland, ME award several years in a row. We waited about a half hour for a table on a Saturday morning while there was a festival in town. We sat upstairs. The food was good. Our server initially was very helpful and patient while we decided on what to order. Then after we ordered we didn't see him for almost an hour. Once we were sat the wait died down and only about 50% of the upstairs was occupied. We mentioned to the host who sat us that we had been waiting for 45 minutes and wondered where our food was. Although the food was good the wait to get it was unreasonable for breakfast. Likely a fluke but it was disappointing as we were visiting Portland only for a short time. Our wait here limited the time we could have been enjoying the city."
871,"I've been enjoying Sunday Brunch at this cafe since Natasha 1st opened 20 some years ago.  Some of the menu has changed since then and 1 thing that had remained throughout the years is their ""MOIST DELICIOUS CORNED BEEF HASH!!""

Wish they would reinstate Natasha's Chocolate French Toast.  (Hint hint)

On a recent Monday visit at 11am my Wife and I were quoted a 30 minute wait time which turned out to be closer to an HOUR wait time for a table for 2.

We both enjoy the Corned Beef Hash so much that this time we didn't deny our cravings. 

The staff was WARM & Friendly and our meals were DELICIOUS!!

The price was very reasonable for the quality of product.  I had scrambled eggs w/English Muffin and my wife enjoyed her eggs over easy w/English muffin.  

Upon leaving. I went downstairs to personally COMPLIMENT THE CHEF for preparing such a Delicious Breakfast,  For for a Queen and her King!!

By the way... it's ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT at this cafe!!

Bon Appetit!! 
Perry
PS... PHOTOS FORTHCOMING"
872,"I still call it Bintliffs, but Bayside always has a wait for a reason. The various Benedict's are delightful, but the Corned Beef Hash is my personal favorite. Big chunks of homemade corned beef, 3 potatoes hash. Yes!"
873,"Super small, always a wait, always worth the wait.

Very friendly service, good is great, cocktails are great.

Highly recommend the crabcake benedict and the corned beef hash."
874,I've never used yelp but downloaded it to make this review. Best breakfast I've ever had. A little bit of wait but I expected that on a Sunday honestly. Everything about the breakfast was awesome. I haven't eaten that much food in awhile. Also all the workers were really nice!!
875,"Delicious!! We had the crab cake benedict and the cinnamon bun pancakes. Both were amazing! Long wait, but worth the wait."
876,"Great spot to just roll into for a quick and hearty weekend breakfast-we love the pancakes as well as the French toast! The location is convenient, and the few times we have came in the server we have had has always remembered us and been kind and welcoming. Thanks Bayside American!"
877,Again another place we found on yelp!  Very cozy inside and was pleasantly surprised of the outdoor seating. We were lucky enough to have gotten table outside. Great service and lots of good choices on menu. I will definitely come back next year and recommend to anyone who will be visiting Portland
878,"Bayside is a great place for lunch on the weekends, however, get there early as wait times rack up early and can be extensively long. However, if you survive the wait, the food is worth it. Everything is fresh and hand made, down to the hash and toast. Portions are decently sized and they have a variety of options to select from. Highlights were definitely the omlet and hash. Check it out!"
879,"Went here for lunch on a Thursday and it was still quite busy, so reservations are recommended! 
We split the cinnamon bun pancake and I had the bayside BLT, both were great! The home fries were delicious."
880,Absolutely fantastic!  Been 3 times now and haven't been disappointed.  The Bacon cheddar chive pancake with maple bourbon syrup is a must!  Bloody Mary's are on point and the service has been great.  Quaint and cute little place.  Highly recommended for breakfast.
881,"The BEST breakfast I have had in a very long time, maybe ever. After reading yelp reviews I knew that the earlier we got here the better. We ended up arriving around 9:45 on a Sunday morning and were told that there was about a 30-45 min wait. The inside of the restaurant is very small and and gets full very quickly. There was pretty much no where stand so we waited outside. It was cold out so I appreciated that they had coffee available while you waited. Our total wait time ended up being closer to 1 hour. 

Once we were seated upstairs our server was friendly but could have been more attentive, it seems like we went long periods of time without seeing her. I had the salmon benedict and my husband had the strawberry french toast. Both were delicious. After seeing the cinnamon bun pancake we also had to order one of those as well. That was one of the best things I have ever tasted. That pancake is available in stack of 1, 2, or 3. The pancake is huge and rich so 1 is definitely plenty but it tastes so good that I can easily see how someone could easily go through 2 or 3.

The next time I am in Portland, I will be back here for sure and I will make sure that I get there earlier next time!"
882,"What an adorable place! Stopped by for brunch after it came highly recommended by the woman at the front desk of the hotel I was staying at and they did not disappoint.

The cocktail menu was awesome and my drink came in a beautiful glass. I also loved how many different egg options they had - so many different eggs benedicts! I got the vegetable eggs benedict and the vegetables were cooked perfectly (the eggs too!).

The wait wasn't that long on a Friday though I could see it being longer on the weekends. Wishing this place was closer to home."
883,"I remember when this place was Bintliff's, and the line to get in for Sunday brunch was halfway around the block. I was recently working across the street, and asked Google for a lunch place within walking distance... Oh yeah, I forgot about that place! I remember it being a bit pricey, and crowded. On this late Monday morning, there was plenty of seating. The greeter and server were very friendly, and the atmosphere was relaxed and quiet. Apparently, the mimosas are the thing to order, but I had to go back to work, so I was unable to try one. They looked great, though. Lots to choose from on the menu, and I settled on the fritatta with lobster. It was really delicious. I stayed a while, since my next appointment was about 45 minutes after I sat down, and was told I could stay as long as I needed to, even after people started filling in the seats. It still is a somewhat expensive choice for brunch in the Bayside area, but I'll be going back!"
884,"Small and always a painful wait but so worth it. The neighborhood is quite sketchy and parking is sometimes scarce but the wait is part of the experience at this cafe. They give you the option to make your own coffee while you wait plus theres also a tiny bar upstairs where you can order adult bevies. They have an adorable outside seating area perfect for summer brunches. Their menu is executed graciously, lots of traditional brunch options. I personally love their Bistro Steak Benedict, A+++ on the quality of meat and craftsmanship of the dish."
885,"Best breakfast spot of all time. Great food, super fresh. The staff is friendly and the selection is awesome."
886,The wait was long (granted it was a Sunday morning) but the wait was so worth it. The food is amazing. I got the lobster eggs Benedict and I definitely recommend that! My husband got pancakes (cinnamon roll and peanut butter and chocolate chip) and he said those were amazing. Definitely a must try if you are in the Portland area.
887,"Tried to go here one time a while back but the wait was 1hr+ ... I can't wait that long for my brunch! So finally when we came here the last time they estimated us at a 45 minute wait - for me is that a long time? Yes... but I'm also usually very hungry come brunch so take it as you want... 

There's not many seats to sit in while waiting so you're all squished into the downstairs like sardines, there are also I think 4 tables down there which I think would be awkward to sit there because while you're eating there's literally probably 15+ people waiting around your table. Sit upstairs if you have the choice... while you wait there's self service coffee and water.

The staff was very friendly and once we were seated the food came out rather quickly. It was yummy and filling!"
888,"This place was recommended by our Airbnb host. It's so cozy and comforting inside here, and feels like home. They had a lot of eggs Benedict's to choose from, I got the Louisiana Benedict. so good, The corn cakes were amazing! Mulled cider was delicious as well."
889,"Wow, this food AND service was excellent!
Coming in as an outer-towner, from NY, I was pleasantly surprised. Like all the other reviews stated, if you are coming in after 8, you will be waiting... well worth the wait! We got the lobster Benedict and the crab cakes Benedict (with cajun hollandaise sauce). The crab cakes definitely won. 

Another thing we enjoyed was the service provided by our server, Andrew. He was awesome. Gave us great reviews foe things to do on top of the great food recommendations (gave the recommendation for the crab cake WITH hollandaise sauce). He even took the time out to write out what we would enjoy in the area with bar crawling tips.
A+ service!!"
890,"Outstanding !  this restaurant you need to have patience as it's worth the wait.. 
I thought the holiday sauce definitely needed something but the food was excellent here. Service was very good 
3 line cooks with a very small kitchen.
I tipped the cooks as they did a great job . Came back the next day ..
Don't be in a RUSH enjoy the experience"
891,Great food and wait staff was great as well. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict was some of the best I've had! Reasonable prices. Family friendly. Love that the place is small and quaint.
892,"This is a stunningly good place for breakfast in Portland. Great food, great staff, reasonablw prices. Will be back!"
893,"Had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated. Overall experience was pretty good. 

Our server was very attentive and very nice. We ordered a few Benedict, and the corn beef hash. My vegetable Benedict was amazing, oh and the potatoes are out of the world. Best home fries I ever had. 

My sisters ordered the French toast and were pleased. One thing is they ran out of lobsters and crab . Would be back if in the area in the future."
894,"Amazing amazing amazing from service to food to ambience. We ordered and shared the huevos rancheros and was delicious. I'd highly recommend this breakfast place while in Portland, ME."
895,"We came here Saturday for the last meal of our trip. We expected to wait awhile to be seated, but we did not expect it to take 45 or so minutes between ordering and receiving our food. The server was nice, but she didn't tell us she would check on the food or apologize for the wait. Then the people at the two tables who arrived after us got their food in a reasonable time... seems to me something went wrong in the kitchen but no one bothered to update us.

As far as the food, it was NYC prices, and was pretty good. The cinnamon bun pancake to share was the best plate. The root hash was tasty, but could have used some sour cream or something to take away the dryness, and it would have been nice if the huevos rancheros came with potatoes. The drinks were decent too, and there was street parking available."
896,Delicious food!  Service was amazing and I shared lots of laughter with my server.
897,"GO EARLY! Unless you want to wait a really long time (worth the wait though). The owner is such a friendly guy who was helpful and patient with customers clogging up the entry way to wait for a table. Very cute indoors, downstairs and upstairs. The food was amazing. Got eggs Benedict, and a cinnamon roll pancake. If you love something sweet, I suggest that pancake. The pancake is huge though!!! The service was amazing. Everyone seemed to get along great and have a routine down. Definitely want to go back to this place!"
898,"I'll start by saying this place is not worth your time. Was really looking forward to trying this place out. Had come to Portland a couple times and tried to but the line was too long. 
Finally we decided to give it a try today and put our name in. Guy with the notepad said about an hour. Around an hour and a half in when we checked with him he had skipped us. He apparently couldn't even read his own handwriting. 
He gave us the next table, we sat down and ordered. They were out of the item I walked in looking for. 
25 min after we had put our order in, our food hadn't arrived. 
Skip it  your time is more valuable than their overpriced items."
899,"Long wait, free coffee while you wait. Waited 1 hour on a Saturday morning in September. Decent food, limited gluten free options but doable. Great service. Nice ambience we sat outside on the back patio. Average prices. If you have time it's a worthy experience."
900,"A small, Mainer part of me wants to poo-poo Becky's for being overrated or being a tourist trap.  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?!?!

Becky's lives up to the hype.  With extremely reasonable prices, moderately large portions, friendly service, and great diner food - Becky's is everything that you could want!

Go straight for the homemade hash.  Do not pass go.  Get a grilled muffin as a starter. 

10/10 recommend (except on touristy weekend mornings - then avoid like the plague unless you want to rub elbows with Massholes)."
901,"Becky's dinner combines the charm of an old dinner with the seaside vibe of a northeast seafood restaurant. It's located on Hobson's wharf in Portand, Maine. 

Their menu features breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Dinner starts at 4. I had lunch and definitely enjoyed my crab and Swiss melt. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the crab in the melt wasn't warm. The sandwich was awesome like that, so it's basically a must win. Also...the sandwich is market price, so the crab is obviously fresh. It only cost $11 for the meal.

The place isn't that large and given the location, I would imagine it's busy during prime times given that its ranked as one of the top diners in New England."
902,"This place was recommended by the front desk at our hotel when we asked for a breakfast restaurant nearby.  It was about a 10 minute walk on a cold Saturday morning. When we arrived, there was a warm vestibule to stand out of the cold while we waited for our table.

It is a busy place and highly regarded in the neighborhood for good reason. They open at 4 am regardless of the weather so the local workers can get a good breakfast.
 
We were seated at the counter, greeted warmly by our waitress and immediately offered coffee.  She and all of the staff were smiling, friendly and made our visit a  delight.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich with home fries. The English muffin was fresh and delicious and the home fries were plentiful.

We will definitely be visiting again.  So worth the walk from any of the local hotels."
903,"5 stars go out to this little diner that kicks out some mean breakfast with unique items and daily specials. I could go on about how good it was but trust me, if in downtown Portland Maine it's a must to try and I hope you will have as good of an experience as we did."
904,"All I have to say is WOW, why have I not been here yet until now!? We waited about 20 minutes for a table on a Sunday morning. Totally reasonable/totally worth it! 
Our server was very friendly, patient, the place is obviously always busy but no one seemed like they were frantically running around. 
I had the buttermilk pancakes, and a side of home fries. My boyfriend ordered the Warf special-which basically consisted of four different plates of breakfast foods-French toast on French bread (umm, yum!) corn beef hash, scrambled eggs, an English muffin, and more home fries. Both were delicious. We both left with your stomachs full, wishing we could have eaten more as our plates were far from empty, and came home and took naps! That's when you know it's a good breakfast! 
I can't wait to come back for lunch-Becky's is worth the wait."
905,"If you're looking for a classic Maine diner, Becky's is it. From the locals with great Maine accents who are clearly regular attendees to the lobsters sitting in their tanks across from the kitchen window, it's hard to beat the vibe of this Portland staple.

I came in with a few friends the other day and got your typical diner breakfast. Bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast, and bottomless coffee in a thick Becky's mug that makes even the dreariest of January days seem bearable. We got an order of buttermilk pancakes to share at the table and I recommend always looking at the specials board to see if they're doing any unique pancakes because they do NOT disappoint. 

Expect a bit of a wait, especially if you're coming on the weekend. But once you get your hands around the warm ceramic mug, it'll be worth it."
906,"Becky with the good hair!

We were staying at the Marriott Hotel located in close proximity to Becky's. All our friends suggested Becky's for breakfast and lunch. The lobster roll came highly recommended because of the amount of lobster the roll is loaded up with here!

I knew from the reviews that Becky's generally has a long wait so I ordered a lobster roll to go with the butter on the side (no mayo). It was ready to be picked up in about 15-20 minutes. The cost was market price ~ $23 + tax. It came with french fries and coleslaw. 

The lobster roll was hot and it was very tasty. If I come back to Portland, I'd love to try the a lobster roll from here cold with mayo made the classic way. It's definitely worth ordering a lobster roll from here with the amount of lobster you are presented with. If I wasn't watching my sugar intake, I would have tried the delicious, giant looking molasses cookie cream cheese sandwiches too!"
907,"My wife and I just completed this true, breakfast dining experience.  It is Patriot's Day so the place was packed with a constant waiting list.  We sat at the counter and received outstanding service.  Both of us selected the Hobson Wharf Specials and everything tasted top notch.  What a special, unexpected treat.  We will definitely visit again during our next trip to Portland."
908,"We met some locals who told us this diner was their favorite place for Lobster Rolls. It has the authentic feel of a genuine diner with a solid reputation from years of serving high quality food.

While waiting for our name to be called, we met people who make a special trip into Portland every year just to eat at Becky's Diner. One person told us we had to try the haddock chowder. I asked her for recommendations of other favorite local restaurants. She said she didn't have any other favorites. Haha!

My friend and I each ordered a lobster roll with the mayo and butter on the side. It's served with coke slaw and French fries. We each ordered a cup of the haddock chowder (yes, it was fantastic!) and a order of fried clams to share. 

The lobster roll was pretty awesome. The only thing that wasn't great was the iced tea my friend ordered. I live in North Carolina where great iced tea is an expectation! 

The desserts looked really good too, but we were too stuffed to even think of trying any!"
909,Hey what's not to love about Becky's? It's an authentic dining experience on the Portland waterfront. Great extensive diner menu with tourist tier prices. And the service was super friendly.
910,Had a burger but it was okey. Maybe have to give it a second chance. Although the coconut lime cake was delicious!!
911,"Visited Becky's Diner in Portland on our way home from Acadia. Overall I was a bit let down of the dining experience, most likely its because I had been having lobster for days while at Acadia and was probably having a bit of a lobster fatigue haha.

It was quite a long wait when we arrived around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. Parking was a bit of a hassle after circling around Commerical street finally got lucky and parked at one of the few spots right in front of the building, definitely a very popular restaurant.

After about 15-20 minute wait we got a seat on the upper level which were quite empty only another table occupied other than ourselves. I guess they only open this area up when it gets very busy. I thought it was very nice though as it was quite quiet and second floor has its own bathrooms as well. Plus our server was quite friendly and pretty attentive given how empty it is up here. Not quite the diner atmosphere I was expecting indeed.

Unfortunately I was a little let down of the food. The chowder is a very big bowl portion but felt a bit bland and watered down. The Swiss melt feels mostly cheese and not quite balanced with crab meats. The lobster roll was definitely the better of the meal, the lobsters was quite fresh and delicious but honestly it fell short of what I've had all week while in Acadia. 

Overall a pleasant experience but the food was a bit let down. I hope the next time I visit the area can try out more of their breakfast menu items."
912,"This is for sure the local diner. I'm sure some tourists flow in as well but seems to be the former. I went for an early solo dinner and it was right before the dinner crowd hit. The staff in front were too busy not paying attention to the door and I was standing there way longer than necessary to be seated. A guy finally greeted me and asked if I'd mind sitting at the counter (which was fine for me). 

There were a few people working the counter and taking care of diners around the room as well but it again took at least 5 mins before my server appeared. During this time, several servers were right in front of my face since I sat in front of their POS system. Not one greeted me or said someone would be with me. Is that so hard?? 

A server finally came over and I placed my order with her. I forget her name but it seems she is the only person there who cares / isn't busy being aloof.  

I ordered the haddock chowder and lobster omelet (comes with fries for dinner instead of home fries). I was able to select the cheese (got Swiss of course). Both were decent and I was stuffed before I could finish everything. 

Would I come back? Absolutely not. The staff (except my server) are not team players..its clearly a vibe of: if it's not my table, I'm not interacting with them (at best).  Ignorant to prejudiced of minorities at worst."
913,"Becky's Diner was recommended by a friend who went last year and it did not disappoint! My kids had typical ""diner fare"" (brinner) but I believe in the ""when in Rome"" theory.  

Instead of a lobster dinner (I saw a bunch, and they looked awesome!!), I opted for the lobster omelette.  OH BOY!  If you like lobster...do NOT miss this.  The huge chunks of lobster can't be beat!"
914,"Had an excellent experience today at Becky's Diner. It was very busy but we were seated after 10-15 min at the counter (which we love ). 

I was hungry and ordered too much! I tried the seafood chowder, which was yummy but I suggest you get a cup. 

I ordered a side of fried whole belly clams - they were cooked to perfection. So much so they were still delicious as leftovers on the plane! 

I got the lobster roll and my husband ordered breakfast with the homemade cornbeef hash. 

We then ordered haddock reubens to go - to eat as dinner... they separated the dressing and sauerkraut so it didn't get soggy. 

Popped the sandwiches in the toaster oven and it's still great... can't wait to come back to Portland to play again!"
915,"I grew up going to Becky's and it is by far the best diner. They serve all of Maine's best and more... with breakfast and lunch options that so so good. Lower floor and upper outdoor area, waitresses are always wonderful and so nice! They make their own cakes to, so make sure you grab a slice on the way in or out!"
916,"Classic diner done well.

Want to sit down at a cool-to-the-touch Formica tabletop?  Have a selection of eggs, toast, bacon and the like?  You prefer for breakfast simple with no muss or fuss?  Becky's is it!

With cheap prices and delicious breakfast it is easy to see why Becky's is so popular.  Service is always friendly, food is always good.  I love a basic eggs, toast, ham and potatoes breakfast every once in a while and Becky's always delivers.  There is also a lobster tank, which if you have small children, is a huge plus!  There is often a wait to sit down and I think this must be due to the proximity to the old port and all the hotels there more so than the completely amazing food (as stated it is very relatively classic diner-fare).  That being said, I've often encountered lots of residents dinning- because really resident or visitor, everyone needs a solidly good classic breakfast every now and again."
917,"Becky's tends to be my easy access (relatively speaking), breakfast all day, and great seafood go-to. The servings are smaller than I like for breakfast, but I can eat a lot of breakfast. I'd even say smaller than comparable breakfast spots downtown. There is usually a wait, unless your okay with sitting at the counter. They recently started using handheld buzzers to alert you when your table is ready which is nice. The place is huge so the wait isn't usually very long. There is some parking but it's hit or miss."
918,"Very classic diner feel that serves great American fare with a Maine twist. My family and I came here before we had to head out to the airport and it was a great meal.

I got the fried haddock and it was pretty good. It had a crispy skin yet the fish was tender. The portion was also pretty large.

We also got the lobster roll, clam chowder, fish chowder, and lobster omelette. The fish chowder was a bit bland for me, but everything else we had was great and delicious."
919,"3.5 stars. I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed the lobster roll with butter and also the BLT with lobster club sandwich. Both are good and solid sandwiches, nothing different from other ones I've had. The service was friendly, and the interior is a classic diner. The wait line can be long - a couple of times we didnt even bother waiting. I would come back during off hours or by myself to sit at the bar."
920,"Arrive early or you might need to wait.  Why not wait anyway?  It'll be worth it.  

Hearty breakfasts with generous portions.  

I chose the special which was a Cajun bowl; hash browns, andouille sausage, scrambled egg, avocado... just perfect.  Amazing flavor and textures left me ready to take on the day.  

Absolutely loved it here.  Busy but well staffed with a lovely warm vibe, even on a dreary wet and cold Saturday morning. 

Recommended."
921,Awesome big diner in Portland! The blueberry pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries were GREAT! My fianc√© got hash and eggs & LOVED it! I can picture this as a stop on a presidential campaign. And they are SO FRIENDLY!!
922,"I wish there were more than 5 stars. This place steals the show. From the outside, this place looks like it's stood the test of time, a true statement of a good diner. Inside, the place was bustling for a Wednesday night during off season. Littered with locals from what I could tell. The service here was impeccable. Our waitress was fast and attentive the entire night.

The menu screams classic diner food, with breakfast served all day, sandwiches, burgers and a lot more. My wife raved about the coffee. We started by ordering off the specials menu...seared seafood cakes with homemade remoulade sauce. Two perfect cakes, packed with an assortment of seafood chunks. These didn't last long. 

I didn't come all the way from Nashville to not satisfy my desire for a lobster roll. Oh my goodness. It took me 15-20 minutes to eat this roll, not because of it's enormous size, but because I was savoring every bite. The bun is toasted perfectly. HUGE lobster pieces, accompanied by ""the hybrid"" (half mayonnaise and butter). The only time I've had a better lobster roll is from Red's Eats, and as I write this, I question whether it was better or not. The fries and slaw are also good, but dwarfed by the deliciousness of the roll. 

We finished up with a slice of blueberry cake with white cream cheese frosting from the dessert case. I had a feeling that after everything, this wouldn't disappoint. The cake a mix of blueberries and white cake, moist and full of flavor. Perfect ratio of cake and icing. 

I haven't been this happy with a meal in a while. Hats off to Miss Becky and the crew here. Y'all are awesome!"
923,"We were recommended this place by a few locals, so I was certain it'd be a great dinner option. Unfortunately, Becky's fell short. I would take responsibility for making poor dinner choices, but have since learned my lesson -- NEVER order scallops from a diner. 

Stick to the sandwiches and burgers and maybe cake and you'll walk out happy. My friend polished off his crab melt in minutes. The waffle fries I had as a side were honestly some of the best I've had--well-seasoned, and crisp throughout. The blueberry cake was like a frosted blueberry muffin and looked beautiful. 

Everything else was mediocre. Again, it was my mistake to order scallops at a diner. The texture just seemed off--soft, squishy, bland, as if they'd been previously frozen--bleh. As part of the daily special, the scallops came with breading. I'd admit the breading had an interesting and palatable combination of sweet and salty that was pretty addicting. But overall, it was just too heavy and I would wager that the breading was thrown on to mask the poor quality of the scallops.

Their famous clam cakes were just as disappointing. These are really mis-labeled. There was hardly any clam in these, beyond a few specks of something whose chewy texture was akin to that of clam. Rather, these should really be marketed as breading with a hint of clam because that was what these were. I fail to see what makes these clam cakes famous and I'd urge you not to fall for the same trap.

Again, if it's late and you want a sandwich and few other options are available, I'd go to Becky's. Otherwise, I guarantee there are better places to spend your calories!"
924,"Great family Diner!, Visited from out of town with family of 4 and a 2 year old, they were helpful accommodating and fast.

Food: ordered Fried clam dinner and they were awesome. Hot and perfect. Wife had Tuna club and it was a huge triple Decker feast.

This place was packed and standing room only for lunch. A true must go to in Maine. Lobster roll was to die for! Haddock was fresh and fried perfect

Negative: Need to expand and open up second floor!"
925,"This is a diner that has that hometown feel. Plenty of seating but there seems to always be a line out the door - even on a Monday late morning. Typical breakfast fare - omelette, pancakes, French toast, etc - with some Portland flare added (I.e. the lobster omelet). Great service and quick order to eating turnaround."
926,"Classic, much-loved diner on the water right by the Portland Shipyard and Yacht service. We dined early St. Patrick's Day & really loved the 'Irish' Benedict, two perfectly poached eggs over homemade corned beef hash, smothered with Hollandaise, side of the best home fries. Good coffee, great service! Others enjoyed Bailey's french toast & another with ham & cheese bagel. This is the diner you hope for when traveling!"
927,"Tremendous! We're from out of town. Felt right at home! The staff was great. My omelet was huge and I didn't think I could finish it, but I did because it was THAT good! 

Must go if in Portland."
928,"This was our first stop in Portland and was a great intro! We stopped here for lunch and immediately loved the vibe we almost instantly knew we could expect some tasty diner food and have a great lunch. My boyfriend had a hamburger club on rye and was very happy with it it was a fresh and hearty  lunch. I wasn't super hungry so I got the small bowl of clam chowder and some sweet potato fries, the chowder was definitely not small which I appreciated because it was delicious and the fries were nice and crispy too, just what I look for in sweet potato fries. It was a very good lunch and start to our Portland experience!"
929,"It doesn't get much better than Becky's Diner... every city has that one go to place and Becky's is it. I lived two blocks up the hill on York Avenue and the smells would waft up to my apartment. 

Coffee: and endless cup. 

Eggs: any way you want them. 

Incredible sides and dishes. No negatives. Parking is whackado... or was whackado."
930,It was a 20 minute wait. I can see why. They have the most delicious breakfast. I ordered the works included pancakes choice of meat toast and eggs. I was with my family and had a chance to try a bowl of clam chowder my brother ordered. That was the real deal..lots of flavor and creamy and thick. A must try. They charge your extra for real maple syrup. But the pancakes were delicious. I think it's a wonderful place for breakfast.
931,"Becky's diner was fantastic! Brunch food at a great value and the place is open around the clock. We went around 930 am and still had a 20 minute wait but it was worth it. I got the lobster roll which was jam packed with lobster for around 20 bucks (and a nice portion) and we also got the eggs and English muffin, tomato, and hashbrowns for $4.95. This place is a winner!"
932,Awesome prices awesome service awesome food I had fried shrimp with coleslaw and fries was amazing not greasy. Garden salad was large and fresh and crisp. Fish chowder was excellent. I saw a lobster roll it looked great so that's tomorrow. The service was fast and friendly and attentive highly recommend it.
933,"Nothin finah, bub!

There's not much to say about Becky's that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep it short. 

TO KNOW: 
-expect a wait. Busy always. 
-one bathroom for women, one for men. Use your own Whizz Palace before coming here if you are a frequent peer. 
-it's a local place and sort of grungy which makes it GREAT. 
-parking is a nightmare. Walk if you can. 

Also:
-GOOD MOZZARELLA STICKS. 
-fresh pies and pastries. 
-friendly service, though they may forget specifics of your order. They'll get them for you though. 
-the lobster roll is apparently good.
-their salads are not super great. 
-their breakfast food is served in MASSIVE SERVING SIZES, as it should be. 

It's a true Maine experience. Good, bad, or ugly, it's worth coming here when you're hungover and need both French toast and fried cheese with a Bissell and a Diet Coke."
934,"A fantastic diner. My brother took me here during my limited visit to Portland and I can see why he recommended it so much. 

This is a pretty big diner and they offer a lot of variety on their menu. What they have that I don't see much in New York is the seafood options they have and in particular the Lobster Rolls I was really looking forward to. They also have the classic ""Whoopie"" pies you can't find in normal NYC diners and they have some local Portland hot sauces.

The food here is great and mouth watering. The Lobster in my roll was fresh and tasted great with the butter they pair with it. Though its a little expensive they give you a good portion of french fries to go with it.

The atmosphere here is really chill and nice though its a bit crowded. You can expect to wait 10-15 minutes for just two people and it can be quite loud inside. The staff here is very friendly and they like to talk to tourists about the area of old port. 

Overall this is a fantastic spot for both locals and tourists. I highly recommend this place to visitors."
935,Awesome breakfast! We tried a little of everything. Steak and eggs: steak was cooked perfectly. We tried a side of corned beef hash. It was ok. A little dry and lacking in flavor. We also tried the blueberry pancakes and homefrys. The pancakes were to die for. They were light and fluffy and loaded with blueberries. The homefrys were also really good. I felt they were a little lacking in seasoning; but they were well cooked and had a nice crisp outside. We will come back again for sure!
936,"I'd say 3.5 stars. Becky's was recommended by a friend, who is the daughter of a waitress that worked here 20 years ago. I had to give it a try.

On a positive note, the diner is the real McCoy, and completely authentic. It's large, so can accommodate a lot of people, though if you miss that early-bird Sunday brunch window, which is some magical time between 11 and 11:30am, you'll end up waiting 20 minutes.

Clam chowder is SUPER creamy, and uniquely delish! I ordered a large bowl for the table, and it was devoured in minutes. It was the one standout of the entire meal.

The rest of the breakfast was ok. Pretty average. You have to pay extra for real maple syrup, or you're stuck with that high-fructose corn syrup crap. It's annoying, because what you do pay for is essentially a small tequila shot of maple syrup. Pancakes are otherwise pretty average.

I had the recommended special of lobster eggs Benedict, which was about as special as canned tuna. The hollandaise sauce they use tastes like bottom-shelf, which completely takes away from any lobster joy you look forward to. Nah. Just stick with regular Benedict (unless you have to pay extra for ""real"" hollandaise sauce too).

The service is great though. Several staff came by to check on our table, and they were the sweetest darlings. I'd come back for the service alone. I'm willing to give this place another shot, but only to see if I'll have better luck with other dishes."
937,Got seats at the counter with just a short wait.  Attentive waitress.  Great blueberry French toast
938,"This is an institution in Portland so if you're planning on brunch you should prepare yourself for a wait It's not unusual on a Sunday morning to stand around for 45 minutes awaiting a table, or spot at the bar. 
. Unlike some big cities, the spot opens early. They're busy but friendly and offer a nice mix of breakfast options.  Your omelette may be less cheesy then you're used to but all the ingredients are fresh and the food comes quickly."
939,This was my first stop on my visit to Portland. Cozy little diner with an attentive staff. Breakfast was awesome!
940,"This was one of two places for breakfast that was recommended by hotel staff. I'm glad we choose this one!
We got there on Sunday morning around 815AM and there was already a line out the door. We were asked if we wished to eat inside or upstairs on the, ""porch."" We said whichever was fastest and were told we could sit on the porch right away. Sweet! There was nobody up there! It was odd being that there was nothing wrong with it. In fact the two waitresses were lighting two propane heaters. It was a little chilly but with the heaters in a few minutes I was very comfortable. More and more people started filtering in but we were the first table. 
I had seen pics of the lobster and swiss omelette. It looked so good that my wife and I both got it. It was delicious!!! 
Ever have an omelette where there is hardly any filling? Well this WAS NOT one of those! In fact there was more lobster than egg! 
Hands down the most delicious lobster omelette I ever had. 
The side of corned beef hash was really good too as was their coffee.
I'd come back!!"
941,"I am visiting from out of town (San Antonio,TX). I was super excited to have good ol Maine lobsta! Me and my friend came here out of recommendation and boy did they deliver!  I started with their bowl of chowder soup which was loaded with haddock fish and had an amazing fresh taste to it super good. I then had the lobster roll and think I went to heaven and back just what I was looking for"
942,"By far one of the friendliest places I've ever been! Every time I go, I swear no matter when or where you look there is a smile looking back at you! Service alone is phenomenal. The good is delicious homely and yet to try something I haven't liked."
943,"Friendly peeps, prepare to wait, this place is popular for a good reason, good grub at a good price."
944,"Becky's was recommended by a friend who lives in Portland, Maine. Two Uber drivers also mentioned it was a good place to get drunk food. After a meal, I've come to the conclusion that it's a favorite of locals - someplace homey but nothing special. 

I got a Greek salad with lobster (no mayo) and a fried clam cake. The salad was large and the lettuce was crisp but the lobster portion was small and for $16 I could have just gotten a lobster roll from across the street. The lobster was also not brushed with butter or seasoned in anyway. The clam cake was thin and so battered that it just tasted like fried breadcrumbs. But for $3 bucks I can't say much about it. 

We also had a 20 minute wait and sat outside since there was no seating inside. The 2nd level seating was nice and in the shade but it was a hot day so it would have been nice to have had the option to sit inside. 

Becky's is fine and does the job but it's nothing to rave about."
945,"Coffee is pretty darn good, a little hard to sip sometimes. Love all the servers! Big fan of their bacon hehe and that Italian toast is awesome! Eggs can be a bit greasy but hey it's a diner! Love sitting at the counter but booths are fun with a friend!"
946,"At 6:45 on a Friday night, Becky's was packed and busy. We were lucky that the staff were fast and attentive, because we were seated in a booth after waiting less than 15 minutes. Our food was also served quickly despite the diner being crowded. 

I ordered two blueberry pancakes which came with whipped butter. They were spongy, toasty on the outside, and filled with copious amounts of plump blueberries. The huge pancakes went wonderfully with a few strips of fatty bacon. 

Aside from the food, I especially appreciated the casual, cozy atmosphere. Becky's has the typical, homey, bustling feel that makes diners like this classic. There's nothing better than breakfast for dinner, and Becky's is an excellent place to gorge on affordable comfort food with friends."
947,"A down home diner with down-home cooking and down to earth people. This is something that's hard to get an a multicultural major city. It was a treat dining at Becky's diner. Yes, since it was the weekend, there was a wait for breakfast but I was able to get a spot at the bar since it was just me. The service is great and so is the food."
948,"We vacationed in Portland and went to Becky's twice. The food was delicious both times and the service superior. The banana cream pie was amazing! Dishes we enjoyed were breakfast steak, fish and chips, double cheeseburger, BLT, and breakfast special with home fries and blueberry pancakes."
949,Just get the damn peanut butter brownie.  They are at the counter.  You WILL thank me.
950,It's stop while in town! We meant to come for breakfast but with traffic didn't make it until 11 and their was so many amazing lunch options we got lunch instead. Their crab melt was full of meat and their clams were amazing! They have also daily soups that went perfect with any seafood dish.
951,Nice little diner with the fastest service I've ever experienced. Food was hot and met our expectations. The only reason I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 was that they had a special of blueberry French toast which I was really looking forward to and when I ordered it they said they ran out. If you run out of something couldn't you just erase it from the whiteboard? Pretty disappointed with that.
952,"Ok so I was never at the ""old"" Becky's diner before the remodel but seeing this in person and scratching it off my Portland bucket list--I'm impressed! 

I love diners and this diner is right up top with my first pick of Blue Colony in Newtown CT. Their Crab Melt here? OMG! You gotta try it! I was just the happiest girl in Portland when I came here because yes my name IS Becky and it's not often you find anything with my name on it---unless it has to do with Beyonc√© or Plies! ‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç

I even asked our waitress if I get a discount on anything because my name is Becky...and she said no lol!

Ps: Kudos to the staff @ Becky's...my son was having the meltdown from hell and I told them we couldn't stay to eat. They packed all our food up w/smiles and that all alone I tipped the waitress 50%. I NEVER do that. Once we move to Portland i will be a regular!"
953,"- prices are a bit much and the seating is pretty limited.
- but the food is amazing and the portion sizes are amazing.
- not that much parking, though.
- the staff is always crazy busy, either with eachother or other customers which is okay.
- I wish they had better bathrooms though; not very clean, and also they're way too small and there's not enough considering the ammount of customers they get."
954,"Since moving to Maine 3 yrs ago, Becky's has become a favorite. However, last night our experience was less than stellar. I researched how to contact the owner directly via email; but, the website and the FB page both do not contain a direct message option. I feel badly posting this publicly, but after calling three times today in hopes of speaking to the owner (or at least a manager) and getting hung up on or disconnected, I want the owner to know about our experience. We were a party of 5 at 7 pm yesterday. Our server was prompt and took an interest in our table (I think his name was Jared). Our issues were with some of the food items, not the service - even though our server did not seem to know how to properly address our concerns. Our dinners were served in stages. Side dishes were served before entrees, each of our entrees were served separately, several minutes apart, and we were unable to eat as a family. My fries were served well ahead of my meal. I ordered a side of gravy to go with my fries and it was served lukewarm. I had to send it back twice because the kitchen continued to send out warm-ish gravy. My daughter's mashed potatoes wee cold, but she was so hungry, she ate them anyway (getting the attention of our server and sending stuff back seemed to take a while). The first bite of my stuffed scallops were delicious, although a bit sandy. My second bite was actually cold (cold, sandy, stuffed scallops are not appetizing, trust me!). As our server was taking our cold food items from the table, I looked down and noticed a big black curly hair wrapped around a piece of my 5 year old's broccoli. The kitchen eventually reheated my dinner and the second time it was served, it was piping hot. But, at this point, the shrimp in the stuffing were rendered inedible and the scallops were like rubberbands. I also bit into sand with each bite. I literally paid for, and did not eat, a stuffed scallop dinner. We laughed off our bad luck and assured Jared it was not his fault, but I will admit we were a bit surprised that no manager visited our table and we did not receive an apology. We did not ask for anything to be comped - and no offers were made. Don't get me wrong, MOST of our food was good - our overall experience was not."
955,"We've had breakfast at BECKYS many times while staying in Portland and are never disappointed. Really more of a 4.5 star rated breakfast! Service is always on point and friendly. Coffee is just ok but waitresses are always on top of refills!
Eggs are always cooked to perfection, delicious omelets and fabulous Maine blueberry pancakes( I always order a side of one!) a breakfast spot could win me over with  home fries and although slightly under seasoned, BECKYS are perfectly crisped!!
English muffins are grilled and my husband wasn't a fan but rye toast was a delicious swirled option!
Though tucked at the far end of Commercial Street, it's well worth the short walk for a well prepared reasonably priced local option!!"
956,"Good. Lobster roll. It is a diner. Fast service. Big lobster roll. More costly than expected but bought in high season. Still extremely delicious. Fantastic mashed cauliflower!! Diner atmosphere. Line outside the door - in the rain. Worth eating there!

If not for the lobster rolls, go for the extensive collection of tourist pamphlets in the entryway!"
957,"Becky's Diner is truly an institution on the waterfront in Portland. Breakfast are traditional, everything is made from scratch including pancakes and muffins.

One thing that most people do not think about is their lunch menu... They have a l lobster roll to die for, as you can imagine, being on the wharfs of Portland they have the freshest fish and seafood possible.

Becky's Diner is not only a favorite for tourists, local business men and Women along with local fishermen are there every morning."
958,"I had a great breakfast here this morning! I had a spinach, tomato and cheese omelette and a side of bacon. The bacon was the best decision of the meal. It was thick and crispy and perfectly cooked! I am still dreaming about that bacon. Service was also good. The waitress was sweet and efficient, and the food came out very quickly."
959,I love this place! Everything I have got to eat here has been so fresh and tasty!!! And service is outstanding
960,"There is nothing more you could want from a diner - good, friendly service with a decent menu and a great cup of coffee. The blueberry pancakes are amazing (not pictured as I had the steak and eggs), but everything was great, and the prices were good as well."
961,Finally made it over to Becky's.   Worth the drive up from NH.  I am a breakfast girl and everything was great. Very friendly attentive staff. The best coffee I have had in a diner. It is from a local PORTLAND roaster and us freshly ground from whole beans on site!   Highly recommend a visit to Becky's
962,"Order the Lobster & Swiss on a Biscuit!!! Secret Menu - little North meets South. ""The Gabby"""
963,"Old School Dining never got better!  Breakfast served from essentially 4:30 am (for the fishermen) all the way to closing.  There's also a lunch & dinner menu each with a bit more time restriction.  No complaints as long as breakfast is served!

This is a family run operation by Becky and Her Clan.  We pulled in for dinner on the day of Portland's Festival.  Every joint in the hub of Old Port up to Middle Street were jammed and more focused on keeping the post festival drinkers, drinking.  No complaints here either, but DANG IT I was HANGRY!

Just a littler further down Commercial is Becky's an Oasis and Focus on good home styled cooking with less focus on the bar action.  They do offer a bar...and a nice covered deck.

We however, chose a quiet booth near other Diner DockIt's.  The wife ordered the twin 1 lb lobster dinner and I desired a real breakfast, but real a Maine Breakfast.  Yes, the Lobster Omelette with grilled onions, peppers and chedda' cheese.  It was too last for home fries and hash, but the house cut fries blended nicely.  We both had probably the best meal of the weekend and for me in a thousand breakfasts (day or night).

So good, we passed on the mouth watering and mesmerizing homemade desserts; to highlight a few, bread pudding and nearly any pie you could imagine.

Power the Becky and Her People!"
964,"Within an hour of landing at PWM, our party of five sought out a highly recommended local establishment - Becky's Diner. The place was hopping at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon - a good sign. We were seated in a timely manner, received excellent service, and ordered both breakfast and lunch options. The Lobster Rolls were raved about by two of our group. This is a place worth returning to and recommending to others."
965,Delicious lobster roll and blueberry pie! Nice outdoor patio too. Not too many healthy options exactly - the asparagus was very buttery- but very good diner food.
966,"Becky's once again did not disappoint! 
As before, the service and food were excellent.
They have a very versatile menu. The prices are so reasonable.
We both had perfectly poached eggs with ham.
My husband also had blueberry pancakes. They were just so so.
The coffee they serve, Coffee By Design, is our favorite. They only sell it in Portland where it is made.
We will gladly return again when in Maine."
967,Home style food that hits the spot. Where the locals go. Serves breakfast all day. Portions are plentiful. Enjoyed it so much I'm going back tomorrow.
968,"We stumbled on this place for lunch and no regrets here at all. 

I will say.. parking can be a bit of a buzzkill.. but trust me.. its all worth it if you manage to get a spot. We got there and waited about 5-10 minutes for a table given it was noon. I started off with a cup of haddock chowder and then moved on to the lobster roll meal. Imagine Shaggy from those classic Scooby Doo episodes scarfing down a mountain of food.. that was basically me with all of this. The chowder was great, and the roll with the side of fries and cole slaw hit the spot easily. The best part of this whole place is the dessert though. I had the carrot cake.. though I would have definitely taken a sampler of all that they had in the dessert display. 

If looking for a chill diner with amazing food, Becky's is definitely the spot to check out!"
969,"An old standard that has become increasingly popular and changed, perhaps not for the better. It's no longer the endearing hole-in-the-wall it once was. But the food is decent and people there are friendly. One thing that absolutely has got to change is their abysmal parking situation where you often need to park behind someone in their small lot and frequently need to move your car/ask someone else to move theirs. I once went out to move my car to let someone out at their request and while I was doing that someone had cleared my plate because they thought I had left. They offered me another meal free of charge of course, but I mean jeez...."
970,"First time leaving a review, but it was my civic duty to say something. I've had many omelletes in my day, but the Titanic omellete at Becky's Diner was AMAZING! The 4 eggs, sausage, bell peppers, onions and cheese was the perfect combo! I couldn't stop eating it! It was so good that I refrained from using ketchup because it would have ruined the flavor harmony. I could go on...

That was just the omellete, then came the blueberry pancakes... Wow! Complemented by the syrup, those blueberries were a burst of flavor in every bite. 

The service was good, fast, and friendly. 

All that to say that I will be going back, and if you want your taste buds awakened, I recommend you do the same."
971,"Old fashioned Maine diner with reasonable prices and good selection. Staff is courteous and professional. 

Food is good with reasonable portions. Seating is a bit cramped, but there is only so much room they have to work with. 

They have some parking but mostly you have to find someplace on the streets nearby"
972,"10-10-17 4PM sandwiches lunch for 2 

Haddock Chowder - thin not rich broth, not much haddock and way to many potatoes.....actually I was not impressed and would not order it again. 
Haddock sandwich loaded.......a lot of Haddock and ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT. 
Breakfast order -
2 fried eggs - very good
Bacon - good
Home fried potatoes - good but not exciting 
Marbled rye toast - excellent 
Pancakes with maple syrup - excellent 
Coffee - very good
Rachel Ray loved this place but I am not excited. 
Parking at side of restaurant and some in front BUT limited. 
Cute Mom and Pop style diner.....very clean and pleasant waitresses. 
I WOULD Come Back"
973,"YAY! A traditional diner, but if you don't know what that means and want to find out, you should definitely visit.  Such good sausage and omelettes!!"
974,Came her twice my first day in Portland. Well worth the wait during the breakfast rush!
975,"We went to Beckys for breakfast, we waited for 15 minutes until we were seated, the place was hopping with activity. The wait staff was friendly and courteous. Our order came out hot and didnt take to much time. The food choices were varied. The blueberry muffins were yummy. The prices were fair"
976,"We had an amazing experience at Becky's Diner! The lobster roll was jam packed with the freshest and tastiest lobster, and the scallop platter was incredible! Highly recommend Becky's and can't wait to get back up here!"
977,"Becky's doesn't need my review, but being their neighbor, I feel compelled to add to all feedback. It's a mainstay for brunch for me. Very reasonable prices, and if you leave hungry, you ordered wrong. Service is usually friendly, though I've absolutely caught them on some off mornings. The brunch menu is uncomplicated, which is sometimes a welcome change from fancier fare around the peninsula. 

The wait picks up early, so aim for before 9.30am and be ready to sit at the booth. Honestly, the booth is where it's at anyway - I love a good diner barstool."
978,"A place which does not look much  from outside. Its not even in the busy part of the city (near the port ) where you will find a lot of talked about restaurants.
But be assured the food, if anything, is much better than those restaurant.
I had a Fisherman's Platter which is Fried North Atlantic Shrimp, Haddock,
Scallops & Whole Belly Clams.It was a great platter.
The  Haddock Chowder, It is a little different than any other chowder.
These guys dont use any kind of flour as thickening agent hence a runny gravy and I can taste the milk in it.
One thing which stood out  was the amount of fish in the chowder."
979,Just a quick local diner to grab breakfast. It was pretty packed during our visit and we saw local folks coming in and out. The service was very simple nothing fancy.  The food was good and the wait was not long. we loved walking outside while it was our turn to be seated. I loved how I did not come out smelling like a diner after. Always a plus when traveling. Will like to visit again if ever in town.
980,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon while visiting Portland. This place had good reviews on Google for lobster rolls so I decided to come by. I get there and there is a line coming out the door. I had the option of putting my name on a waitlist and waiting about 20 minutes. However, I decided to order a carry out. 
I got the lobster roll and it was cheaper than other restaurants in the area. I liked that it was very simple. First time trying a lobster roll and I liked the clean taste of the lobster. The order came with a side of fries and cole slaw. I chose melted butter over mayo. 
The fries were the best part of the dish in my opinion. Lobster was a bit underwhelming and didn't meet my high expectations. 

The service was fast and nice."
981,"I have eaten both breakfast and lunch here usually as a Portland stopover on our trips to parts further north in Maine.  Becky's is a classic diner with a traditional American/New England diner menu and a full breakfast to dinner menu.
The service is friendly and unpretentious.  The food is good with generous portions.  On this most recent visit we stopped in for a late lunch en route home after a vacation in Camden.
I ordered a cheeseburger which was so delicious.  Hamburgers fall into the category of deceptively simple foods....like omelettes. Simple fare but hard to get right.  A good to great hamburger requires starting with excellent quality beef, the correct ratio of fat to meat (so that the burger is juicy) and a deft hand on the grill.  Score for the burgers at Becky's!   There are several choices of cheese for a cheeseburger.  I chose the pepper jack and I loved every juicy, tender bite.
My husband had the special sandwich of the day which was a classic Reuben which he loved.
They offer their sandwich breads with gluten free options which is nice.
We each had a glass of a local craft beer called Gritty's.  It was a hot day and the beer, which was recommended by our waitress, was refreshing and light.

The rotating dessert case at the front of the restaurant is quite a marvel.  The case reminded me of my NYC days when every diner had one of these rotating wonders as a way to showcase the array of desserts.  Becky's has an amazing selection of beautiful looking cakes and other desserts.  We didn't partake of any but the selection was hard to resist.
We will most certainly return to Becky's....it is a good place to stop for a bite.

PS The women's bathroom was neat and clean!"
982,"The only reason this didn't get a 4 was the wait. This place is always packed. We waited 50 mins to sit and about 20-25 to get served, when we left the line was longer. 
If you can wait make this place a must stop for breakfast. I got the homemade hash and wife got the wharf breakfast. Corn beef was awesome and my wife's bacon and French toast some of the best ever had. 

If you have the time be sure to stop."
983,"Great traditional breakfast at this quaint Portland diner! 

We had breakfast here around 9am on a Friday. We easily found parking, were greeted and seated quickly, our waitress, Millie, could not have been nicer, and the food was delicious. Big portions, very reasonable prices, and an overall positive experience. 

Oh and a cute little side note: they have men's, women's, and children's (changing room) restrooms - I've never seen this before and thought it was clever. 

If you are looking for a hearty breakfast to hit the spot, check out Beck's."
984,"Delicious!

We (party of 5) were in Portland for a long weekend and decided to end our trip with Becky's. Yes, Sundays are extremely busy (we were told that they were slammed more than usual because of the time change), and there was a 30-40 minute wait at 11:30 AM. Well worth it! 
Decor: Not too kitschy, but more classic diner. Booths, counter, big hand warming mugs, cake and pie case, Maine waterfront artwork. Loved the crushed ceramic vases and curtains! Those are really neat. 

Food: We all had breakfast. Blueberry muffin (grilled), pancakes, blueberry pancakes, bacon, Hobson's Wharf platter, scrambled eggs (one with cheese and ham-bits), loaded hash browns and the homemade corned beef hash. I think I must go back to Portland sooner than later just to get some more of that hash. Big bites of tender pull apart corned beef...absolute heaven. 
Bottomless cups of coffee as well! 

Thanks! See you soon!"
985,"3.5 stars, but not rounding up today. Yelp, you kind of let me down. 

It's an unassuming diner & nothing finer. Service was friendly, food was good, but not the best ever. Lobster roll was not bad, but definitely not the best. I don't know why they're listed as one of the best places to get a lobster roll. I did a lot of research & I should've just taken my friends elsewhere, but it was an experience. The clam strips were not bad, but I loved the onion rings the most. Yum! Cole slaw was not great. Just because it's a diner doesn't mean it has to have the standard boring cole slaw. I really think they can improve their dish without making it pretentious. Maybe a little more acidity would make it better. 

As for the lobster roll....well, the lobster is fresh since they have a tank of the lobsters in the restaurant. However, the roll itself is nothing fancy. It's really small & their mayo isn't homemade or original in its creation, it's just from a jar. Same goes for the butter. Becky's is A-OK. It really isn't the best, it's not the worst, but it's good. While the lobster roll itself is really small, the portions of the sides are huge. I felt full. I felt disgusted. I gotta stop ordering fried food, but I can't help it."
986,"Okay, I am going to drop a 5 Star review here because as far as diners go, Becky's really delivered. I visited here during a recent road trip from southern New Jersey and am glad I did. The Fried Haddock platter I had was astounding and outstanding. It was absolutely sumptuous, for want of of a ""50 cent"" qualifier. The price was reasonable as well and I'd happily recommend and stage a return here when I wander up to Maine again."
987,"Got the smothered hash browns with onions, peppers, ham and cheese. So delicious, I can't wait to go back!"
988,"Good greasy spoon. Nothing fancy but there table service and speed is awesome 

Love the table pepper sauce made in Portland , yumm on eggs 

If you want fast , bacon eggs and pancakes with kids come here 

Portland Isn t a big breakfast town so choices are few"
989,"A great, solid American breakfast spot. Order the hobson's wharf special with blueberry pancakes! Everything we had was satisfying. While the blueberry pancakes were good, didn't see what the hype was. Lots of fresh blueberries? It was worth going (it was our first time in Portland, and wanted to try all the local hot spots), but didn't think it was particularly exceptional. We went too early so didn't get to have the chowder or any seafood dishes (served after 11am), so that can be a good reason to visit again."
990,"Great breakfast food in Portland, Maine. What a find! This place has a view of the water and has the energy of a small town diner. It's a place where people go to enjoy good company and good food.
There were six of us and we were seated rather quickly. This aid a popular place and there is more difficulty finding a parking space than a table. The food is fresh a and the the coffee hot and tasty. The portions were of better than average size and a good value for the money. Both of my brothers in law ordered the fresh hash and said it was the best they have ever had.
My eggs were over easy and just right. the bonus pancake was a hit at our table, and it was a substantial size for the price.

The service was pretty good as well.

Thanks Becky!"
991,Local diner with good prices and a good breakfast. Daily specials and a full menu. It gets really busy so prepare for a wait.
992,"They need a much bigger lobster tank, it was really depressing watching them piled on top of eachother like jenga, completely unable to move... but the food was wonderful. We had a breakfast sandwhich, eggs over easy with toast and bacon and a gluten free benedict (not sure if it's ok for someone with celiac, this was for a barley allergy, contamination isn't too big a deal). All were great. I will come here again, for certain. 

Staff are super nice, clientele are fun, wait wasn't too bad, but parking is a bit difficult."
993,"I can't believe how much food I got for less than $10 - our entire table (family of four) left bursting and happy with our delicious, filling breakfasts. This place opens at 4AM - presumably for local fisherman - which makes it an option no matter how early you need to start your day. The service was quick and friendly and this is simply good, affordable breakfast food."
994,"Five stars because it's the best diner on the planet.
Ask locals where to go - ""Becky's "" we will tell you, ""obviously.""
One problem and tip: parking is always difficult- park along Commercial, down a ways; the walk will do you good and permit you to rationalize that piece of fabulous home made pie."
995,"I wanted to give this place a great review as I remembered it being so much more from when I was younger, but I just was not impressed when I brought my out of town friends here post Thanksgiving... Granted it was Black Friday and they were non-stop busy... but I figured this place was ALWAYS that busy! We were seated relatively quickly for the amount of people waiting which was nice, but then having not been there in years, and my friends being there for the first time, the friendliness was unexpectedly absent. We had called ahead of time to ask if they served Eggs Benedict, to which the person on the phone told us they did in fact have, as this was a craving of one of us, and upon arrival, were told ""only on Sundays""... would have been nice to have heard that when we called specifically asking on that. 

Our waitress looked and acted as though she would have rather been anywhere else in the world but there at that moment. We were afraid to ask her any questions about anything and stuck to pretty basic orders... the food was still really good and I was BEYOND happy with my cheese and bacon omelet... SO MUCH bacon and cheese. But when seeking out a Maine favorite, the overall experience lacked quite a bit."
996,We eat there when visiting our grandson in Portland Good food & service. Reasonable prices too.
997,"This may be one of my most favorite diners I have ever visited. I'm all for a local good diner and this is 100% that! 
We woke up wanting serious breakfast, you know that breakfast craving where you want a table full of breakfast food and u don't care how full ur gonna get, that was us. 
We got there and the line was out the door and it was freezing that morning. So cold. But local people were waiting and that's a good sign. 
We were offered a spot at the counter and sitting on a counter stool eating breakfast and watching the chaos of the diner just made it even more perfect.  Everyone was so nice, even the locals who sat next to us were extremely welcoming. The waitress was so good and despite being busier than most of us have ever been she was nice and attentive and checked on us, our coffee was always full and we had everything we needed for the breakfast we wanted. 
This is the diner that the locals love, the fisherman get their 4am breakfast before heading out, and I bet some tourists skip. 
I loved this place and the experience we had there. It was our last breakfast in Portland and I'm so glad we took a chance on this diner. 
It's one of the places I can't wait to go back to."
998,"Best lobster roll in town. Big, lots of meat, excellent flavor. 

Scallops were awesome too"
999,"Breakfast review....eggs, bacon, toast was good, nothing special just plain good,, solid home cooked food. Price was average so for a tourist town I guess thats saying a lot. So breakfast for 2 was $22. Staff was attentive and the place was packed....right on out the door"
